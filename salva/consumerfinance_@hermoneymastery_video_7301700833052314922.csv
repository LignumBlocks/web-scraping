Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

You have other options for help
If you have a problem with a student loan, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPB about federal or private student loans.
You can file a complaint with Federal Student Aid  about federal loans. These complaints can be escalated to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group  .
Contact your state attorney general to file a complaint . Your state may also have a student loan ombudsman. Search the name of your state with “student loan ombudsman.”

Your financial well-being, or overall financial situation, is unique to you. Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.

The story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. 

How would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.

Understand where your money goes 

The prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.

1. Take our quiz to see how healthy your finances are.

Answer just 10 questions to measure your financial well-being and get a few steps for making improvements. Take it now, then take it again later to see if your story has changed.

2. Learn where your money is coming from.

Before you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.

3. Learn where your money is going.

Fill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.

4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.

If you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.

Small changes can make a big difference

There are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. 

5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.

Your cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .

6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.

If there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .

7. Compare your spending month-to-month.

Track your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.

Save for emergencies

Saving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. 

8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.

Start by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.

9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.

Set guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.

10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.

Whether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.

11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.

There may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.

12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.

For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.

Reduce your debt 

Paying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.

13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.

Use our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.

14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.

There are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.

15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.

Whether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.

16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

Plan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.

Create better money habits 

Improving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. 

17. Apply only for credit you need.

While it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.

18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.

You’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.

19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.

Through most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.

20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.

Missing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.

21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.

One of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.

Plan for success

Planning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. 

22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.

Break down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.

23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.

If you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.

24. Make your savings consistent.

Putting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .

25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.

Once you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!

If you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.

Shopping for loans and trying to get the best rates and other terms, while complicated, is like other types of comparison shopping. Shopping ahead of time will get you ready for negotiating your auto loan and make the process less stressful.

Prepare before you apply for an auto loan

You will be in a better position to shop and bargain for an auto loan if you follow these steps before you apply for a loan.

Check your credit report

The information in your credit report determines your credit scores. Your credit score plays a large part in determining what kind of auto loan you can get, and how much interest you will pay for the loan. Here are some helpful resources:

To learn about credit reports and credit scores, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores
Do you need a co-signer?

A co-signer is a person – such as a parent, family member, or friend – who is contractually obligated to pay back the loan just as you are. If your credit history is limited or needs improvement, and you have a low credit score (or no credit score), your interest rate could be significantly lower if you have a co-signer with good or excellent credit. That is because the lender will rely on the co-signer’s credit history and score in deciding to make the loan.

If you are considering having a co-signer, you and the potential co-signer should think carefully about this decision. If you do not repay your loan, you and your co-signer will be responsible for repayment. The co-signer is responsible for the loan even though he or she has no right to possession of the vehicle. In addition, any late payments made on the loan would affect both your credit record and score and your co-signer’s credit record and score. Federal law generally prohibits a lender from requiring you to have a co-signer if you apply for a loan individually and you qualify under the lender’s standards for creditworthiness for the loan. For more information on co-signing visit consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/why-might-i-need-a-co-signer-in-order-to-get-vehicle-financing-en-811.

Check current auto loan interest rates

You can research rates by contacting several banks, credit unions, or other lenders. You can also look online at many commercial sites which may give you an estimate of interest rates nationwide and by your zip code. Some commercial sites will link you to specific lenders and dealers for estimates, so you may want to be careful about entering your personal information.

Consider a down payment

A down payment will reduce the total amount that you finance because you will have to borrow less money. The larger the down payment, the lower the total cost of the loan.

Decide if you want to trade in your current vehicle

If you already own a vehicle, research its value to see how much you might get from a trade-in or private sale. You can look up the approximate value using online commercial websites such as Consumer Reports, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guides, and online classifieds. These resources may also be available at your local library. Finding examples of similar vehicles that have sold recently in your area will help you know a fair price.

Once you know approximately how much your current vehicle is worth, you can decide whether to trade it in or sell it yourself. If you trade it in at a dealership, you and the dealer will decide on the value that will be credited towards the purchase price of your next vehicle. If you sell it yourself, you can use the money you get as a down payment.

If you have an existing auto loan on your trade-in, consider your situation carefully

Carefully consider whether to take on new debt in addition to your existing debt. Here are some considerations and steps:

Get the payoff amount, which is the amount to pay off the existing loan, from your current lender before going to the dealership.
Decide if you are going to pay off your existing loan now, wait until you pay off your old auto loan before you borrow for another vehicle, or include the amount that you still owe on your current vehicle in your new auto loan.
If you owe more on your current vehicle than it is worth — referred to as being upside down — then you have negative equity. If you roll the balance of your existing auto loan into your new auto loan, this could make the new auto loan much more expensive. Your total loan cost will be higher because you will be borrowing more than just the price of your new vehicle.
After you research your trade-in’s value, if the amount you still owe on your trade-in is less than it is worth, make sure during any negotiations that you consider whether you are getting fair value for your trade-in and you are able to fully pay off the old auto loan.
Do you still owe money on your trade-in?

If you are considering rolling the balance of the old loan into your new loan, make sure you understand how this will affect the total cost of your new loan. Carefully look at the total cost of the new loan including the amount borrowed, the annual percentage rate (APR), the interest rate, the loan term (in months), and the monthly payment – before you agree to anything. If you don’t roll the amount you still owe on your old vehicle into the new loan, and keep your current vehicle while buying a new one, then you will have two loans and two monthly payments to make. Either way, you may want to consider whether it makes sense to go through with the transaction and purchase the next vehicle if you still owe money on your trade-in.

Think about optional add-ons ahead of time

When you go to an auto dealer, you will likely be offered add-on products and services for the vehicle or for the loan. It’s a good idea to think about these add-ons ahead of time, so that you have less to worry about at the dealership, and have your answers ready when you are asked to buy these extras. Common add-ons include:

Service contracts or extended warranties
Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) insurance
Credit insurance
Additional features for the vehicle, such as alarm systems, window tinting, tire and wheel protection, and other products

These products and services, which you may finance, are optional. If you buy them the price is negotiable. If you think you want to buy these products or services, shop around. For example, your own auto insurance company may offer GAP insurance, credit insurance, or other alternatives. If you finance optional add-ons as part of your loan, the amount you borrow and pay will increase.

Now that you’ve done your homework, you’re ready to take the next step: shopping for your auto loan. Use the auto loan worksheet to keep track of the loan terms and compare your choices.  Take the worksheet with you to the bank, credit union, other lender, and dealership so you can compare your loan choices and get the best deal for you.

Shop for an auto loan

Now you are ready to start shopping for a loan. Before you head to the dealership, gather your personal information and consider getting preapproved for a loan.

Shopping ahead of time will get you ready for negotiating your auto loan and make the process less stressful.

Gather your personal information

When you’re heading over to a bank, credit union, or dealership make sure to gather all the information you will need. Lenders will generally ask for this information in a loan application:

Name
Social Security Number or ITIN
Date of birth
Current and previous address(es) and length of stay
Current and previous employer(s) and length of employment
Occupation
Sources of income
Total gross monthly income
Financial information on current credit accounts, including other debts
Get preapproved for a loan

Getting a preapproved loan offer or quote with a maximum loan amount and rate from a bank, credit union, or other lender is a good place to start. If you bring a loan quote from a lender to the dealer, you may be in a stronger bargaining position to get a better deal, whether you stick with the offer you brought in or you decide to accept the dealer’s financing offer.

Preapproval also helps you stay within your budget and allows you to compare interest rates without the time pressure you may feel once you are at the dealership. Then at the dealership you can focus more on the actual price of the vehicle and your trade-in because you will already know about the loan terms that you could get. You will still have the choice to negotiate a better loan at the dealership and not use your preapproval.

If your application is preapproved, the lender will give you documents to take to the dealership. Once you are ready to buy, the dealer will make final arrangements with your lender.

Understand how shopping for a loan impacts your credit score

Shopping for the best deal on an auto loan will generally have little to no impact on your credit score(s). The benefit of shopping will far outweigh any impact on your credit. In some cases, applying for multiple loans over a long period of time can lower your credit score(s). Depending on the credit scoring model used, generally any requests or inquiries by these lenders for your credit score(s) that took place within a time span ranging from 14 days to 45 days will only count as a single inquiry. This means shopping around for an auto loan during that time span will count the same as applying for just one loan. You can minimize any negative impact on your credit score by doing all your rate shopping in a short amount of time.

Know your rights

A lender cannot discourage or deny your application for credit, or offer different prices or other terms and conditions of the loan, based on your race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance income, or good faith exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

You can submit a complaint online with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov  or with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) at consumerfinance.gov/complaint or by calling toll-free at 1-855-411-CFPB (2372)."

Welcome to this meeting of our Consumer Advisory Board.  It is a pleasure to be here in Little Rock today, and I look forward to our conversation. The feedback we receive from the members of this distinguished group invariably refines our thinking and our approach. It sheds new light on issues and helps us achieve better solutions for consumers. No doubt that will be true today.

Next month we will celebrate the fifth birthday of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. From the start, the Bureau has worked doggedly on behalf of consumers, on many fronts. In these remarks, I will describe three distinct aspects of the most recent work we are doing.

One key task has been to create new informational tools and resources that empower consumers to become savvier shoppers. We call this initiative, “Know Before You Owe,” and we have applied it to mortgages and student loans and prepaid financial products. Today, we are unveiling yet another “Know Before You Owe” initiative, this time for auto loans, with a shopping sheet, step-by-step guide, and additional online resources.

Another important goal has been to fashion new rules that protect consumers against the harms they may suffer from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. We have undertaken several years of research on the operations and effects of loans issued to consumers for quick cash. Based on what we have learned, we just issued our proposed new rule on payday, auto title, and certain other high-cost installment loans.

Finally, we look for ways to make it easier for everyone to implement our rules successfully and achieve compliance with the law. We recognize that doing so is good for consumers and for financial providers alike. One way we do that is through our eRegulations platform, an online tool we created that makes it easier to navigate, understand, and apply the regulations we are authorized to interpret, oversee, and enforce. So we will talk a bit about that as well.

***

Let me start with our “Know Before You Owe” auto initiative.  These new resources include an auto loan shopping sheet, a step-by-step guide, and additional online information. We have developed these tools and are releasing them today to help consumers take control of the auto loan process. We want consumers to use them to get a clearer picture of how much their loan will cost. The shopping sheet helps consumers break down costs and make direct comparisons between loans. All of the resources are designed to help empower consumers and aid them in taking control of the financing process to get the best result that is right for their budget.

Auto loans are the third largest category of household debt for U.S. consumers, behind only mortgages and student loans. In this country, we now have almost 100 million auto loans worth just over $1 trillion. For those consumers who do not purchase a home, an auto loan may be the largest debt they ever have. Nine out of 10 households have at least one car or truck, most of which are financed: 86 percent of new purchases and 55 percent of used purchases.

The typical consumer takes out a 60-month loan, but the length of these loans and the amount of indebtedness have been increasing over time. On average, each vehicle is owned for about eight years, which means many consumers purchase several vehicles over a lifetime, and they may regularly repeat the budgeting and financing process. Sometimes, consumers are still paying off vehicles they are no longer driving. The financing process can take the form either of “direct” lending (where consumers go to a bank, credit union, or other lender to get their loan directly before going off to buy the vehicle) or of “indirect” lending (where consumers arrange financing through an automobile dealership at the same time they buy the vehicle). Indirect financing is used for most transactions.

Before developing the “Know Before You Owe” auto loan shopping sheet and other resources, the Bureau did some research. We looked at how consumers approach the auto finance decision, and the challenges they face in navigating that process. The findings of that research can be found in a report we are releasing today entitled, Consumer Voices on Automobile Financing. Perhaps not surprisingly, our research finds that even when consumers diligently research the auto purchase itself, they often do not fully explore the available financing options. According to data from the National Financial Capability Survey, only half of consumers report comparison shopping for an auto loan. This is much like what we had found in the housing and mortgage markets, where consumers spend a lot of time finding the right house, but often do not take the time to shop for the best mortgage. And that can be very costly.

The auto loan shopping sheet can help consumers shop more effectively. It breaks down the financing terms so they can make apples-to-apples comparisons from one loan to another. Anyone can download the shopping sheet from our website at consumerfinance.gov. We encourage people to print it out, take it with them, and use it when they are talking to lenders or to auto dealers who are arranging a loan for the consumer. Specifically, it helps consumers understand the total cost of the loan as well as the monthly payment. It is important for us to understand that when we lower the monthly payment by taking out a longer loan, we will end up paying more in interest. A longer loan also puts consumers at risk of having the loan last longer than the vehicle. For too many consumers, focusing only on the whether the monthly payments are affordable does not paint the entire picture. The total cost of the loan, the number of months of debt, the interest rate, and the additional charges also are important factors.

The shopping sheet makes clear what consumers can negotiate and what they cannot. Items that they can negotiate include the price of the vehicle, the down payment, the interest rate, the length of the loan, and the trade-in value of their current vehicle. Knowing what is negotiable allows consumers to negotiate with greater power and more clarity about the ultimate result.

The shopping sheet also helps consumers watch out for add-ons and costly financing features. Consumers should make their own assessment about the potential value of optional add-ons to their purchase or their loan, such as service contracts, extended warranties, specialty insurance, and credit insurance. They also should carefully check the paperwork to be sure all loan costs and other terms are the same as what they agreed to during the negotiations.

Our website also contains information, tips, and pitfalls to watch out for, as well as a step-by-step guide to help consumers all along the way, from budgeting to signing the final documents. In short, we simply want to help people know before they owe. Consumers should feel like they are in the driver’s seat when it comes to financing their car or truck.

***

While it is fresh in my mind, let me also talk about our field hearing last week in Kansas City, where we announced our proposed new rule aimed at ending debt traps caused by loans made to consumers seeking quick cash. Our rules would cover payday loans, auto title loans, and certain high-cost installment and open-end loans. After years of work, we determined that in such markets, where lenders can succeed by setting up borrowers to fail, something needs to change.

Our extensive research into millions of such loans has brought to light several key facts. Our research found that most payday borrowers reborrow within a month and more than half of all loans occur in sequences of 10 or more. With each new loan, the consumer pays more fees and interest on the same debt. The loan that was supposed to fill a short-term need becomes a long-term debt trap. It is much like getting into a taxi just to ride across town and finding yourself stuck in a ruinously expensive cross-country journey. We found similar rates of reborrowing for single-payment auto title loans and found that one in five sequences ends with the consumer losing her vehicle.

We also researched loans from several payday installment lenders and found that over one-third of loan sequences end in default. We further found that nearly one-third of auto title installment loan sequences end in default, and more than one-in-ten end with the borrower’s car having been seized by the lender.

Currently, about 16,000 payday loan stores operate in the 36 states where this type of lending takes place, joined by an expanding number of online outlets. Some of these lenders also make auto title loans, or payday installment loans, or both. What they have in common is that they offer quick cash on terms that make it very hard for consumers to pay off their loans on time, and they have devised ways to be profitable without determining whether consumers who take out these loans can actually afford them. In the case of payday and single-payment auto title loans, this business model depends critically on repeat borrowing. For payday installment and auto-title installment loans, the business model depends primarily on access to a borrower’s account or auto title, which provides the lender with the necessary leverage to extract payments even when the borrower cannot afford them.

As we took up the task of proposing reforms, we spent much time and effort learning about state and tribal regulatory regimes, including many discussions with state payday regulators, state attorneys general, and tribal leaders. Payday lenders already have to comply with federal laws on matters such as truth-in-lending and debt collection practices. Now we are proposing to add new federal protections against lending practices that harm consumers by trapping them in debt they cannot afford. These strong, common-sense protections would apply mainstream lending principles to such loans. Traditional lenders, such as community banks, credit unions, and many finance companies, make an effort to determine a borrower’s ability to repay before offering a loan with affordable payments. Both the lender and the borrower have a mutual stake in one another’s success. But today, the borrower’s ability to repay is often entirely absent from the transaction when it comes to payday and other similar loans.

Our proposed rule seeks to address these concerns by protecting consumers from such debt traps. Let me first describe how the proposal applies to short-term loans. For these loans, the lender generally would need to apply a “full-payment” test to determine that consumers have the ability to repay the loan without reborrowing. Specifically, lenders would need to verify the borrower’s income, borrowing history, and certain key obligations to decide whether the consumer will have enough money to cover their basic living expenses and other obligations and still pay off the loan when due without needing to reborrow in the next 30 days.

Lenders could also offer a loan with a “principal payoff option,” but only under specified conditions that are directly designed to ensure that consumers cannot get trapped in an extended cycle of debt. Under this option, lenders could extend a short-term loan of up to $500, but could offer no more than two extensions to the original loan, and then only if the consumer repays at least one-third of the principal with each extension. This proposal would afford somewhat more flexibility while expressly protecting borrowers from debt traps and providing them with a simpler way to pay off their debt. To further safeguard against extended indebtedness, lenders could not offer this option to any consumer who has been in debt over the preceding year on short-term loans lasting 90 days or more.

The proposed rule takes the same basic approach to longer-term loans that it covers. Here again, it would generally require lenders to apply the same full-payment test to determine whether borrowers can pay what they owe when it is due and still meet their basic living expenses and obligations. For payday and auto-title installment loans, either with or without a balloon payment, this means consumers have to be able to afford to repay the full amount when it is due, including any fees or finance charges.

Our proposed rule would permit lenders to offer certain longer-term loans without applying the full-payment test if their loans meet specific conditions designed to pose less risk to consumers and provide access to responsible credit. In particular, we are not intending to disrupt existing lending by community banks and credit unions that have found efficient and effective ways to make small-dollar loans to consumers that do not lead to debt traps or high rates of failure. Indeed, we want to encourage other lenders to follow their model.

Therefore, our proposal would not require lenders to apply the full-payment test for loans that generally meet the parameters of the kind of “payday alternative loans” (known as “PAL” loans) authorized by the National Credit Union Administration. For these loans, interest rates are capped at 28 percent and the application fee is no more than $20. The same is true of certain installment loans that we believe pose less risk to consumers. These loans would have to meet three main conditions. First, they must be for a term of no more than two years and be repaid in roughly equal payments. Second, the total cost cannot exceed an all-in percentage rate of 36 percent, plus a reasonable origination fee. Third, the projected annual default rate on all of these loans must not exceed 5 percent. The lender would have to refund all of the origination fees paid by all borrowers in any year where the annual default rate of 5 percent is exceeded. Lenders would also be limited as to how many such loans they could make to a consumer each year.

The Bureau is also proposing new requirements to address how lenders go about extracting payments from consumer accounts for the types of loans. Our research found that when these attempts failed because they were returned for insufficient funds, online payday and payday installment lenders often made repeated attempts to extract money electronically even though they were unlikely to succeed in doing so.  When these attempts repeatedly fail, consumers risk incurring substantial fees. So these lenders would have to give borrowers advance notice before accessing their account to collect a payment. In addition, we propose what we call the “debit attempt cutoff.” After two straight unsuccessful attempts, the lender could not make further debits on the account without reaching out to the borrower to get a new and specific authorization.

Based on our review of the available evidence, we believe that under our proposal, the vast majority of borrowers would still be able to get the credit they need in an emergency. But now they would be shielded by an umbrella of stronger protections that would keep them from getting trapped in debt they cannot afford. We seek comment on this proposal from all stakeholders.

***

Finally, we want to share with everyone that we have recently added some further updates to our innovative eRegulations platform. As anyone who works with them knows, federal regulations can be difficult to navigate. Frequently readers cannot follow them carefully without having to connect information from different places, often separated by dozens or even hundreds of pages of dense text. 

We found that many people were trying to understand our regulations by perusing paper editions or using several different online tools to piece together the relevant information. Even paid subscription services, which can be expensive, often do not succeed in making things very easy. So a few years ago we created a new tool, which we call eRegulations. This tool organizes the information in a user-friendly format that lets people search through our regulations, refer to the definitions as terms are being used, and view the official interpretation alongside the regulatory text. It has drawn rave reviews from industry groups and consumer groups alike, which is no small feat.

The only real complaints about this tool were that people wanted more of it. They wanted to see it cover more of our rules. So we are glad to announce that we have now added some important additional rules to the eRegulations tool on our website, which cover further aspects of the mortgage market and consumer lending more broadly. With these new additions, we now have on the eRegulations platform the rules implementing most of the major consumer financial laws we enforce, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

We continue to look for ways to improve and expand upon this tool and we encourage you to suggest ideas that will make it even more useful in the future.

I am told that Maya Angelou spent some of her childhood here in Arkansas, and she once said, “Nothing will work unless you do.” We take that advice to heart at the Consumer Bureau, and we have been applying ourselves to support and protect consumers over the past five years. Although we would like to see the financial crisis in the rearview mirror, we are keenly aware that much important work still lies ahead of us. And we will continue our earnest efforts to create a financial marketplace that works for American consumers, responsible providers, and the economy as a whole.

We have much to discuss today and I look forward to it very much. Thank you.

The tool helps students with financial aid offers decide whether to enroll in a specific school and how to pay for it, using data and guidelines. This page explains where and how we got those numbers and guidelines.

These technical notes will:

Explain why we ask for certain information
Provide additional information about terms and programs mentioned in the tool

About sections of ""Your Financial Path to Graduation""
About the tool overall
Who this tool serves best

This tool works best if you have a financial aid offer to become a full-time, first-time student.

Full-time: you plan to enroll in the number of credit hours required to be considered a full-time student (usually 12 in a semester system).
First-time: you have not enrolled in a college class for credit before.

If you have enrolled in a postsecondary program before or you are planning less than full-time enrollment, you can still use this tool for financial planning. However, the following data points may be less accurate and/or relevant for you.

Program length

Going to school part-time may extend your program length. If you have previous credits that apply to this program, it may shorten your program length. Contact the academic advising office for help calculating how long it will take you to finish the desired program.

Projected total debt, total cost of borrowing, and estimated monthly loan payment

These estimates will not account for any student debt acquired during previous postsecondary programs. However, you can account for your current loan payments in the monthly budget tab of the “Can I afford my payment?” page.

Graduation rate

We use the 150% graduation rate, which is the portion of full-time, first-time students who successfully complete their program within 150% of the stated program length (for example, 6 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree). College Scorecard provides a 200% graduation rate (8 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree) that includes all students regardless of their full-time or first-time status.

Privacy and data sources
Protecting your privacy

This tool allows you to leave our website and return without any of your data being stored. It does not collect any of your personal information.

This tool saves your progress by capturing the numbers you’ve entered in the URL; as you proceed through the tool, a new URL will be generated. Every page of the tool offers the option to save your progress and finish later. Clicking on that will generate a pop-up window that allows you to send that URL to any email address. While the URLs are captured by analytics software, they are not stored on Bureau servers and do not tie back to any of your personal information.

External data sources used throughout the tool

For information about schools, we rely heavily on data collected and published by the U.S. Department of Education. These include:

College Scorecard 
Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) 
National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) 
List of schools under Heightened Cash Monitoring , a type of financial oversight

To estimate future budgets for various income levels and regions of the country, we use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey .


Sections of ""Your Financial Path to Graduation""
Your financial aid offer

This section compiles the costs associated with attending school as well as your funding sources for covering those costs. Along the way it provides explanations, money saving tips, and other facts to be aware of.

The function of this section depends on whether your school sent you a link to this tool that was prepopulated with information from your financial aid offer.

If you have a prepopulated link: This section will have numbers supplied by your school, allowing you to review information from your financial aid offer. You can still add in costs and funding sources not included in your offer.
If you do not have a prepopulated link: This section will require you to type in numbers from your offer, as well as costs and funding sources not included in your offer. As you do, you will notice that the labels in the tool do not exactly match the labels in your offer. You may need to add together some amounts from your letter to fit them into the provided input fields. If you are unsure about the definition of any cost or funding source in your offer, please ask the financial aid office.
School & living situation

This page asks for a lot of information about your plans for the coming school year. Here is why we asked for each of the following pieces of information:

SELECT YOUR COLLEGE AND PROGRAM TYPE

Allows the tool to bring in relevant cost, salary, and performance data from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard .

HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT IT TO TAKE TO COMPLETE YOUR DEGREE?

Allows us to project your total debt, if your plan for this year includes student loans.

Note for bachelor’s students: Though 4 years is considered the standard length of bachelor’s degrees, graduation data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)  suggests that more than half of students take longer.

WHICH TUITION RATE WILL APPLY TO YOU?

Allows the tool to bring in relevant cost from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard .

WHERE DO YOU PLAN TO LIVE WHILE IN SCHOOL?

Allows the tool to bring in relevant cost from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard . Also, if you live on campus, your housing and meals will be listed as a direct cost that you pay to the school. If you live off campus or with family, these costs are considered indirect.

ARE YOU CONSIDERED A DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT STUDENT?

Allows the tool to apply the correct limits to your federal loans when calculating your projected total debt.

Note: As mentioned above, this tool works best for full-time, first-time students.

This year’s costs

This page helps you estimate how much money you’ll need for the coming school year. We label this amount “Your estimated costs this year.” What this amount includes is explained in further detail below.

If your offer does not include costs, we supply the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard. This data has typically been submitted within the past 2 academic years, depending on the data collection cycle.We therefore recommend asking the financial aid office for more recent numbers.

YOUR ESTIMATED COSTS THIS YEAR

We break this total down into several parts, which are explained below. Some of these costs qualify to be covered by financial aid (grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans). Note that this total is an estimate – any numbers provided by the school are based on data they collected from students during previous years. Your actual costs may be higher or lower than this estimate, depending on your personal decisions about the number of classes to take, whether to buy used or new textbooks, where to live and how to feed yourself, whether to use public transit or a personal vehicle, and other factors.

Direct costs: Anything you will pay the school directly for. This includes tuition and fees – the cost of enrolling in the school and taking classes. It may also include books and supplies if your school charges you directly for them (instead of you buying them from a bookstore or other supplier), on-campus housing, meals if you buy a meal plan, and other charges like loan or student fees. These qualify for financial aid.
Indirect costs: All other expenses not paid directly to the school that are related to your education. This includes books and supplies if you source them yourself, transportation, and personal/other/miscellaneous expenses (different schools use different words). If you will not live on campus, then this category also includes housing and meals. Ask the financial aid office what they include in this category, and make sure your qualifying expenses are included in their calculations.
Additional financial obligations: Other personal obligations that do not qualify for financial aid, like car or credit card payments, or contributions to your parents’ household expenses. You should include them here anyway, so this tool can help you budget accurately. You should also check with the financial aid office if they qualify for financial aid.
ABOUT THE STATEMENT “YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MORE AID”

The Cost of Attendance is the total amount it will cost you to go to college each year. It is also the maximum amount of financial aid that you can be given. Including grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans, plus the Expected Family Contribution from your Student Aid Report, your financial aid must be less than or equal to the Cost of Attendance.

Cost of Attendance is defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, as tuition and fees, room and board (housing and meals), books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. A standard Cost of Attendance is estimated by schools and should be included in your financial aid offer. Ask the financial aid office which specific expenses are included in the standard Cost of Attendance.

If you have qualifying expenses not included in the standard Cost of Attendance, you may be eligible for more aid. Possible examples include the cost of dependent care or studying abroad, expenses related to any disabilities you may have, and the one-time purchase of a personal computer. They do not include the purchase of a personal vehicle.

If you believe your costs will exceed the standard Cost of Attendance, ask the financial aid office about filing an appeal to have your Cost of Attendance increased. If your appeal is approved, you may receive more aid.

Note: More financial aid can mean more loans – more aid does not necessarily mean more “free money” in the form of grants and scholarships.

Costs not covered yet

On most of the pages in this section, “Costs not covered yet” will appear in the upper right corner. This number is equal to “Your estimated costs this year” minus the running total of your funding. “Costs not yet covered” will go down as costs decrease or funding increases. Loan fees, also known as origination fees, are not included in your funding but they are included in your debt (see the Federal loans section of these technical notes).

Grants and scholarships

This page adds up the amount you are being offered from scholarships and grants. Most scholarships and grants do not have to be repaid. However, if you withdraw from school before finishing your classes, you might have to repay part of a grant. Grants are often based on financial need, while scholarships are usually based on merit or some other personal characteristic or status.

FEDERAL PELL GRANT

This does not have to be repaid (unless, for example, you withdraw from school).

Must have not previously earned a bachelor’s degree
Awarded based on financial need
Maximum amount changes year to year; it is $6,345 for the 2020-2021 academic year
FEDERAL SEOG (SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT)

This does not have to be repaid (unless, for example, you withdraw from school).

For undergraduates who have not previously earned a degree
Awarded based on financial need and the institution’s funding availability
Amount ranges between $100 and $4,000
OTHER FEDERAL GRANTS

Various federal agencies offer a wide variety of higher education grants. Check this page for more information on federal grants you might be eligible for and how to apply for them. 

MILITARY TUITION ASSISTANCE

This does not have to be repaid (unless, for example, you withdraw from school).

For active-duty or reserve servicemembers who are pursuing higher education
Up to $4,500 per academic year depending on your service
GI BILL® BENEFITS

This does not have to be repaid (unless, for example, you withdraw from school).

For servicemembers and veterans
Benefits include funds to cover tuition and fees, a monthly living allowance, and an annual book stipend
OTHER SERVICE MEMBER BENEFITS

There are other federal education benefits for service members and their families, such as the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. In addition to federal education benefits, states and schools may offer additional funding sources. Check this Federal Student Aid page on aid for military families.  You can also ask the financial aid office to help you find resources you’re eligible for.

Work-study

Work-study is offered by some schools as a means for students to earn money for their education. Work-study programs may or may not be federally funded.

At schools participating in the Federal Work-Study Program, federal work-study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. According to Federal Student Aid, “The program encourages community service work and work related to the student’s course of study.”  Funds from the Federal Work-Study Program are generally not available for upfront costs like tuition, as they are given to you in a paycheck as you earn them by working.

The amount listed in your financial aid offer is the maximum you can earn from those funds and it is not guaranteed. A job will not be lined up for you. If you do not find a job, you will get none of this funding. If you do find a job, you may not get the full amount if your job does not pay enough or give you enough hours. Additionally, there may be a limit on how many hours you can work each week.

Fellowships and assistantships (graduate students only)

Some graduate programs offer fellowships and assistantships as a means for student to earn money for their education. These opportunities vary from program to program. Ask the financial aid office or program leadership for more details.

Federal loans

You must be enrolled in school at least half-time to qualify for federal loans. Your program type will determine which loan types you qualify for and your borrowing limits.

The cost of borrowing depends on the interest rate and loan fee.

Interest rate: In addition to repaying what you borrowed, you will also pay interest, which is calculated as a percentage of the loan. The interest rate is set each July for all federal student loans borrowed until the following July. The rate on federal student loans is fixed (does not change) for the life of the loan.
Loan fee: A percentage of the loan that is deducted immediately from the loan amount. This reduces the amount received but not the amount that must be repaid. (For example, if the loan fee is 1%, then $10 will be subtracted from a $1,000 loan. You will only receive $990 but you would have to repay $1,000.) This percentage is set each fall for loans borrowed throughout the year.
In this tool, loan fees are included in your total debt. They are not included in your total funding.

Repayment starts six months after you finish your program, withdraw from school, or drop below half-time enrollment (grace period).

DIRECT SUBSIDIZED LOANS

The Department of Education pays any interest accruing on your loans while you are in school (at least half-time) and during your grace period. This is the cheapest federal loan option. This loan type is available only for undergraduate students with financial need. Currently, the annual limits are $3,500 in year 1, $4,500 in year 2, and $5,500 in year 3 and beyond, with a lifetime total limit of $23,000. These limits are the same for dependent and independent undergrads.

DIRECT UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS

These loans are available for all students, regardless of financial need or program type. You are responsible for the interest that accrues while you are in school and during the six-month grace period after you leave or graduate. Interest accrued during school will capitalize – get added to your interest-bearing principal – when the grace period ends and you start paying back your debt.

Tip: Paying down your accrued interest while you’re in school reduces the amount that capitalizes and therefore the amount of interest on your interest. If you make payments while you’re in school or the grace period, tell your servicer to apply them to your accrued interest, not future monthly payments.

Borrowing limits are higher for graduate/professional students as well as independent undergraduate students. Dependent undergrads can borrow as much as independent undergrads if their parents apply and are denied for a Parent PLUS loan.

For undergrads, how much you can borrow in unsubsidized loans depend on how much you borrow in subsidized loans. Suppose you are a dependent, first-year student. Your unsubsidized loan cap is $5,500. If you qualify for and borrow $3,500 in subsidized loans, then you can borrow only the remaining $2,000 in unsubsidized loans.

Depending on subsidized borrowing, the limits for dependent undergraduates are up to $5,500 in year 1, $6,500 in year 2, and $7,500 in year 3 and beyond. The lifetime total limit is $31,000.

Depending on subsidized borrowing, the limits for independent undergraduates (or dependent undergraduates whose family did not qualify for Parent PLUS loans) are up to $9,500 in year 1, $10,500 in year 2, and $12,500 in year 3 and beyond. The lifetime total limit is $57,000.

Graduate and professional students can borrow up to $20,500 per year. The lifetime total limit of $138,500 includes all federal loans for undergraduate study, with no more than $65,500 in subsidized loans.

Loans from your state, the school, or a nonprofit

Some states, schools, and nonprofits offer student loans, often through a bank or credit union. These are not loans that you arrange directly with a bank. Is that confusing? Yes! Ultimately, it won’t affect the calculations too much if you don’t categorize your loans exactly right. Regardless, make sure you shop around to get the best deal. Look at the terms: the interest rate, whether interest accumulates during school, whether you’ll have to start repaying the loan immediately after leaving school, and whether there are flexible repayment options.

Loan fees are included in your total debt. They are not included in your total funding.

Other sources (not on your financial aid offer)

This page lists other funding sources that may be available to you.

PERSONAL FUNDS

If you have savings for your education, think carefully about the portion you want to spend on this year’s costs. For a multiyear program, you may want to reserve some of this cash for future years.

FAMILY CONTRIBUTION

The amount that your family can contribute may be different from the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) listed in your financial aid offer. The EFC is calculated from your FAFSA. If your family is unable to put forth the full EFC, talk to the financial aid office about how they calculated the EFC and what your options are. These may include obtaining other grants and scholarships, borrowing more, or finding other sources of income.

ESTIMATED INCOME FROM OFF-CAMPUS JOB AND ON-CAMPUS JOB (NOT WORK-STUDY)

For the job income sources listed here, you may want to only include estimates for jobs that you already have. Depending on the economy of the school’s location, it may be difficult to find work. The financial aid office may be able to give you more information.

EMPLOYER TUITION ASSISTANCE OR REIMBURSEMENT

If you are employed and plan to keep working while you’re in school, ask your boss if they offer financial help for employees who are furthering their education. They may offer tuition reimbursement or other assistance.

Covering your costs

In the previous section you entered all the cost and funding information and kept a running total of your costs not covered yet. This section will help you come up with a plan to fund those uncovered costs.

Using student loans strategically

Not understanding debt was a common concern for many of the past, present, and future students we talked to. This page is one of hopefully many opportunities for you to better understand the commitment that student loans represent. If you choose to borrow federal student loans, you will receive further counseling on that debt from Federal Student Aid.

This page references the average debt of undergraduates at graduation. For more info on average debt at the school you have an offer from, visit the school’s profile on College Scorecard .

Make a plan

This page allows you to revisit all the previous pages and revise your costs and funding as you gather more information.

It also provides fields for PLUS loans and private loans offered by banks and credit unions (not through state agencies, schools, or nonprofits).

PARENT PLUS LOANS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

Applications for Parent PLUS loans are accepted from parents and step-parents of dependent students. Approval is based on the borrower’s credit history, but the credit check does not look at the borrower’s credit score or income.

Legally this debt belongs to the parent or step-parent. However, many students intend to repay this debt as if it were their own, so we provide an option for including the Parent PLUS loan amount in the total loan projections. This does not legally obligate the student to repay this debt.

The borrowing limit is the program’s cost of attendance, minus any other financial assistance received, including other federal loans.

The cost of borrowing includes interest and loan fees.

Interest accrues while student is in school. We recommend that Parent PLUS borrowers make payments while the student is in school to reduce capitalization – the addition of accrued interest to the interest-bearing principal.
Interest rate is set each summer and remains fixed for the life of the loan. The amount borrowed each year will be subject to that year’s interest rate.
Loan fee: A percentage of the loan that is deducted immediately from the loan amount. This reduces the amount received but not the amount that must be repaid. (For example, if the loan fee is 1%, then $10 will be subtracted from a $1,000 loan. You will only receive $990 but you would have to repay $1,000.) This percentage is set each fall for loans borrowed throughout the year.
If you check the box to include this debt in your total debt projections, then loan fees are included in that debt. They are not included in your total funding.

Repayment starts 60 days after the second disbursement of the loan. For example, for a Parent PLUS loan divided between fall semester and spring semester, repayment would begin approximately in March. The Parent PLUS borrower can request a deferment while the student is enrolled in school at least half time, but it is not automatic. We recommend making payments while the student is in school to reduce capitalization – the addition of accrued interest to the interest-bearing principal, which results in paying interest on interest.

GRAD PLUS LOANS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

Applications are accepted from graduate and professional students. Approval is based on the borrower’s credit history, but the credit check does not look at the borrower’s credit score or income.

The borrowing limit is the program’s cost of attendance, minus any other financial assistance received, including other federal loans.

The cost of borrowing includes interest and loan fees.

We recommend making payments on interest while you are in school to reduce capitalization – the addition of accrued interest to the interest-bearing principal, which results in paying interest on interest.

PRIVATE LOANS

Some banks and credit unions offer loans for undergraduate and/or graduate students. The specific terms of each private loan can vary, and private loans are not always available. You should explore all grant, scholarship and federal loan options before taking out a private student loan. If you think you will need a private student loan, you have the right to shop around to find the best deal.

Unlike federal loans, private loans require a credit check. Borrowers may need to apply with a cosigner to meet credit standards or qualify for a lower interest rate.

The cost of borrowing includes interest rates and loan fees, also referred to as origination fees. Private loans usually carry higher interest rates than federal loans. Many private loan products charge variable rates that change over the life of the loan, unlike federal loans. Interest generally starts accruing while you are still in school.

Repayment typically starts after you leave school, and most lenders currently offer a six-month grace period. Some private loans programs require borrowers to start making monthly payments during school or right after graduation. Private lenders usually do not offer the flexible repayment options that are available for federal student loans.

Affording your loans

The previous sections helped you add up your costs and funding sources and then make a plan to pay for the coming school year. This section helps you check the long-term affordability of the debt included in your plan.

Is this too much debt?

For undergraduates, some financial aid commentators recommend keeping your total debt under the salary you expect to make your first year out of school. This recommendation is meant to serve as a guidepost to help you determine if you may be borrowing too much.

However, it is a broad generalization that doesn’t apply to every person or every situation. You should consider all your options before making a decision. This guideline is meant to assist with your decision-making process, not to dictate it.

Note: If you are considering a career in public service, you should explore the U.S. Department of Education’s income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which could result in lower monthly payments and eventual forgiveness of some federal student loan debt.

Here is more information on the debt and salary numbers we provide.

PROJECTED TOTAL DEBT

To estimate the projected total debt, we add up all the loans in your plan for this year (including loan fees). Assuming similar borrowing patterns, we also project your loans during the remaining program years, and then add it all together. We include interest accrued while you were in school.

This projection depends on the length of the program entered on the first page of the tool, “School & living situation.” It also depends on the type(s) of loan(s) you plan to borrow.

Here is how we make projections for different types of loans:

Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans: We assume that you will continue to borrow the same percentage of your annual loan limit.
For example, suppose you are planning for the first year of a two-year program. If your plan includes 100% of the subsidized loan limit ($3,500) and 80% of the remaining unsubsidized loan eligibility ($1,600), then we assume for the second year that you will borrow 100% of the subsidized limit ($4,500) and 80% of the remaining unsubsidized loan eligibility ($1,600 again), for a total of $11,200.
For all other types of loans – including loans from your state, the school, or a nonprofit; federal PLUS loans; and other private loans from banks and credit unions – we assume that your borrowing will remain exactly the same for the remaining years in your program. In other words, projected non-federal debt equals this year’s non-federal debt times the length of the program.
Due to the annual increases in costs, this is likely to result in an underestimation of your total debt.
Accrued interest: We assume that the interest rate will remain the same for the remaining years of your program. That is not necessarily the case – it is set every July – but we have no way to predict if it will go up or down. These rates are set by the laws governing federal student loan programs, including the Higher Education Act.

MEDIAN SALARY OF THIS SCHOOL’S RECENT STUDENTS

This is the median earnings of students working and not enrolled 6 years after starting at this school. It includes students who did not graduate. This data is reported by the school to the IPEDS. Program-level salary data may be available on College Scorecard. You can also use the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Wage Data site to research your potential earnings .

Two things to keep in mind about this number:

The median is the middle: half of students earned more, but half earned less.
It is based on students who started your program several years ago and who may not have graduated. Economic conditions regularly change, and your experience may be different.
What will interest cost me?

To determine your estimated monthly student loan payment, we take your projected total debt from “Is this too much debt?” and calculate your total interest over a standard 10-year repayment period, which would be 120 months.

If you owe more than $30,000 in Federal Direct loans, you are eligible to enroll in the extended repayment plan, which can stretch the term of the loan from 10 years to 25 years. Lengthening the term will lower the monthly payment but increase the total repayment cost.

Also, federal student loans have other repayment plan options for repaying your federal student loans, including Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Based Repayment Plans (IBR), which are based on your income. Your loan servicer will notify you of your repayment options before your grace period ends. Also, you have the right to switch to another available repayment plan at any time during the repayment of your loans. Learn about other repayment options.

Can I afford my payment?

To determine your estimated monthly student loan payment, we take your projected total debt from “Is this too much debt?” and calculate your monthly payment (accounting for accrued interest) over a standard 10-year repayment period, which would be 120 months.

We then offer two different illustrations of this monthly payment.

$15/HOUR TAB

This tab estimates the number of hours you’d have to work to cover your monthly payment, if you take home $15 an hour. To take home $15 an hour, your wage would have to be higher; how much higher depends on what state you live in, how many dependents you have, and other details of your tax situation.

MONTHLY BUDGET TAB

This section shows large categories of typical expenses once you leave school. They are prepopulated with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure (BLS CE) Survey, based on the average expenses for someone earning your projected yearly salary and living in one of four broadly defined geographical regions in the United States (the Midwest, the Northeast, the South, and the West). The tool defaults to the region where the school is located, but you can change that if you plan to live somewhere else after graduation.

Categories of BLS CE data:

Housing (includes utilities, cell phone bills, and house repairs)
Food
Clothing (apparel and services)
Transportation
Healthcare (includes health insurance and prescriptions)
Entertainment spending
Pension and Social Security
Taxes
Other (cash contributions, alcohol, tobacco, personal care products and services, reading, education, and miscellaneous expenses)

We’ve added a line item for debt payments, in case that is part of your budget. You can change any of the default average amounts shown in the worksheet to better represent your actual budget once you leave school.

The tool then takes your average monthly salary (yearly salary divided by 12) and subtracts your estimated monthly student loan payment and other expenses indicated to estimate how much is left over at the end of the month. This may be a negative number, showing that your costs are more than your projected income.

Keep in mind that the expenses in the tool are for an average household, rather than an individual student. Your own expenses may differ depending on your age, family size, and other factors. For example, the cost of living in your particular town or city may differ substantially from the average cost of living in the relevant geographic region.

Worth your investment

This section provides some statistics about the school you’re considering, as well as a chance to review your plan line-by-line.

Compare this school to others

Now that you understand how much debt you’re considering, this page shows you some statistics that indicate how well the school serves students compared to other schools. This is to help you decide if this school is the right investment for you.

The school profile data and statistics comes from College Scorecard. If your school does not appear in College Scorecard, or if you selected a graduate or professional program, you will not be provided with performance statistics about your school. Please contact your school or program about metrics that are important to you, such as:

On-time completion rate
Job placement rate
Loan default rate
Loan repayment rate
Persistence and retention rate

At least annually, we update the indicator to show if a school is on Federal Student Aid's list of schools under Heightened Cash Monitoring 2, also known as HCM2 . HCM2 is a more rigorous form of the financial oversight that all schools participating in Federal Student Aid receive from the U.S. Department of Education. The U.S. Department of Education explains that schools get placed on HCM2 for financial or federal compliance problems , such as “accreditation issues, late or missing annual financial statements and/or audits, outstanding liabilities, denial of re-certifications, concern around the school's administrative capabilities, concern around a schools' financial responsibility, and possibly severe findings uncovered during a program review.”

For schools with data in College Scorecard, we provide some statistics on program offerings, graduation, and student debt management. Here’s the definition of each of those statistics and why we think they’re important to consider.

NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND MOST POPULAR PROGRAMS

This information is included because program choice can affect your earning potential.

GRADUATION RATE

If you are going to school to earn more money, you need to complete your degree to get that payoff. The number we provide is the proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate within 150% of normal time. For bachelor's degrees, 150% of normal time is 6 years. For associate degrees, 150% of normal time is 3 years. For certificate programs it varies by length; for example, 150% of a typically 6-month program is 9 months.

Note: Please visit College Scorecard  for a 200% graduation rate (8 years for a 4-year bachelor’s degree) that includes all students, not just full-time, first-time students.

TRANSFER TO GRADUATION RATE (2-YEAR SCHOOLS ONLY)

If you are starting at a 2-year school in order to transfer to a 4-year program, this rate will give you additional information about the success rates of other students at this school. It measures the percent of first-time, full-time students who transferred to a 4-year institution and completed within 3 years.

DEFAULT RATE

This is a sign of how many student borrowers experienced financial distress while repaying their student debt. We provide the 3-year default rate, which is the proportion of student borrowers who defaulted on their federal loans within 3 years of starting to repay them, as a result of missing several monthly payments in a row (typically 9 for federal loans). It does not include defaults on private student loans.

REPAYMENT RATE

This tells you how many people from this school have earned enough money to start paying down their debt. This is defined as the proportion of student borrowers who have reduced the original principal balance of their federal student debt by at least $1 within 3 years of entering repayment.

USING THESE STATISTICS TO COMPARE SCHOOLS

In addition to seeing the school’s most recent statistics (if available), you can rank it against other schools. The gas gauge graph shows whether the school falls into the top third (green), middle third (yellow), or bottom third (red) of schools within each selected group.

If you are considering a 2-year school, it will only be compared to other 2-year schools. If you are considering a 4-year school, it will only be compared to other 4-year schools.

Here are the comparisons offered:

In the U.S.: This is the default comparison. It compares the school to all other schools in College Scorecard. For example, if you are considering a 2-year school, that school will be ranked against all other 2-year schools with statistics in College Scorecard.
By state: Clicking this ranks the school against all the other schools in the same state. For example, if you are considering a 2-year school in Montana, this comparison will rank that school against all other 2-year schools in Montana.
Public/Private: Clicking this compares public schools to other public schools and private schools to other private schools (including for-profit institutions). For example, if you are considering a private, 2-year, for-profit school, it will be ranked against all 2-year private schools in College Scorecard, both for profit and not-for-profit.
Review your plan

This page allows you to review all the information you’ve seen and entered. This information should help you to answer crucial questions about whether you can afford this school, both this year and in the future if you are planning to borrow student loans.

DOES MY FUNDING COVER MY COSTS?

Look at “Costs not covered yet” under “Covering my costs.” If this number is more than $0, you may need to revisit your plan and find ways to either reduce costs or increase funding.

CAN I AFFORD ANY LOANS I MAY NEED?

The section “Affording your loans” offers a few different ways to evaluate the long-term affordability of the debt you’re considering. These include:

whether your projected total debt is less than your expected salary
the estimated total cost of borrowing that debt on a 10-year repayment plan
the affordability of your monthly payment, including comparisons between the projected monthly payment versus a $15 hourly wage and versus a typical budget at your expected salary.
IS THIS SCHOOL THE RIGHT INVESTMENT FOR ME?

If your school reports statistics to College Scorecard, we can provide information about available programs, graduation rates, and student success in managing their debt. You can also use this page to compare financial aid offers from multiple schools, line by line, apples to apples.

What to do next

The list of possible next steps depends on the type of program you selected. Remember that any changes you made to your offer in ""Your Financial Path to Graduation"" do not affect your actual financial aid offer or your ability to accept the original offer. You will need to contact the school’s financial aid representative and work with them to have your financial aid package updated if you’d like to make changes to your original financial aid offer.

It’s always a good time to give your student debt repayment plan a check-up. Regardless of your situation, there are some basic steps you can take to avoid stress and save money in the long run.

Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

5/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage

A 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) or 5-year ARM is a mortgage loan where “5” is the number of years your initial interest rate will stay fixed. The “1” represents how often your interest rate will adjust after the initial five-year period ends. The most common fixed periods are 3, 5, 7, and 10 years and “1,” is the most common adjustment period. It’s important to carefully read the contract and ask questions if you’re considering an ARM.

Learn more about how adjustable rates change. 

Ability-to-repay rule

The ability-to-repay rule is the reasonable and good faith determination most mortgage lenders are required to make that you are able to pay back the loan.

Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)

An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan for which the interest rate can change, usually in relation to an index interest rate. Your monthly payment will go up or down depending on the loan’s introductory period, rate caps, and the index interest rate. With an ARM, the interest rate and monthly payment may start out lower than for a fixed-rate mortgage, but both the interest rate and monthly payment can increase substantially. 


Learn more about how ARMs work and what to consider.


Amortization

Amortization means paying off a loan with regular payments over time, so that the amount you owe decreases with each payment. Most home loans amortize, but some mortgage loans do not fully amortize, meaning that you would still owe money after making all of your payments.


Some home loans allow payments that cover only the amount of interest due, or an amount less than the interest due. If payments are less than the amount of interest due each month, the mortgage balance will grow rather than decrease.  This is called negative amortization. Other loan programs that do not amortize fully during the loan may require a large, lump sum “balloon” payment at the end of the loan term. Be sure you know what type of loan you are getting.

Learn more about the homebuying process.

Amount financed

It means the amount of money you are borrowing from the lender, minus most of the upfront fees the lender is charging you. 

Read more
Annual income

Annual income is a factor in a mortgage loan application and generally refers to your total earned, pre-tax income over a year. Annual income may include income from full-time or part-time work, self-employment, tips, commissions, overtime, bonuses, or other sources.  A lender will use information about your annual income and your existing monthly debts to determine if you have the ability to repay the loan.

Whether a lender will rely upon a specific income source or amount when considering you for a loan will often depend upon whether you can reasonably expect the income to continue.

Learn more about why your ability to repay is important to lenders.


Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

An annual percentage rate (APR) is a broader measure of the cost of borrowing money than the interest rate. The APR reflects the interest rate, any points, mortgage broker fees, and other charges that you pay to get the loan. For that reason, your APR is usually higher than your interest rate.

Learn how to compare APRs 


Appraisal fee

An appraisal fee is the cost of a home appraisal of a house you plan to buy or already own. Home appraisals provide an independent assessment of the value of the property. In most cases, the selection of the appraiser and any associated costs is up to your lender.

Learn more about the homebuying process.


Automatic payment

Automatic payments allow you to set up recurring mortgage payments through your bank. Automatic payments can be a convenient way to make sure that you make your payments on time. 

Balloon loan

For mortgages, a balloon loan means that the loan has a larger-than-usual, one-time payment, typically at the end of the loan term. This one-time payment is called a “balloon payment, and it is higher than your other payments, sometimes much higher. If you cannot pay the balloon amount, you might have to refinance, sell your home, or face foreclosure. 

Find out why balloon loans might be risky. 


Bi-weekly payment

In a bi-weekly payment plan, the mortgage servicer is collecting half of your monthly payment every two weeks, resulting in 26 payments over the course of the year (totaling one extra monthly payment per year). By making additional payments and applying your payments to the principal, you may be able to pay off your loan early. Before choosing a bi-weekly payment, be sure to review your loan terms to see if you will be subject to a prepayment penalty if you do so. Check if your servicer charges any fees for a bi-weekly payment plan. You may be able to accomplish the same goal without the fee by making an extra monthly mortgage payment each year.

Closing Disclosure

A Closing Disclosure is a required five-page form that provides final details about the mortgage loan you have selected. It includes the loan terms, your projected monthly payments, and how much you will pay in fees and other costs to get your mortgage.

Learn how to double-check that all the details about your loan are correct on your closing disclosure.

Construction loan

A construction loan is usually a short-term loan that provides funds to cover the cost of building or rehabilitating a home.

Conventional loan

A conventional loan is any mortgage loan that is not insured or guaranteed by the government (such as under Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or Department of Agriculture loan programs). 

Learn more about conventional loans and other loan types.


Co-signer or co-borrower

A co-signer or co-borrower is someone who agrees to take full responsibility to pay back a mortgage loan with you. This person is obligated to pay any missed payments and even the full amount of the loan if you don’t pay. Some mortgage programs distinguish a co-signer as someone who is not on the title and does not have any ownership interest in the mortgaged home. Having a co-signer or co-borrower on your mortgage loan gives your lender additional assurance that the loan will be repaid. But your co-signer or co-borrower’s credit record and finances are at risk if you don’t repay the loan.

Learn more about the homebuying process.


Credit history

A credit history is a record of your credit accounts and your history of paying on time as shown in your credit report. Consumer reporting companies, also known as credit reporting companies, collect and update information about your credit record and provide it to other businesses, which use it make decisions about you. Credit reports have information about your credit activity and current credit situation such as your loan paying history and the status of your credit accounts.

Learn more about checking your credit history before buying a home.


Credit report

A credit report is a statement that has information about your credit activity and current credit situation such as loan paying history and the status of your credit accounts. Lenders use your credit scores and the information on your credit report to determine whether you qualify for a loan and what interest rate to offer you.

Find out how to get a copy of your credit reports.

Credit score

A credit score predicts how likely you are to pay back a loan on time. Companies use a mathematical formula—called a scoring model—to create your credit score from the information in your credit report. There are different scoring models, so you do not have just one credit score. Your scores depend on your credit history, the type of loan product, and even the day when it was calculated.

Find out where you can get your credit score.

Debt ratio

Your debt-to-income ratio is all your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. This number is one way lenders measure your ability to manage the monthly payments to repay the money you plan to borrow.

Learn how to calculate your debt-to-income ratio.


Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure

A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is an arrangement where you voluntarily turn over ownership of your home to the lender to avoid the foreclosure process. A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure may help you avoid being personally liable for any amount remaining on the mortgage. If you live in a state in which you are responsible for any deficiency, which is a difference between the value of your property and the amount you still owe on your mortgage loan, you will want to ask your lender to waive the deficiency. If the lender waives the deficiency, get the waiver in writing and keep it for your records. A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is one type of loss mitigation.

Delinquent

Delinquent is another term for being late on your payments. Your loan can become delinquent when you miss a payment or don’t make a full payment by the due date. After you are delinquent for a certain period of time, a lender or servicer may begin the foreclosure process. The amount of time can vary by state.

Federal rules may also apply to when the foreclosure may start. Learn more about your options if you can’t pay your mortgage.

Demand feature

The Closing Disclosure has a statement that reads ""Your loan has a demand feature,"" which is checked ""yes"" or ""no."" A demand feature permits the lender to require early repayment of the loan.

Read more
Down payment

A down payment is the amount you pay toward the home upfront. You put a percentage of the home’s value down and borrow the rest through your mortgage loan. Generally, the larger the down payment you make, the lower the interest rate you will receive and the more likely you are to be approved for a loan. 

Learn more about determining your down payment.

Down payment programs or grants

A down payment grant or program typically refers to assistance provided by an organization such as a government or non-profit agency, to a homebuyer to assist them with the down payment for a home purchase. The funds may be provided as an outright grant or may require repayment, such as when the home is sold.

Understand where you can get information on down payment programs and grants.


Earnest money

Earnest money is a deposit a buyer pays to show good faith on a signed contract agreement to buy a home. The deposit is held by a seller or third party like a real estate agent or title company. If the home sale is finalized or “closed” the earnest money may be applied to closing costs or the down payment. If the contract is terminated for a permissible reason, the earnest money is returned to the buyer. If the buyer does not perform in good faith, the earnest money may be forfeited and paid out to the seller.

Learn more about the homebuying process.

Equity

Equity is the amount your property is currently worth minus the amount of any existing mortgage on your property. 

Learn what a home equity loan is.

Escrow

An escrow account is set up by your mortgage lender to pay certain property-related expenses, like property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. A portion of your monthly payment goes into the account.  If your mortgage doesn’t have an escrow account, you pay the property-related expenses directly.


Find out more about how the escrow impacts your monthly mortgage payment.


Fannie Mae

The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) purchases and guarantees mortgages from lending institutions in an effort to increase affordable lending. Fannie Mae is not a federal agency. It is a government-sponsored enterprise under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

Learn more about conventional loans.

FHA funding fee

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires an FHA funding fee and a monthly insurance premium (MIP) for most of its single-family programs. This upfront mortgage insurance premium is sometimes called an upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP).

Find out if an FHA mortgage is right for you.


FHA loan

FHA loans are loans from private lenders that are regulated and insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA loans differ from conventional loans because they allow for lower credit scores and down payments as low as 3.5 percent of the total loan amount. Maximum loan amounts vary by county. 

Learn about this and other mortgage loan options.

FHA mortgage limits

FHA mortgage limits are the dollar amount limits for qualifying mortgages that the FHA will insure as part of its single-family home mortgage program. These limits are based upon location and they may be revised each year.

First-time home buyers (FTHB) loan programs

First-time home buyers (FTHB) may use a number of different types of loan programs to purchase their first home. Popular FTHB loans include programs offered by FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac with low down payments. Some programs define a FTHB as someone who hasn’t purchased a home in three years or more.

Understand your loan options.


Fixed-rate mortgage

A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of home loan for which the interest rate is set when you take out the loan and it will not change during the term of the loan.

Learn more about how fixed-rate mortgages work and what to consider.

Forbearance

Forbearance is when your servicer allows you temporarily to pay your mortgage at a lower rate or temporarily to stop paying your mortgage. Your servicer may grant you forbearance if, for example, you recently lost your job, suffered from a disaster, or from an illness or injury that increased your health care costs. Forbearance is a type of loss mitigation.

Learn more about mortgage forbearance

Depending on the kind of loan you have, there may be different forbearance options. You must contact your loan servicer to request forbearance. Remember that you will have to make up these missed or reduced payments when your forbearance period is over.

Force-placed insurance

Your servicer may require force-placed insurance when you do not have your own insurance policy or if your own policy doesn’t meet your servicer’s requirements. Force-placed insurance usually protects only the lender, not you. The servicer will charge you for the insurance. Force-placed insurance is usually more expensive than finding an insurance policy yourself.

Foreclosure

Foreclosure is when the lender or servicer takes back property after the homeowner fails to make mortgage payments. In some states, the lender has to go to court to foreclose on your property (judicial foreclosure), but other states do not require a court process (non-judicial foreclosure). Generally, borrowers must be notified if the lender or servicer begins foreclosure proceedings. Federal rules may apply to when the foreclosure may start.
If you’re concerned about foreclosure, learn how to get help.

Freddie Mac

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) is a private corporation founded by Congress. Its mission is to promote stability and affordability in the housing market by purchasing mortgages from banks and other loan makers. The corporation is currently under conservatorship, under the direction of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

HOA dues

If you’re interested in buying a condo, co-op, or a home in a planned subdivision or other organized community with shared services, you usually have to pay condo fees or Homeowners’ Association (HOA) dues. These fees vary widely. Condo or HOA fees are usually paid separately from your monthly mortgage payment. If you do not pay these fees, you can face debt collection efforts by the homeowner’s association and even foreclosure.

Learn more about the homebuying process.


Home appraisal

An appraisal is a written document that shows an opinion of how much a property is worth. The appraisal gives you useful information about the property. It describes what makes it valuable and may show how it compares to other properties in the neighborhood. An appraisal is an independent assessment of the value of the property. 

Learn more about why appraisals are important.

Home equity line of credit (HELOC)

A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a line of credit that allows you to borrow against your home equity. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any mortgage on your property. Unlike a home equity loan, HELOCs usually have adjustable interest rates. For most HELOCs, you will receive special checks or a credit card, and you can borrow money for a specified time from when you open your account. This time period is known as the “draw period.” During the “draw period,” you can borrow money, and you must make minimum payments. When the “draw period” ends, you will no longer be able to borrow money from your line of credit. After the “draw period” ends you may be required to pay off your balance all at once or you may be allowed to repay over a certain period of time. If you cannot pay back the HELOC, the lender could foreclose on your home. 


Home equity loan

A home equity loan (sometimes called a HEL) allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as collateral. Equity is the amount your property is currently worth, minus the amount of any existing mortgage on your property.  You receive the money from a home equity loan as a lump sum. A home equity loan usually has a fixed interest rate – one that will not change. If you cannot pay back the HEL, the lender could foreclose on your home. 


Home inspection

A home inspection is often part of the home buying process. You typically have the right to hire a home inspector to examine a property and point out its strengths and weaknesses. This is often especially helpful to test a home’s structural and mechanical systems including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electrical.

Learn how to schedule an inspection.


Homeowners' Association (HOA)

A homeowners' association (HOA), is typically formed to manage shared expenses such as landscaping and other maintenance costs for a planned subdivision or other organized community. Condominium HOAs take on more responsibilities including, for example, the maintenance of driveways, shared structures, and roofs.

Get more information on how HOAs may appear on your mortgage statement.


Homeowner's insurance

Homeowner’s insurance pays for losses and damage to your property if something unexpected happens, like a fire or burglary. When you have a mortgage, your lender wants to make sure your property is protected by insurance. That’s why lenders generally require proof that you have homeowner’s insurance. Homeowner’s insurance is not the same as mortgage insurance.

Learn more about the homebuying process.

Home purchase price

A home’s purchase price is the amount agreed to by the buyer and seller to be paid to the seller to purchase the home.

Learn more about finding the right home.


HUD

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a government agency that helps people get and maintain quality affordable housing. They train and sponsor housing counselors all over the country. A HUD-approved housing counseling agency can provide you with homebuyer counseling to help you understand and evaluate your options.

Find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency.

HUD-1 settlement statement

The HUD-1 Settlement Statement lists all charges and credits to the buyer and to the seller in a real estate settlement, or all the charges in a mortgage refinance. You receive a HUD-1 if you apply for a reverse mortgage or if you applied for a mortgage on or before October 3, 2015. 

Find out when you’d receive a HUD-1.

Index

The index is a benchmark interest rate that reflects general market conditions. The index changes based on the market. Changes in the index, along with your loan’s margin, determine the changes to the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan.

Understand how the index factors into the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan.

Initial adjustment cap

An initial adjustment cap is typically associated with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). This cap determines how much the interest rate can increase the first time it adjusts after the fixed-rate period expires. It’s common for this cap to be either two or five percent – meaning that at the first rate change, the new rate can’t be more than two (or five) percentage points higher than the initial rate during the fixed-rate period.

Understand how the index factors into adjustable-rate mortgage loans.


Initial escrow deposit

Interest-only loan

An interest-only mortgage is a loan with scheduled payments that require you to pay only the interest for a specified amount of time. 

Read more
Interest rate

An interest rate on a mortgage loan is the cost you will pay each year to borrow the money, expressed as a percentage rate. It does not reflect fees or any other charges you may have to pay for the loan. For example, if the mortgage loan is for $100,000 at an interest rate of 4 percent, that consumer has agreed to pay $4,000 each year he or she borrows or owes that full amount.

Explore interest rates in your area.


Interest rate cap

An interest rate cap, sometimes referred to as an annual cap, is the maximum interest rate increase that can occur annually for an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) even if the rate would have increased more under market interest rates. For example, if this cap is two percent, the new rate can’t be more than two percentage points higher than the previous rate.

Understand how lenders use the index and margin to adjust your interest rate. 


Jumbo loan

Lenders title insurance

Lender’s title insurance protects your lender against problems with the title to your property-such as someone with a legal claim against the home. Lender’s title insurance only protects the lender against problems with the title. To protect yourself, you may want to purchase owner’s title insurance.

Read more
Lifetime adjustment cap

A lifetime adjustment cap is typically used with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). This cap determines how much the interest rate can increase in total, over the life of the loan. For example, if this cap is five percent, that means the rate can never be five percentage points higher than the initial rate. Some lenders may have a different or higher cap.

Understand how the index factors into adjustable-rate mortgage loans.

Loan assumption

Loan assumption happens when a buyer takes over the mortgage from a seller when they purchase the seller’s home. The buyer takes over the remaining balance owed on the seller’s mortgage, on the original loan terms—for example, the interest rate and the remaining length of the mortgage. A loan assumption might make financial sense when new mortgages are being offered at higher interest rates than when the seller originally took out their mortgage.

The difference between the home’s sale price and the balance on the assumed loan equals the amount the buyer needs to pay, either out of pocket or by taking out their own mortgage loan.

To take over the mortgage, the homebuyer needs to qualify for the loan assumption. Qualifying is usually based on a review of the buyer’s credit and income, similar to qualifying for a new mortgage.

Loan assumption could also apply when you receive the title to a property that has a mortgage – for example, after a death or divorce.

Loan deferment

Borrowers who are struggling to make payments on a mortgage generally have the right to ask the mortgage servicer for help. The servicer can agree to a loan deferment, which allows the borrower to avoid foreclosure by postponing their overdue mortgage payments. The deferred amount comes due when the borrower refinances the loan or sells the home, or the mortgage ends in another way.

Loan modification

A mortgage loan modification is a change in your loan terms. The modification is a type of loss mitigation. A modification can reduce your monthly payment to an amount you can afford. Modifications may involve extending the number of years you have to repay the loan, reducing your interest rate, and/or forbearing or reducing your principal balance. If you are offered a loan modification, be sure you know how it will change your monthly payments and the total amount that you will owe in the short-term and the long-term.

Loan-to-value ratio

The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a measure comparing the amount of your mortgage with the appraised value of the property. The higher your down payment, the lower your LTV ratio. Mortgage lenders may use the LTV in deciding whether to lend to you and to determine if they will require private mortgage insurance.  

Learn how your loan-to-value ratio relates to your costs.

Loss mitigation

Loss mitigation refers to the steps mortgage servicers take to work with a mortgage borrower to avoid foreclosure. Loss mitigation refers to a servicer’s responsibility to reduce or “mitigate” the loss to the investor that can come from a foreclosure. Certain loss-mitigation options may help you stay in your home. Other options may help you leave your home without going through foreclosure. Loss mitigation options may include deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, forbearance, repayment plan, short sale, or a loan modification. 

If you are having trouble making your mortgage payments, or if you have been offered and are considering various loss mitigation options, reach out to a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-approved housing counseling agency.  

You can use the CFPB's ""Find a Counselor"" tool to get a list of housing counseling agencies in your area that are approved by HUD. You can also call the HOPE™ Hotline, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at (888) 995-HOPE (4673).

Margin

The margin is the number of percentage points added to the index by the mortgage lender to set your interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) after the initial rate period ends. The margin is set in your loan agreement and won't change after closing. The margin amount depends on the particular lender and loan. 

Understand how the margin factors into an adjustable-rate mortgage loan.

Monthly expenses

This is how much you spend every month. It can include, but is not limited to, recurring obligations like rent or mortgage payment, utilities, car payments, child support payments, and insurance payments, as well as essentials like food. Most of these obligations will have a fixed due date.

Assess your monthly spending with this spending tracker.


Mortgage

Mortgage closing costs

Mortgage closing costs are all of the costs you will pay at closing. This includes origination charges, appraisal fees, credit report costs, title insurance fees, and any other fees required by your lender or paid as part of a real estate mortgage transaction. Lenders are required to provide a summary of these costs to you in the Loan Estimate.

Learn more about what happens at closing.


Mortgage insurance

Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. Mortgage insurance is typically required if your down payment is less than 20 percent of the property value. Mortgage insurance also is typically required on FHA and USDA loans. However, if you have a conventional loan and your down payment is less than 20 percent, you will most likely have private mortgage insurance (PMI).

Mortgage refinance

Mortgage refinance is when you take out a new loan to pay off and replace your old loan. Common reasons to refinance are to lower the monthly interest rate, lower the mortgage payment, or to borrow additional money. When you refinance, you usually have to pay closing costs and fees. If you refinance and get a lower monthly payment, make sure you understand how much of the reduction is from a lower interest rate and how much is because your loan term is longer.

Partial claim

A partial claim is a way to use mortgage insurance to help a struggling homeowner avoid foreclosure. The mortgage servicer makes a claim against the mortgage insurance for the amount of any missed mortgage payments, and the insurer sets aside the money in a separate account. Then, when the borrower refinances the mortgage, sells the home, or otherwise terminates the mortgage, the partial claim amount is paid out to the mortgage servicer. Sometimes, the partial claim amount does not cover the full amount of the missed payments, and in those cases the borrower must pay the difference.

Payoff amount

Your payoff amount is how much you will actually have to pay to satisfy the terms of your mortgage loan and completely pay off your debt. Your payoff amount is different from your current balance. Your current balance might not reflect how much you actually have to pay to completely satisfy the loan. Your payoff amount also includes the payment of any interest you owe through the day you intend to pay off your loan. The payoff amount may also include other fees you have incurred and have not yet paid. 


PCS orders

Active duty servicemembers may be given permanent change of station (PCS) orders. PCS orders are an official relocation of a servicemember (and any family living with them) to a different duty location.  If the servicemember owns a home, they may choose to sell it. If the servicemember owes more on the home than the home is worth, they may have trouble selling their home. Some servicers offer programs to allow servicemembers to sell their home and not have to pay back the rest of the loan balance. Visit servicemember resources for more information.

PMI

Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is a type of mortgage insurance that benefits your lender.  You might be required to pay for PMI if your down payment is less than 20 percent of the property value and you have a conventional loan. You may be able to cancel PMI once you’ve accumulated a certain amount of equity in your home.

Prepaid interest charges

Prepaid interest charges are charges due at closing for any daily interest that accrues on your loan between the date you close on your mortgage loan and the period covered by your first monthly mortgage payment. 

Read more
Prepayment penalty

A prepayment penalty is a fee that some lenders charge if you pay off all or part of your mortgage early. If you have a prepayment penalty, you would have agreed to this when you closed on your home. Not all mortgages have a prepayment penalty.


Principal

The principal is the amount of a mortgage loan that you have to pay back. Your monthly payment includes a portion of that principal. When a payment on the principal is made, the borrower owes less, and will pay less interest based upon a lower loan size.

Understand the difference between the interest rate and principal.


Property taxes

Property taxes are taxes charged by local jurisdictions, typically at the county level, based upon the value of the property being taxed. Often, property taxes are collected within the homeowner’s monthly mortgage payment, and then paid to the relevant jurisdiction one or more times each year. This is called an escrow account. If the loan does not have an escrow account, then the homeowner will pay the property taxes directly.

Repayment plan

A repayment plan is a structured way to make up your missed mortgage loan payments over a certain period of time. This is a type of loss mitigation. If you have trouble making your mortgage payments, your lender or servicer may allow you to enter into a repayment plan. Before entering into a repayment plan, make sure you understand the requirements of the plan and whether you will be able to make the new payments.


Reverse mortgage

A reverse mortgage allows homeowners age 62 or older to borrow against their home equity. It is called a “reverse” mortgage because, instead of making payments to the lender, you receive money from the lender. The money you receive, and the interest charged on the loan, increases the balance of your loan each month. Most reverse mortgages today are called HECMs, short for Home Equity Conversion Mortgage.

Find out what you should consider before applying for a reverse mortgage.

Right of rescission

The right of rescission refers to the right of a consumer to cancel certain types of loans. If you are buying a home with a mortgage, you do not have a right to cancel the loan once the closing documents are signed. However, if you are refinancing a mortgage, you have until midnight of the third business day after the transaction to rescind (cancel) the mortgage contract. The three-day clock does not start until you sign the credit contract (usually called the promissory note), you receive a Truth in Lending disclosure form, and you receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind.   

Second mortgage

A second mortgage or junior lien is a loan you take out using your house as collateral while you still have another loan secured by your house.

Servicer

Your mortgage servicer is the company that sends you your mortgage statements. Your servicer also handles the day-to-day tasks of managing your loan.

Your loan servicer typically processes your loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, keeps track of principal and interest paid, and manages your escrow account (if you have one). The loan servicer may initiate foreclosure under certain circumstances. Your servicer may or may not be the same company that originally gave you your loan.

Shared appreciation mortgage

Under a shared appreciation mortgage, you agree to give your lender a share of any increase in the value of your home.

Short sale

A short sale is a sale of your home for less than what you owe on your mortgage. A short sale is an alternative to foreclosure, but because it is a sale, you will have to leave your home. If your lender or servicer agrees to a short sale, you may be able to sell your home to pay off your mortgage, even if the sale price or proceeds turn out to be less than the balance remaining on your mortgage. A short sale is a type of loss mitigation. If you live in a state in which you are responsible for any deficiency, which is the difference between the value of your property and the amount you still owe on your mortgage loan, you will want to ask your lender to waive the deficiency. If the lender waives the deficiency, get the waiver in writing and keep it for your records.

Subprime mortgage

When lenders use the term, they generally mean a loan program for borrowers who do not qualify for a prime loan, often with a higher interest rate.

Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Learn more about ways to pay off your student loan debt.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.

Can a debt collector take my federal benefits, like Social Security or VA payments?
English
Español

Before a debt collector can take Social Security or VA benefits, they must sue you and win a judgment against you for the amount you owe. Then, the debt collector must get a court order that tells your bank or credit union to turn over money from your account or prepaid card. This is called garnishment.

The key to making sure your federal benefits are legally protected from being frozen or garnished is to use direct deposit to put the money into your account or prepaid card. You can sign up anytime to have federal benefits direct deposited to your bank account or loaded onto a prepaid card.

As long as I am using direct deposit, which federal benefits are protected?

Money you receive and direct deposit to your account or card from the following government programs is protected:

Social Security benefits
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits
Veteran’s benefits
Civil service and federal retirement and disability benefits
Servicemember pay
Military annuities and survivor benefits
Federal student aid
Railroad retirement benefits
Financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Doesn’t my bank or credit union have to protect two months’ worth of direct deposited benefits automatically?

When your bank receives a court order to garnish money in your account, your bank must look at your account history to see if you received federal benefits by direct deposit in the last two months. Two months’ worth of benefits are protected and remain in your account for you to use.

For example: If you receive $1,000 in Social Security each month, your bank has records showing $2,000 in Social Security was direct deposited in the last two months. The bank must allow you to use up to $2,000 in the account.
However, if you receive Social Security or VA benefits by check and then deposit the check into your bank account, the bank does not have to protect two months’ worth of benefits in the account. This means that your entire account balance could be frozen and you’ll need to go to court to prove that it comes from protected federal benefits and should not be garnished.

The debt collector is permitted to garnish money in your account that is over two months’ worth of benefits. If your account has more than two months’ worth of benefits, your bank can garnish or freeze the extra money.

For example: If you receive $1,000 in Social Security benefits by direct deposit each month, and you have $3,000 in your account, the bank can turn over $1,000 of the $3,000 to a debt collector. The bank must give you access to the remaining $2,000 so you can continue to pay bills and withdraw cash as usual.
The bank is allowed to charge you a processing fee for the garnishment in this situation.

However, if the extra money is also exempt from garnishment under federal or state law, you may be able to go to court to have your money released.

Can my benefits be garnished to pay my government debts, child support, or spousal support?

Social Security and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) can sometimes be garnished to pay money you owe to the government, such as back taxes or federal student loans, and money you owe for child or spousal support.

Some benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), are protected from garnishment – even to pay a government debt or child or spousal support.

Tip

You can use our sample letter  to tell a debt collector that your Social Security or VA benefits are protected from garnishment. You can modify the sample letter to fit your situation – for example, to identify payments that are protected under federal or state law.

Using the courts to release money after garnishment

If your bank garnishes or freezes money in your account, you must be sent a notice of garnishment. The notice explains the court procedures for claiming exemptions from garnishment and getting your money released.

A judge decides whether your money should be turned over to the debt collector, based on factors such as the source of your income and any federal or state exemptions.

It is very important for the judge to know that your money comes from Social Security, SSI, VA, or other federal or state benefits before the judge decides whether your money should be turned over to the debt collector. You should notify the court, the bank, and the person or business that is garnishing your account immediately in writing, and seek help from a lawyer .

Student Loan Borrowers Share Concerning Stories About Industry Collecting on Discharged Debt

The United States Bankruptcy Code provides important relief for debt-burdened consumers who need a fresh start to get their finances in order. This protection is particularly important for consumers who have been burdened by decades-old student debt, many of whom may have been subject to predatory practices .

For too long, a myth has persisted that student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The myth is not true because, in fact, student loans can be discharged bankruptcy. We have seen the Department of Education take important steps  to ensure that bankruptcy relief is available to federal student loan borrowers. It is vital that private student loan borrowers also receive the relief the Bankruptcy Code provides —and that loan owners, lenders, servicers, and debt collectors honor that relief when a bankruptcy judge discharges a consumer’s debts.

Education Loans Can Be Discharged in Bankruptcy

What is behind the perception that student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy? It is true that it can be more difficult to discharge many student loans than other types of unsecured debt; the Bankruptcy Code provides a more difficult test for relief (a showing of “undue hardship”) and an extra step in the process (an “adversary proceeding,” essentially a lawsuit within the bankruptcy). However, some borrowers may not realize that discharge is still possible even under that standard and extra step.

Importantly, some loans that borrowers may think of as “private student loans” are not subject to that standard and extra step. Instead, some private loans for educational purposes can be discharged in a normal bankruptcy proceeding, just like most other consumer debts.

For example, several types of loans associated with education expenses are dischargeable in bankruptcy, like most other types of unsecured consumer debt. These types of loans for education expenses are not subject to the more difficult standard and extra step. These loans could include, for example:

Loans where the loan amount was higher than the cost of attendance (such as tuition, books, room, and board), which can occur when a loan is paid directly to a consumer.
Loans to pay for education at places that are not eligible for Title IV funding such as unaccredited colleges, a school in a foreign country, or unaccredited training and trade certificate programs.
Loans made to cover fees and living expenses incurred while studying for the bar exam or other professional exams.
Loans made to cover fees, living expenses, and moving costs associated with medical or dental residency.
Loans to a student attending school less than half-time.
Troubling Consumer Accounts of Industry Practices Regarding Bankruptcy Discharges

While these details might be understandably difficult for the typical consumer to follow, they should be understood and reflected in the policies and procedures of loan owners, lenders, servicers, and collectors. As the CFPB has documented for years, student loan borrowers rely on their servicers  to provide timely and accurate information about their loans, including the protections the law provides when borrowers have trouble paying their loans. Unfortunately, the CFPB’s work has also  shown  how  student loan companies fail to consistently give borrowers the information and support they need.

Regrettably, complaints submitted to the CFPB suggest that some of these companies might be making false statements to borrowers about the protections bankruptcy offers—or worse, even collecting on debts that have already been discharged by a bankruptcy judge.

Complaints That Discharge Orders Are Being Violated

Consumer complaints raise serious questions about whether student loan companies are violating discharge orders—meaning they’re unlawfully collecting on loans even after a borrower has been through bankruptcy.

One consumer shared:

I have argued numerous times that [Direct to Consumer XYZ] loan was discharged as part of my … chapter 7 bankruptcy (see attached). They have collected monthly payments since then as part of the “charge off,” they have been reporting my account as late each month since then to the various credit agencies even though I’ve been paying their “agreed upon” monthly payments. As per a number of recent cases, it has been determined that in fact the [Direct to Consumer XYZ] loans were dischargeable.

Another consumer wrote:

There are two student loans that I took out with [Bank] while I was in college from 2006 to 2010. . . . The [Bank] student loans were discharged in Bankruptcy …. I have attached the discharge papers and highlighted the two [other Company] loans as well as the courts sentence stating that the unpaid amounts have been discharged. These are non-qualified private student loans, so they are not exempt from discharge under the bankruptcy code. They were taken out as direct consumer student loans, not certified by the school, and they were in excess of my scholarship and the federal student loans that covered by tuition. No further petition needs to be filed with the court for the discharge, according to the bankruptcy code any non-qualified private student loans are automatically discharged. I've told [other Company] this multiple times, but they just say that student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, which is only accurate for federal and private qualified student loans.

Another consumer wrote:

I filed for a chapter 7 which was [discharged] satisfactory .... My chapter 13 was [discharged] satisfactory this year .... I had a [Direct to Consumer XYZ] loan in 2007 which has been in derogatory status for a few months prior to my chapter 13 filing. . . . [S]omething told me to research the loan that I had. I took out what was called “[Direct to Consumer ABC] loan” which is considered a non traditional student loan. This was a loan they offered for students only which was sent directly to the student to do basically whatever they wanted. Which I took advantage of to help with bills and whatnot as being a young single parent full time student part time job.
After doing my research, I found out on several different platforms from back google searches that [Direct to Consumer XYZ] loans are NOT student loans and are FULLY discharged debts in bankruptcy. My immediate thought is that this should have been resolved when my chapter 7 was completed. They were included in my chapter 13 and received a payment. Now that my chapter 13 is complete, they have went back to reporting my account as derogatory, charged off and my account is still headed for collections. I have provided them the info, and they refuse to budge.

Student loan companies cannot collect debts that a consumer no longer owes. As noted above, certain types of education loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy without the higher standard and without the filing of an adversary proceeding. Collecting on debts that have been discharged through bankruptcy might not only violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices—it could also violate the order of a United States bankruptcy judge.

These complaints raise serious concerns about the practices of private student loan owners, lenders, servicers, and collectors and their handling of bankruptcy discharges.

Has Your Loan Been Discharged?

If you have been through bankruptcy and have private student loan debt that is still being collected, consider the following questions:

Did you take out the loan for educational expenses solely for the cost of attendance (tuition, books, room, and board) or did you take out a loan that was higher than the costs of attendance? If your loan was greater than cost of attendance, your loan might have been discharged.
Did you take out the loan to pay for education at an unaccredited school, a school in a foreign country, or unaccredited training and trade certificate programs? If so, your loan might have been discharged.
Did you take out the loan for fees or expenses related to studying for a professional exam? Or the cost of the board examination or fees, moving, and living expenses for a medical or dental residency? If so, your loan might have been discharged.
When you took out the loan, were you in school less than half-time? If so, your loan might have been discharged.

If you think you have been billed for a loan that has been discharged in bankruptcy, consider the following steps:

Document the bills you have received and how much you have paid since the bankruptcy discharge.
Locate and save any documents you have pertaining to the loan, like your promissory note and any other communications from the loan originator or servicer, as well as relevant bankruptcy documents listing the debt and the discharge order.
You can also submit a complaint to the CFPB and can attach information about your loan that supports your complaint.
