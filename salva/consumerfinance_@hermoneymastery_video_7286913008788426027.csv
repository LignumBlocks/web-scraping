Insufficient data protection or security for sensitive consumer information
Question presented

Can entities violate the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) when they have insufficient data protection or information security?

Summary answer

Yes. In addition to other federal laws governing data security for financial institutions, including the Safeguards Rules issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), “covered persons” and “service providers” must comply with the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the CFPA. Inadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by the company can constitute an unfair practice in violation of 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B). While these requirements often overlap, they are not coextensive.

Acts or practices are unfair when they cause or are likely to cause substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate authentication, password management, or software update policies or practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and financial institutions are unlikely to successfully justify weak data security practices based on countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate data security can be an unfair practice in the absence of a breach or intrusion.

Analysis

Widespread data breaches and cyberattacks have resulted in significant harms to consumers, including monetary loss, identity theft, significant time and money spent dealing with the impacts of the breach, and other forms of financial distress. Providers of consumer financial services are subject to specific requirements to protect consumer data. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) updated its Safeguards Rule implementing Section 501(b) of GLBA, to set forth specific criteria relating to the safeguards that certain nonbank financial institutions must implement as a part of their information security programs.1 These safeguards, among other things, limit who can access customer information, require the use of encryption to secure such information, and require the designation of a single qualified individual to oversee an institution’s information security program and report at least annually to the institution’s board of directors or equivalent governing body. The federal banking agencies also have issued interagency guidelines to implement Section 501 of GLBA.2

In certain circumstances, failure to comply with these specific requirements may also violate the CFPA’s prohibition on unfair acts or practices. The CFPA defines an unfair act or practice as an act or practice: (1) that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, (2) which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and (3) is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.3

A practice causes substantial injury to consumers when it causes significant harm to a few consumers or a small amount of harm to many consumers. For example, inadequate data security measures can cause significant harm to a few consumers who become victims of targeted identity theft as a result, or it can cause harm to potentially millions of consumers when there are large customer-base-wide data breaches. Information security weaknesses can result in data breaches, cyberattacks, exploits, ransomware attacks, and other exposure of consumer data.4

Further, actual injury is not required to satisfy this prong in every case. A significant risk of harm is also sufficient. In other words, this prong of unfairness is met even in the absence of a data breach. Practices that “are likely to cause” substantial injury, including inadequate data security measures that have not yet resulted in a breach, nonetheless satisfy this prong of unfairness.5

Consumers cannot reasonably avoid the harms caused by a firm’s data security failures. They typically have no way of knowing whether appropriate security measures are properly implemented, irrespective of disclosures provided. They do not control the creation or implementation of an entity’s security measures, including an entity’s information security program. And consumers lack the practical means to reasonably avoid harms resulting from data security failures.6

Where companies forgo reasonable cost-efficient measures to protect consumer data, like those measures identified below, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) expects the risk of substantial injury to consumers will outweigh any purported countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. The CFPB is unaware of any instance in which a court applying an unfairness standard has found that the substantial injury caused or likely to have been caused by a company’s poor data security practices was outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.7 Given the harms to consumers from breaches involving sensitive financial information, this is not surprising.

Relevant Precedent

On July 22, 2019, the CFPB alleged that Equifax violated the CFPA’s prohibition on unfair acts or practices.8 The FTC also alleged that Equifax violated the FTC Act and the FTC’s Safeguards Rule, which implements Section 501 of GLBA and establishes certain requirements that nonbank financial institutions must adhere to in order to protect financial information.9

In its complaint against Equifax, the CFPB alleged an unfairness violation based on Equifax’s failure to provide reasonable security for sensitive personal information it collected, processed, maintained, or stored within computer networks.10 In particular, Equifax violated the prohibition on unfairness (as well as the FTC’s Safeguards Rule) by using software that contained a known vulnerability and failing to patch the vulnerability for more than four months. Hackers exploited the vulnerability to steal over 140 million names, dates of birth, and SSNs, as well as millions of telephone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses, and hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers and expiration dates.11

Before the Equifax matter, law enforcement actions related to inadequate authentication triggered liability under the FTC Act’s prohibition on unfair practices. In 2006, the FTC sued online check processor Qchex and related entities for violating the FTC Act. The FTC alleged that it was an unfair practice to create and deliver checks without verifying that the person requesting the check was authorized to draw checks on the associated bank account.12 Qchex created checks “even when the customer’s name differed from the name on the bank account listed on the checks or from the name on the credit card account the customer used to pay for [Qchex’s] services.”13

Even after setting up certain identity verification procedures, Qchex bypassed those procedures for some customers.14 Ultimately, a court observed, “it was a simple matter for unscrupulous opportunists to obtain identity information and draw checks from accounts that were not their own.”15 That court confirmed that Qchex injured consumers by creating and delivering unverified checks, in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.16 Implementation of common-sense practices—including those that are now required under the FTC’s Safeguards Rule—protects consumers from injury and that, in turn, mitigates potential liability for businesses.

Liability for unfair acts or practices has also been triggered in the context of password management and routine software updates. In 2012, the FTC sued multiple entities associated with the Wyndham hospitality company for their failures “to employ reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information against unauthorized access” in violation of the FTC Act’s prohibitions on deceptive and unfair acts and practices.17 The inadequate data security practices included “using outdated operating systems that could not receive security updates or patches to address known security vulnerabilities,” servers that used “well-known default user IDs and passwords…which were easily available to hackers through simple Internet searches,” and password management policies that did not require “the use of complex passwords for access to the Wyndham-branded hotels’ property management systems and allow[ing] the use of easily guessed passwords.”18

The FTC alleged that, due to these and other deficient security measures, “intruders were able to gain unauthorized access to [Wyndham’s] computer network…on three separate occasions” and retrieved “customers’ payment card account numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.”19 One such incident led to “the compromise of more than 500,000 payment card accounts, and the export of hundreds of thousands of consumers’ payment card account numbers to a domain registered in Russia.”20 When Wyndham argued that data security issues were outside the bounds of the FTC’s unfairness authority, the courts confirmed that “the FTC has authority to regulate cybersecurity under the unfairness prong of” Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and that regulated entities have adequate notice that cybersecurity issues could lead to violations of that provision.21

In March 2022, the FTC announced an administrative complaint and proposed consent orders against Residual Pumpkin Entity, LLC and PlanetArt, LLC, respectively the former and current operators of CafePress, a customized merchandise e-commerce platform.22 The FTC’s complaint documented several inadequate data security practices, including the failure to “implement patch management policies and procedures to ensure timely remediation of critical security vulnerabilities,” the failure to “establish or enforce rules sufficient to make user credentials (such as username and password) hard to guess,” the failure to disclose security incidents to relevant parties, and inadequate “measures to prevent account takeovers through password resets using data known to have been obtained by hackers.”23

While the prohibition on unfair practices is fact-specific, the experience of the agencies suggests that failure to implement common data security practices will significantly increase the likelihood that a firm may be violating the prohibition. In the examples below, the Circular describes conduct that will typically meet the first two elements of an unfairness claim (likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers), and thus increase the likelihood that an entity’s conduct triggers liability under the CFPA’s prohibition of unfair practices.

1. Multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security enhancement that requires multiple credentials (factors) before an account can be accessed.24 Factors fall into three categories: something you know, like a password; something you have, like a token; and something you are, like your fingerprint. A common MFA setup is supplying both a password and a temporary numeric code in order to log in. Another MFA factor is the use of hardware identification devices. MFA greatly increases the level of difficulty for adversaries to compromise enterprise user accounts, and thus gain access to sensitive customer data. MFA solutions that protect against credential phishing, such as those using the Web Authentication standard supported by web browsers, are especially important.

If a covered person or service provider does not require MFA for its employees or offer multi-factor authentication as an option for consumers accessing systems and accounts, or has not implemented a reasonably secure equivalent, it is unlikely that the entity could demonstrate that countervailing benefits to consumers or competition outweigh the potential harms, thus triggering liability.25

2. Password Management

Unauthorized use of passwords is a common data security issue. Username and password combinations can be sold on the dark web or posted for free on the internet, which can be used to access not just the accounts in question, but other accounts held by the consumer or employee.

If a covered person or service provider does not have adequate password management policies and practices, it is unlikely they would succeed in showing countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that outweigh the potential harms, thus triggering liability.26 This includes failing to have processes in place to monitor for breaches at other entities where employees may be re-using logins and passwords (including notifying users when a password reset is required as a result), and includes use of default enterprise logins or passwords.

3. Timely Software Updates

Software vendors regularly update software to address security vulnerabilities within a program or product. When patches are released, the public, including hackers, become aware of the prior vulnerabilities. Therefore, when companies use commonly available software, including open-source software and open-source libraries,27 and do not install a patch that has been released for that software or take other mitigating steps if patching is not possible, they neglect to fix a security vulnerability that has become widely known. As noted in the CFPB’s complaint against Equifax, Equifax’s 2017 failure to patch a known vulnerability resulted in hackers gaining access to Equifax’s systems that exposed the personal information of nearly 148 million consumers.28

If covered persons or service providers do not routinely update systems, software, and code (including those utilized by contractors) or fail to update them when notified of a critical vulnerability, it is unlikely they would succeed in showing countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that outweigh the potential harms, thus triggering liability. This includes not having asset inventories of which systems contain dependencies on certain software to make sure software is up to date and highlight needs for patches and updates. It also includes the use of versions of software that are no longer actively maintained by their vendors.

Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2023-02
Reopening deposit accounts that consumers previously closed
Question presented

After consumers have closed deposit accounts, if a financial institution unilaterally reopens those accounts to process a debit (i.e., withdrawal, ACH transaction, check) or deposit, can it constitute an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)?

Response

Yes. After consumers have closed deposit accounts, if a financial institution unilaterally reopens those accounts to process debits or deposits, it can constitute an unfair practice under the CFPA. This practice may impose substantial injury on consumers that that they cannot reasonably avoid and that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Background

Consumers may elect to close a deposit account for a variety of reasons. For example, after moving to a new area, a consumer may elect to use a new account that they opened with a different financial institution that has a branch close to their new home. A consumer also might close an account because they are not satisfied with the account for another reason, such as the imposition of fees or the adequacy of customer service.

The process of closing a deposit account often takes time and effort. For example, closing an account typically involves taking steps to bring the account balance to zero at closure. The financial institution typically returns any funds remaining in the account to the consumer at closure and the consumer typically must pay any negative balance at closure. Some institutions require customers to provide a certain period of notice (e.g., a week) prior to closing the account to provide time for the financial institution to process any pending debits or deposits. Deposit account agreements typically indicate that the financial institution may return any debits or deposits to the account that the financial institution receives after closure and faces no liability for failing to honor any debits or deposits received after closure.

Sometimes after a consumer completes all of the steps that the financial institution requires to initiate the process of closing a deposit account and the financial institution completes the request, the financial institution unilaterally reopens the closed account if the institution receives a debit or deposit to the closed account. Financial institutions sometimes reopen an account even if doing so would overdraw the account, causing the financial institution to impose overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. Financial institutions may also charge consumers account maintenance fees upon reopening, even if the consumers were not required to pay such fees prior to account closure (e.g., because the account previously qualified to have the fees waived).

In addition to subjecting consumers to fees, when a financial institution processes a credit through an account that has reopened, the consumer’s funds may become available to third parties, including third parties that do not have permission to access their funds.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has brought an enforcement action regarding the practice of account reopening under the CFPA’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.1 The CFPB found that a financial institution engaged in an unfair practice by reopening deposit accounts consumers had previously closed without seeking prior authorization or providing timely notice. This practice of reopening closed deposit accounts caused some account balances to become negative and potentially subjected consumers to various fees, including overdraft and NSF fees. In addition, when the financial institution reopened an account to process a deposit, creditors had the opportunity to initiate debits to the account and draw down the funds, possibly resulting in a negative balance and the accumulation of fees. These practices resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees charged to consumers. The CFPB concluded that the institution’s practice of reopening consumer accounts without obtaining consumers’ prior authorization and providing timely notice caused substantial injury to consumers that was not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by any countervailing benefit to consumers or to competition.

Analysis

A financial institution’s unilateral reopening of deposit accounts that consumers previously closed can constitute a violation of the CFPA’s probation on unfair acts or practices.2

Under the CFPA, an act or practice is unfair when it causes or is likely to cause consumers substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers and the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.3

Unilaterally reopening a closed deposit account to process a debit or deposit may cause substantial injury to consumers.

Substantial injury includes monetary harm, such as fees paid by consumers due to the unfair practice. Actual injury is not required; significant risk of concrete harm is sufficient.4 Substantial injury can occur when a small amount of harm is imposed on a significant number of consumers.5

After a consumer has closed a deposit account, a financial institution’s act of unilaterally reopening that account upon receiving a debit or deposit may cause monetary harm to the consumer. Financial institutions frequently charge fees after they reopen an account. For example, consumers may incur penalty fees6 when an account that they closed is reopened by the financial institution after receiving a debit or deposit. Since financial institutions typically require a zero balance to close an account, reopening a closed account to process a debit is likely to result in consumers incurring penalty fees.

In addition to fees, reopening a consumer’s account to accept a deposit increases the risk that an unauthorized third party may gain access to the consumer’s funds (e.g., a person with the consumer’s account information who pulls funds from the account without the consumer’s authorization).

And if reopening the account overdraws the account and the consumer does not repay the amount owed quickly, the financial institution may furnish negative information to consumer reporting companies, which may make it harder for the consumer to obtain a deposit account in the future. Because reopening accounts that the consumer closed gives rise to these risks of monetary harm, this practice may cause substantial injury.

Consumers likely cannot reasonably avoid this injury.

An injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers when consumers cannot make informed decisions or take action to avoid that injury. Injury that occurs without a consumer’s knowledge or consent, when consumers cannot reasonably anticipate the injury, or when there is no way to avoid the injury even if anticipated, is not reasonably avoidable.7

Consumers often cannot reasonably avoid the risk of substantial injury caused by financial institutions’ practice of unilaterally reopening accounts that consumers previously closed because they cannot control one or more of the following circumstances: a third party’s attempt to debit or deposit money, the process and timing of account closure, or the terms of the deposit account agreements.

First, without the consumer’s consent or knowledge, a third party may attempt to debit from or deposit to the closed account, prompting their previous financial institution to reopen the account. For example, a payroll provider may inadvertently send a consumer’s paycheck to the closed account, even if the consumer informed the payroll provider about the account closure and directed them to deposit their paycheck in a new account. Similarly, a merchant may take an extended amount of time to process a refund to a customer’s account for a returned item or may use the wrong account information to process a recurring monthly payment. Consumers cannot reasonably avoid these types of injuries resulting from these types of actions by a third party.

Second, financial institutions may require consumers to complete a multi-step process before closing a deposit account, which can involve completing paperwork in person, returning or destroying any access devices, bringing the balance to zero, and fulfilling waiting periods. When consumers begin this process, they likely will not know exactly when the financial institution will fulfill their request to close the account. Consumers, for example, do not control waiting periods or the length of time it takes a financial institution to settle transactions to bring a balance to zero. Consumers’ lack of control over the financial institution’s account closure process and timeline may make it more difficult for them to prevent debits and credits that will reopen the account, since the account may close earlier than they expect.

Finally, consumers may not have a reasonable alternative to financial institutions that permit this practice because most deposit contracts either permit or are silent on this practice. Further, to the extent that deposit account agreements allow or disclose such practices, these agreements typically are standard-form contracts prepared by financial institutions that specify a fixed set of terms.8 Consumers have no ability to negotiate the terms of these agreements. Instead, financial institutions present these contracts to consumers on a take-or-leave-it basis. Thus, even if deposit account agreements reference this practice, consumers also have limited ability to negotiate the terms of such contracts, and consumers can incur injuries in circumstances beyond their control. Moreover, even if the financial institution informs the consumer at the time that the account is closed that the institution may reopen the account, pursuant to the account agreement, the consumer will still generally lack the practical ability to control whether the account will be reopened and to avoid fees and other monetary harms.

This injury is likely not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Reopening a closed account does not appear to provide any meaningful benefits to consumers or competition. To the extent financial institutions are concerned about controlling their own costs to remain competitive, they have alternatives to reopening a closed account upon receiving a debit or deposit that could minimize their expenses and liability. For example, the financial institution could decline any transactions that they receive for accounts consumers previously closed. In addition to minimizing the institution’s costs, not reopening these accounts may protect the financial institution against the use of closed accounts to commit fraud.

Moreover, consumers do not generally benefit when a financial institution unilaterally reopens an account that consumers previously closed. Since financial institutions typically require consumers to bring the account balance to zero before closing an account, reopening an account in response to a debit will likely result in penalty fees rather than payment of an amount owed by the consumer. While consumers might potentially benefit in some instances where their accounts are reopened to receive deposits, which then become available to them, that benefit does not outweigh the injuries that can be caused by unilateral account reopening. Such benefits are unlikely to be significant because consumers can generally receive the same deposits in another way that they would prefer (such as through a new account that they opened to replace the closed account). And those uncertain benefits are outweighed by the risk that deposited funds will be depleted before the consumer can access (or is even aware of) the funds (e.g., through maintenance or other fees assessed by the financial institution as a result of the reopening or debits from the reopened account by third parties).

Further, not reopening accounts may benefit consumers in certain circumstances. For example, declining a deposit submitted to a closed account alerts the fund’s sender that they have incorrect account information and may encourage the sender to contact the consumer to obtain updated account information. Declining a debit also provides an opportunity for the sender of the debit to inform the consumer of any erroneous account information, providing the consumer with the opportunity to make the payment with a current account or through another process.

For these reasons, government enforcers should consider whether a financial institution has violated the prohibition against unfair acts or practices in the CFPA if they discover that a financial institution has unilaterally reopened accounts that consumers previously closed.

Banking in video games and virtual worlds
APR 04, 2024
Executive summary

As video games and virtual worlds have become more and more popular, gaming assets have become increasingly valuable. Gaming assets are stored on a player’s accounts and used as a medium of exchange for all sorts of transactions within these worlds, including the purchase of goods and services and person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers.

Banking and payment services that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets generally provide consumer protections, including recourse after unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds typically emphasize a “buyer beware” approach. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring markets—regardless of the infrastructure used—where financial products and services may be offered, including video games and virtual worlds.

Key findings
Gaming assets flow in and out of gaming marketplaces in a variety of ways and can have immense value. To leverage that value, financial products and services have begun entering gaming in the form of payment processing, money transmission, and even loans.
With the rise in value of gaming assets, there have also been increased reports of users losing access to gaming assets through hacking attempts, account theft, scams, and unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to traditional banking and payment systems.
Gaming publishers can collect a host of surveillance data about their users. This includes location data, social media data, and behavioral interactions, such as how a player responds to personalized incentives. There is risk that gamers may be harmed when their data is sold, bought, and traded between companies, including for purposes outside of game play.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, U.S. marketplaces have seen a shift from traditional brick-and-mortar commerce to online marketplaces. Consumers increasingly conduct commercial activity online, typically relying on the infrastructure developed by banks and payment systems using fiat currency. For instance, consumers today primarily use debit or credit cards or other similar methods when conducting online transactions. Virtual currencies are steadily becoming an important part of the online commerce ecosystem. One prominent example of this trend is transactions that occur in games and virtual worlds.

Billions of U.S. dollars (USD) are spent each year in gaming and virtual worlds, where consumers buy gaming assets1 using fiat currency and then use those assets to make purchases in-game. Some games also allow consumers to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency. These marketplaces and the infrastructure that supports them increasingly resemble traditional banking and payments systems. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to banking and payment systems.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring non-traditional markets where financial products and services may be offered, including the use of virtual currencies in games and virtual worlds. This report examines:

The evolution of the gaming industry and the revenue shift from one-time purchases of games to smaller payments made during game play.
The systems that enable fiat currency to flow into and out of games and virtual worlds and make it possible to assign and extract considerable value from gaming assets both inside and outside of the game.
How video games and virtual worlds act as electronic platforms that enable players to store and transfer valuable assets.
Recent activity by companies to leverage gaming assets and their value by providing services that increasingly resemble traditional financial products, like loans and proprietary payment systems.

The CFPB is also monitoring a number of concerning issues regarding gaming markets. These issues include, for instance, the recourse (or lack thereof) for players who incur financial losses due to theft, scams, or other criminal activity. Other issues include the proliferation of both fraud and money laundering facilitated by the two-way flow of money on these platforms, as well as the ability of gaming companies to collect an immense amount of sensitive consumer data, including data that is not only used to enhance game play but also to manipulate prices and monetize gaming in other ways. Ultimately, this activity raises questions about gaming companies’ compliance with applicable law, including federal consumer financial protection laws.2

The ability to leverage, store, and transfer valuable assets within gaming markets and the collection and use of player data to inform that market may create significant risks to consumers, especially young consumers. The CFPB expects that emerging trends in the gaming market, as detailed in this issue spotlight, will be of interest to policymakers and other government agencies with responsibilities related to the issues uncovered.

The gaming industry

The gaming industry has evolved rapidly, and gaming assets, such as in-game currency and virtual items, have become increasingly valuable alongside that evolution. Beginning in arcades, gaming originally relied on a one-time payment model, where players would pay a few cents for the opportunity to collect “power pellets” or purses. The industry soon shifted to home computers and consoles, where players would pay a fixed, up-front cost to play a game from beginning to end, collecting gold coins or “power-ups” along the way. Today, game revenue is no longer based solely on such one-time purchases. The highest revenue-generating games mostly profit through small, one-off payments known as microtransactions that are made throughout the lifetime of a game.3 The industry continues to trend in this direction, with many games changing to a free-to-play monetization model.4

Moreover, gaming is no longer constrained to just playing with people in the same room as you. Online gaming has made it possible for players to join virtual worlds with millions of other players. These types of games can include massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) games like World of Warcraft, Runescape, and Final Fantasy, which usually involve players working together to accomplish a specific goal and collect objects, experiences, or territories. There are also platforms like Second Life, Roblox, and Fortnite that offer immersive, community driven, free-form virtual worlds.5 Recent market trends, including the development of augmented, virtual, and mixed-reality headsets—also known as AR/VR/MR headsets—point towards shifts that continue to blur the boundaries between the offline world and immersive, virtual worlds.6

For most of these games, a key part of game play is having an asset, item, or currency and using that currency to buy virtual items and services within the game. For virtual worlds, items purchased are typically cosmetic in nature and used to individualize players’ avatars. Players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. Most of these games have in-game marketplaces where assets can be bought, sold, or traded. As a result, gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial payments.7

Market participants

Recent estimates value the global gaming industry at $249.55 billion in 2022.8 Global revenue for video games is expected to reach $321.1 billion by 2026.9

The gaming industry consists of many large, established companies such as Microsoft (including Activision Blizzard), Sony, Valve (Steam), Epic Games, Roblox, and Electronic Arts. Collectively, these companies earn billions in global revenues.10 The largest gaming companies typically own blockbuster games or popular virtual world platforms. For instance,

In 2023, Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard—creator of popular games such as World of Warcraft—for $75.4 billion.11 In January 2024, Microsoft announced it made $7.11 billion from gaming that quarter, exceeding earnings from flagship products like Windows.12
In December 2023, the immersive, virtual world platform Roblox averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally.13 That year, the company made approximately $2.8 billion in revenue.14

Some of the most successful gaming companies have increasingly sought to provide players with a “one-stop shop” experience that integrates playing, distributing, and storing games, as well as game assets, in one place. For example,

Valve owns Steam, a digital distribution service and storefront where players can play and buy games, as well as trade gaming assets for additional fees.15
Sony originally joined the gaming industry as a console manufacturer in partnership with Nintendo. However, in 1994, Sony developed the PlayStation, the first gaming console that used CDs instead of cartridges. Sony’s console continued to evolve over the years adding a digital media entertainment service and virtual marketplace, allowing players to purchase and store games.16 Recently, Sony changed its PlayStation store model to prevent digital download codes from other retailers, making it the sole digital game distributor for owners of its console.17

Games backed by large companies are so influential that some industry observers have suggested the odds of lower budget games breaking through in the market are shrinking.18 At the same time, large technology companies, with their vast resources, have been increasing their footprint in this space. For example:

In 2014, Amazon acquired the market’s leading video game livestreaming service Twitch.19
The U.S. AR/VR/MR market size was valued at $4.39 billion in 202020 and large technology companies have bet big on creating games and headsets to fit this technology.
Meta released its Meta Quest headset and VR game, Horizon Worlds, in 2018 and then subsequently invested $15.9 billion in the technology.21
Meanwhile, Apple launched its Vision Pro headset, which advertises the ability to “transport users to stunning game play environments and exciting new places” in 2024.22 Apple’s headset also integrates Apple’s phone payment system with features like sending and requesting money through Apple Pay,23 and facilitating online shopping.24
Gamers in the U.S.

American consumers spent $56.6 billion on gaming in 2022, including hardware and content, like game purchases and microtransactions. According to research, the typical gamer skews slightly male,25 even though the number of female gamers has been steadily increasing recently.26 Research has shown that players typically average 12.8 hours a week gaming across multiple platforms and most often play video games on their phones, gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops.27

For many young people today, gaming may be their introduction to financial activity. For example, gaming provides young people the opportunity to learn about earning currency, managing assets, and making purchases.28 Gaming companies may view young players as an opportunity to create lifelong consumers early. An estimated 76 percent of children in the United States play video games.29 The most popular virtual platform among young people in the U.S. is Roblox,30 which, as previously mentioned, averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally in December 202331 and roughly 58 percent of those users were under the age of 16.32 Its popularity is largely due to the ease in which players “can invite friends to join…different virtual worlds or games” on the platform.""33 Research has shown that today’s young people primarily turn to video games and virtual worlds to socialize with friends, rather than the draw of playing a game.34 Harnessing the appeal of socialization, technology and gaming companies have expressed their intention to market VR headsets—and as a result community driven, free-form virtual worlds—to children as young as 10 years old.35

Young people may be especially vulnerable to tactics used by gaming companies to induce spending and monetize gaming, as their financial habits are still forming.36 In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised concerns about loot boxes,37 including the effectiveness of disclosures prior to purchase, the design of loot boxes promoting compulsive spending, and potential risks to young players. The FTC also noted that the gaming industry has taken steps to self-regulate loot boxes.38 Nonetheless, in 2022, a study found that American youths’ consumption of loot boxes is on the rise39 and additional research suggests that loot box usage by children or teens can potentially lead to problems with gambling later in life.40 Internationally, regulatory efforts have focused on disclosing the odds of loot box rewards and including 'gambling-like mechanisms' in age-rating decisions.41 Within the U.S., efforts have been mostly focused on industry-wide self-regulation rather than specific policy interventions.42

Monetizing player data

While playing games, companies collect a great deal of data and information on the player. The collection of this data is often marketed as beneficial to the player and their game play, as it can be used to provide a unique and personalized experience.43 However, this data can be used to monetize game play in a manner that may take advantage of players’ proclivities to entice more spending.44 This data is also often sold, bought, and traded between companies.45

Types of data collected

As players move through a game, game publishers track their behavior. This behavior can include financial data like purchasing history, spending thresholds, and how a player responds to personalized incentives like dynamic price updates. It also includes non-financial data, like how players interact with characters and the amount of time spent on tasks.46

The technology used to operate mobile games or render virtual or mixed-reality environments collects an immense amount of sensitive player data. Gaming consoles, mobile phone gaming applications, and gaming platforms often track lifestyle and behavioral measurements like location data and interactions with games and devices,47 as well as details obtained through integrations with social media platforms.48 Viewed as a whole, this data can be used to generate an accurate portrait of a player’s offline identity, including their daily routines, home address, places of employment or worship, and who they connect with while playing.49

Similarly, AR/VR/MR headsets track a player’s movements and physical behavior to render a VR scene used to interact with virtual environments. This data includes biometric data such as posture, eye gaze, gestures, facial expressions, voice, heart rate, and interpersonal distance. Eye movement, pupil response, and gait analysis are considered especially sensitive.50 Researchers have associated eye-movement tracking with ADHD symptoms51 and Alzheimer’s,52 and this data collection poses medical privacy risks for that reason. The headsets generally also use audio, visual, and inertial sensors to detect the position and movement of a user or device relative to its surroundings. These sensors collect information about the user’s physical location, including the size of the room they are in and data on passive bystanders that happen to be within range.53

How gaming companies make money on player data
Microtransactions and discriminatory pricing

Optimizing game play based on player data is commonly referred to by industry experts as “dynamic odds.”54 Gaming companies have been using behavioral, biometric, and personal data to manipulate prices and the availability of goods or services on a highly individualized level.55

For example, if player data shows that a player is unlikely to spend money on microtransactions, their odds of earning—rather than buying—rare assets will increase. This practice helps advertise rare assets to players that do spend money. Where data shows that a player is willing to participate in microtransactions or pay more money to keep playing the game, the game will increase their prices and decrease their chances of earning rare assets.56

While some gaming terms of service state that prices of in-game items may be determined by factors that are not disclosed to the player—such as an algorithm that considers the player's available funds and cost sensitivity—the availability, value, and quality of goods, including those in the user's account, may change at any time.57

“Dynamic odds” impact the perceived value of gaming assets when their availability, price, and/or scarcity within the game is individualized and therefore the real value is obscured from the player. This use of data gives a misleading impression to the player about the fairness or neutrality of these opportunities.

Advertising

In addition to microtransactions, players often pay with their time and attention. The gaming industry uses player data and algorithms marketed as artificial intelligence or “AI” to target ads to specific audiences, making them more effective for advertisers and profitable for game publishers.58 For example, games can combine individual player location data, as well as data like birth date, age group, and gender with statistical location-based demographic data to provide advertisers with an array of audience targeting options including age, gender, family, and economic status.59 Game publishers can also use player behavior to make targeted ads more effective. For example, games can present non-skippable ads at certain intervals within the game when a player is highly motivated to continue playing. Sometimes, the player can pay to get rid of these ads. Other times, the player will have to watch the ad to keep playing or get a reward like in-game currency.60

Ultimately, this vast accumulation of data from consumers raises questions as to whether proper privacy regulations are being adhered to and whether consumers are fully aware of how their data is being used by gaming companies and across the industry. Without the right privacy protections, the data collected from gaming and AR/VR/MR headsets may be used to inform predictive models, including those marketed as artificial intelligence, and to adjust prices and game play or drive revenue growth.61

Examining the value of gaming assets

Gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial activities. In-game currencies can act as mediums of exchange that players can use for all sorts of in-game transactions, such as person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers or buying and selling in-game goods and services. These assets may be “treasure keys,” or “gold pieces,” instead of USD, but their use is functionally the same. And like the offline world, game economies experience supply, demand, and fluctuating prices.

Many gaming companies view their assets as virtual, licensed content or a preloaded currency that can only be used in their proprietary virtual world. Many gaming companies also claim that their gaming assets have no monetary value, are irredeemable for fiat currency62 and that their environments function as closed markets. However, these markets can actually be quite porous and gaming assets can have considerable value, including outside of the game itself.

This is largely due to the two-way flow of money that makes it possible to assign and extract monetary value from gaming assets. Several games provide on-ramps of fiat currency into their systems by allowing gaming assets to be purchased with USD. And, although they’re not the majority, some prominent games allow players to extract fiat currency (“cash-out”) directly from their platform63 or enable third-party systems that facilitate a cash-out process.64 Most games do not currently enable a cash-out process themselves, but third-party systems have emerged to facilitate the conversion of some gaming assets to fiat currency through various means.65 The estimated value of these assets is even tracked on public websites that show the current exchange rate of various gaming currencies to USD.66

In-game and virtual currencies

In some of the most popular video games today, players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. In-game currency is then used to buy goods and services as a part of game play, including virtual items.67 Game publishers determine the conversion rate of fiat currency to in-game currencies and the prices of virtual items, as well as the supply.68 Figure 1 below shows the various cash-in and cash-out relationships of gaming and virtual world markets.

Figure 1: The possible flow of fiat currency in individual gaming markets69

Second Life, a large and popular online virtual world70 owned by Linden Lab that was released in 2003, is an example of a game with both on and off-ramps to convert fiat currency. In Second Life, “Residents” use the Linden Dollar (L$), which can be purchased both in-world and from Second Life’s official Linden Exchange (LindeX) using fiat currency. Linden dollars act as money, as the player can use it to buy and sell virtual items, tip, or pay other Residents,71 and buy original services.72 All Second Life accounts have both a Linden Dollar balance and a USD balance, and players can convert Linden Dollars back to USD by selling Linden Dollars on the Linden Exchange. The USD account balance can be withdrawn or used to pay for Second Life services like subscriptions or fees. The USD account balance is managed by Tilia, a licensed money transmitter and subsidiary of Linden Lab. The USD account balance can be withdrawn using PayPal or Skrill. During withdrawal, a 5-percent fee is taken from the transaction total and the first withdrawal typically takes about 30 days.73 Between 2011 and 2013, third-party websites allowed trading between Linden dollars and Bitcoin.74 In 2021, Second Life reported the average number of daily users to be 200,000 users across 200 countries and a GDP equivalent of over $600 million,75 more than some small countries.76

On the other hand, League of Legends is an example of a game that does not allow players to cash-out within the game, but third-party systems exist that enable the exchange of its in-game currency for fiat currency. The game has two main currencies: Blue Essence (BE), which has no cash-in or cash-out process, and Riot Points (RP), which is exclusively obtained for purchase via fiat currency. Riot Points are used in the in-game market to purchase various virtual items that work across all games made by Riot Games.77 League of Legends does not allow Riot Points to be cashed-out within the game, but third-party systems enable the exchange of Riot Points for fiat currency.78

Virtual items, such as skins or cosmetic items

Virtual items, such as “skins”,79 are usually ornamental or cosmetic goods that have no impact on game play but have become a token of status and in some instances are considered immensely valuable by players.80 In general, virtual items are typically acquired through one of the following ways:

Earned as a reward in game play.
Bought with USD or in-game currency as a microtransaction.
Bought, sold, or traded through in-game, secondary, or third-party markets for fiat currency, other virtual items, or in-game currency.
Won in a “random chance” loot box.

Importantly, virtual items can sometimes be traded between players as an acceptable form of payment.81 For example, in the virtual world of Habbo Hotel, items are exchanged between players through the in-game market. Plastic chairs were originally designed to furnish virtual apartments. Over time, these chairs gradually became the currency of the game. Prices on the market would be denominated in plastic chairs, and the exchange of plastic chairs would allow players to buy goods or services within the game.82

Notably, the value of these skins or cosmetic items can be converted into fiat currency and certain skins reach surprisingly high value in virtual markets that allow P2P trading. The Steam Community Market is a platform-supported secondary market where players go to buy, trade, and sell items outside of individual games. Within the individual games, skins only have cosmetic use value, but on the Steam Community Market, these assets have “exchange value,”83 meaning skins can be bought, sold, or traded among players for Steam Wallet funds or other skins.84 This value can be so great that, in Steam’s terms and conditions, they even acknowledge that proceeds from these sales or trades may be considered as taxable income to players and thereby subject to applicable laws.85

Although, the Steam Community Market does not directly facilitate a cash-out process to withdraw Steam wallet funds for fiat currency,86 there is an entire ecosystem of third-party markets that are enabled by Steam’s application programming interface (API).87 These sites facilitate player-to-player trading and converting skins to crypto-assets or fiat currency, leading to even higher exchange values for some individual skins on these third-party markets, as well as the Steam Community Market.88 For example, the largest sale of a Counter-Strike skin occurred in 2023 on a third-party website for over $500,000.89

Third-party websites also facilitate a growing skin gambling industry that supports wagering skins, similar to casino chips, in virtual games such as blackjack, roulette, or craps.90 For example, a player’s account balance can be made up of skins, conventional currency, and other forms of virtual currency that are then converted to that site’s form of credit.91 Skins are then won or lost depending on the outcomes of the games.92 Third-party websites also facilitate skin betting on events like competitive gaming contests, also known as esports,93 and games between professional sports teams.94 Winnings can be converted to fiat currency or other forms of virtual currency and withdrawn for a fee directly to the player’s digital wallet.95

Third-party systems convert gaming assets to USD

Many third-party systems facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of in-game currency, virtual items, and even entire player accounts. However, third-party systems do not need to be enabled by a company’s API to convert gaming assets back to conventional currency and at the time of this report, many games make it impossible to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency without using a third-party market or website.96 For example, third-party sites support the selling of game currencies for USD from games where an API doesn’t exist like RuneScape, World of Warcraft, and others.97

To convert gaming assets these sites first connect interested buyers with sellers so they can then exchange assets within the game. The buyer then pays the seller through the third-party website and the seller can withdraw that payment in their preferred fiat currency directly to a bank account or digital wallet for a fee. Because these sites facilitate the transaction, players are able to exchange gaming assets for fiat currency.98

Figure 2: Markets available outside individual games
Crypto-asset related virtual worlds

Though their usage remains sparse, a number of virtual worlds and games exist that utilize crypto-assets—such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—as virtual items, or crypto-assets as game currency.99 The relationship between these virtual worlds and their official crypto-assets is similar to video games and their in-game currencies. Players purchase the virtual world’s native asset and use it to buy goods and services within that virtual world’s economy.

While these crypto-asset virtual worlds are significantly less popular than virtual gaming worlds like Roblox, Second Life, or Fortnite,100 they are important to note because of the prevalence of third-party crypto-asset trading platforms, users can convert a virtual world’s native crypto-asset to fiat currency, making them even more porous than typical gaming markets. Notably, some of the largest virtual gaming world publishers have expressed growing interest in positioning their virtual items as crypto-assets that have the ability to be traded outside of the game’s economy.101

Examples of these crypto-asset related virtual worlds include Decentraland, which uses a crypto-asset called MANA, and The Sandbox, which uses a crypto-asset called SAND.102 Both of these in-game crypto-assets can be used for transactions within their respective virtual worlds and can also be traded on other crypto-asset platforms for USD.103

In the game Axie Infinity, players interact virtually through digital pets called “Axies,” each of which is a non-fungible token (NFT) stored on the Ronin network. Users earn the crypto-asset Smooth Love Potion (SLP) by playing the game. Players can also “breed” new Axies by spending SLP and another crypto-asset token, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). Users can trade SLP and AXS for fiat currency or other crypto-assets on third party crypto-asset trading platforms.104 At the height of its success, Axie Infinity had over 2.7 million daily active users105 but as the number of users grew, the NFTs required to play became very expensive, leading to hierarchies of users: investors, managers, and workers.106 While the crypto-asset industry and its investors lauded the game as a viable way to earn income, reports documented the ways the gaming system exploited workers.107 The ecosystem largely fell apart in 2022 following a breach of the game by a state-sponsored hacking group.108

Conversion and purchase issues with in-game currency

Industry experts have expressed concern about the tactics game makers use to obscure the real costs of gaming assets from players.109 Games frequently use currency bundles110 to hide the true value of what players may purchase and to make larger quantities seem like the “better deal.” These pre-set bundles are often in large quantities (e.g., 100, 1,000, or 10,000 units) with confusing exchange rates (e.g. 2/3, 3/5, 5/7), rather than the exact amount needed for a particular in-game purchase or activity.

In some cases, games may also have more than one currency with different exchange rates for each currency, making the mental conversions between fiat currency and the game currency difficult. This often leads to large amounts of unused currency without any way to get it out of the game. Some players believe this is done by game makers to maximize profits as players are unable to track the exact amount of money spent but feel obligated to keep playing to avoid sunk costs.111

Converting game assets back to fiat currency within a game can lead to increased costs for players, for example, by using differing ratios for deposits and withdrawals or burdensome thresholds for withdrawal. For instance, the popular game Roblox allows players to create games and virtual worlds within Roblox’s gaming universe, as well as play games created by other users. As users move from game-to-game within Roblox, they can buy virtual items in exchange for Robux, the platform’s in-game currency. When a virtual item is bought within a game developed by a specific player, that player earns Robux. Roblox’s terms and conditions only allows players that are active creators112 to cash-out their earned Robux for fiat currency.113 Notably, while Roblox has separate ""User Terms"" and ""Creator Terms,"" everyone who joins Roblox’s must agree to both terms and conditions, essentially making all players also creators.114 To convert earned Robux115 to USD, an active creator must earn a minimum of 30,000 Robux. Additionally, Roblox’s conversion rate to USD is not intuitive. Buying 100,000 Robux through Roblox’s store costs $1,000, but withdrawing 100,000 of earned Robux only gets a player $350.116 Even with these constraints, Roblox players that are creators withdrew $740.8 million in 2023.117

Gaming platforms facilitate the P2P transfer of gaming assets

As previously mentioned, gaming assets are frequently exchanged or transferred among players through various means. These means can include gifting virtual items to other players, which is supported by games like Fortnite, Rocket League, and Minecraft.118 As well as, platform-supported secondary markets like the Steam Community Marketplace and in-game markets like RuneScape’s expansive transfer market, where individuals can trade valuable virtual items in their inventory and currency with other players.119 Gaming platforms and virtual worlds thus appear to function like payment systems by facilitating the storage and exchange of valuable assets.

Players have also found ways to recreate traditional P2P transfer activities within gaming markets that do not allow it. While Roblox expressly disallows person-to-person transfers of Robux,120 users facilitate the transfer process themselves by purchasing quickly developed items from an individual enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program, who may also be a player. The individual who receives Robux from the purchase of their item will receive 70 percent of the earned Robux. This effectively transfers Robux from one person (the buyer) to another (the seller).121 This also extends to collectives known as “Roblox Groups,” which include individuals that are enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program and who want to split Robux revenue. These earnings can then be transferred to USD through a one-time or recurring payment.122

The impact of gaming assets having monetary value

Video games and virtual worlds appear to be functioning more and more like banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. As gaming assets store greater amounts of value and their use becomes increasingly similar to that of money, the CFPB is monitoring how gaming assets are used and the associated risks, including those impacting children and the emergence of products or services that resemble traditional consumer financial products or services.

Accounts may be vulnerable to losses

When in-game currency or virtual items are earned during game play or procured via microtransactions, they are stored on a player’s account for future use. This use can include transactions within the game,123 trading virtual items with other players,124 buying products on platform-supported secondary markets,125 converting gaming assets to fiat currency,126 withdrawals as fiat currency,127 or using third-parties to convert and withdraw as fiat currency.128 As a result, a player’s account is considered highly valuable. In fact, several third-party systems facilitate the buying and selling of entire player accounts themselves, not just individual gaming assets.129

The practice of harvesting in-game currency for sale on a player account, also known as gold farming and the amount of potential earnings has drawn seasoned players to this practice as a source of income. However, as detailed below, gaming accounts often lack the security and protections of traditional bank accounts. Some of the most common scams include defrauding a player of the assets stored on their account, as well as hacking into their account and transferring in-game currency to another account.

Account vulnerabilities

The monetary value of player accounts combined with the ability to cash-out gaming assets has led to an influx of phishing attempts and reports of account theft. Attackers often use compromised user credentials to break into player accounts and access game currency or virtual items. They then use third-party systems to transfer gaming assets to another account or sell the assets for fiat currency.130 A recent study from 10,000 gamers globally showed that 63 percent of respondents feel their accounts aren't safe enough from attacks—with one in three reporting that their accounts had been hacked in the last two years.131 Industry experts consider young gamers especially at risk of phishing attempts due to their likely presence on social media and lack of awareness about social engineering tactics.132 Consumers are also potentially threatened by an emerging market of account recovery scammers that promote their ability to obtain lost gaming assets for victims of theft.133

Recourse when assets are lost

In complaints to the FTC and CFPB, several players reported hacking attempts, account theft, scams, unauthorized transactions, and losing access to game currencies and virtual items, but they received limited recourse from gaming companies. Gaming companies often take a “buyer beware” approach, putting the burden on individual players to avoid these scams and phishing attempts. They may lock or ban players’ accounts suspected of scamming and phishing but do little to provide remedy to the victim. For example, stolen items on Steam are not returned due in part to market incentives. Steam states that its virtual items' value is “at least partially determined by that item's scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy…the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.”134

Consumers have complained that some gaming companies will terminate the accounts of players for pursuing recourse from their financial institution for unauthorized game purchases. In their terms and conditions, Roblox requests users to “contact Roblox Support before disputing any charges directly with your payment processor.”135 The CFPB and FTC have received complaints from players who contacted their financial institutions regarding unauthorized Roblox game purchases. These complaints note that while they received refunds through their financial institutions, Roblox then terminated or locked their account.

When a player loses access to their account because they are accused of violating a game’s terms of service or a game is terminated altogether, the game publishers state that they have no obligation to compensate the players for their lost assets or return the money players have invested.136

Fraud in gaming markets

The ability to transfer and otherwise convert gaming assets to fiat currency or crypto-assets has led to a proliferation of money laundering137 and fraud138 on gaming platforms.

Researchers and academics have found that gaming markets can facilitate illegal money laundering.139 For example, a person can open different player accounts on several online gaming platforms, use those accounts to buy gaming assets with illegally obtained funds. They can then send the assets to other accounts within the game and then convert them to fiat currency using third-party markets. These practices enable ill-gotten funds to become less traceable with each step.140

Further, the conditions of gaming markets embolden activities such as fraudulent transactions and scams. In 2023, one firm estimated that it lost $110 million due to fraudulent transactions.141 The CFPB has received complaints regarding various trade scams on these third-party websites. In one complaint, a consumer reports that they purchased a gaming account from a prominent third-party website and confirmed receipt of the account. However, once receipt was confirmed, the account was hacked and recovered by the original owner. Per the third-party website’s terms and conditions, once receipt was confirmed, there was no available recourse for the buyer.142

Issues with third-party systems

The terms and conditions of these third-party websites can be misleading or otherwise obscure the truth about the risks involved in their services. For example, some third-party websites entice users with gaming assets, like discounted bundles of game currency or rare virtual items, in exchange for downloading applications, watching advertiser content, or submitting personal details.143 These tactics potentially expose players to risks like credit card fraud, malware, and identity theft. 144

Several of these third-party websites collect a large amount of personally identifiable information including email addresses, gaming usernames, and log data, such as IP addresses and browser information. They may also need banking information to process payments through services like Stripe and PayPal.145 Yet, these marketplaces have had a number of data breaches and hacks.146 These incidents have also occurred at large gaming companies, pointing to an industry-wide security issue.147 As these markets evolve, including functioning more and more like banking and payment systems, it is imperative that companies take appropriate data security steps.148

Gaming specific financial products

Leveraging the value of gaming assets and the amount of commerce occurring on gaming platforms, some companies have begun exploring gaming-specific services that resemble traditional financial products. For example, J.P. Morgan recently expressed interest in an “embedded payment ecosystem” for gaming, meaning a “wallet, that can serve as a central hub for anything related to a player: gaming credentials, in-game currency balances and transactions and spending history.”149 J.P. Morgan Payments has also provided strategic investment to Tilia, a payment processer and subsidiary of Linden Lab.150 Tilia was created to provide financial services to virtual worlds in the form of in-game transactions, payouts to creators, and conversions of in-game currencies to fiat currency, including USD. “Tilia is currently partnered with several virtual worlds, online games, and NFT marketplaces, including Second Life, Upland and Avatus.”151

Similar products have also emerged by technology companies. ZELF launched in the US in June 2022 as a banking service for virtual worlds with the intention of easing the transfer of money between the online world and the offline world, as well as trading gaming assets between players.152 This was done through an instant and virtual Visa credit card secured by a deposit account, known as a ZELF Account, that could be opened within 30 seconds using only the applicant’s name, email, and phone number.153 Once issued, users could deposit crypto-assets, NFTs, and gaming assets to then be converted into fiat currency.154 Additionally, ZELF’s marketing suggests that its intended target audience was Gen Z and young people.155 According to reporting, the ZELF Account aimed to provide young people the ability to facilitate borrowing against gaming assets by holding game currency in escrow and providing players with payday loans.156 The ZELF Account157 was shut down within two days of publicly launching.158

In 2023, MetaLend announced a program that would allow “Axie Infinity players to take out loans against their in-game crypto-based assets.”159 Further, in 2022, an international technology company offered a two-year loan for approximately $30,000 to a Decentraland gamer. The loan was used to purchase digital land in the crypto-based virtual world and many reports at the time referred to the loan as the first mortgage of the metaverse. In the loan, the technology company owned the land and the borrower had to pay monthly payments to use the land. Once paid, the land would transfer to the borrower.160

The role of banks and consumer finance products within gaming is evolving, but there appears to be a trend towards introducing services that are similar to traditional consumer financial products that rely on the value of gaming assets and the digital transactions that are happening on gaming platforms.

Conclusion

For several years, the most popular video games have included immersive virtual worlds that offer the storage and exchange of valuable assets. Gaming companies have created digital marketplaces that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of these assets with limited consumer protections, which has led to potentially harmful practices for players including financial losses due to theft and scams.

Consumer protection laws apply to banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. The CFPB is monitoring non-traditional markets where consumer financial products and services may be offered, including where such products and services are provided by or in connection with proprietary gaming platforms.

Additionally, the vast accumulation of data collected from consumers by gaming companies raises questions as to whether privacy rules are being adhered to and whether consumers, especially young ones and their parents, are fully aware of how their data is being collected and used across the industry. The CFPB will continue to work with other agencies to monitor companies that assemble and sell sensitive consumer data, such as a consumer's payment history, especially when this data is harvested and monetized without the user’s awareness.

The public can submit complaints about consumer financial products and services on consumerfinance.gov/complaint or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Only complaints sent to companies for a response are published in the Consumer Complaint Database. Many complaints about gaming assets or accounts are not, but complaints that are not sent to the company for response are often referred to other regulatory agencies for handling under applicable law. The CFPB will continue to monitor evolving gaming markets and the costs and risks incurred by consumers.

Consumers who suspect a scam can contact their local police or state attorney general. Visit the National Association of Attorneys General  website for the contact information of each state attorney general.

Employees that believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.

A loot box is a seemingly randomized package of game assets where the player only knows the contents after paying and opening the package. Prior to opening a loot box, the contents are often marketed as containing rare and valuable items missing from a player’s collection, or game currency. These assets can then be sold for fiat currency on third-party websites.

“But why should we worry about using eye-tracking? Before going deep into the privacy concerns, let’s first see how does the eye-tracking data look like. Let’s look at the figure, where I plot one user’s eye gaze data as a heat map when they are browsing on an online store. We can see the two major clusters in the dense orange that represent users’ attention. The eye gaze data can be [bucketed] into two categories, fixation, and saccade. Fixations are eye gaze located close to each other, and it’s associated with users’ visual attention. Saccades are eye gaze traveling fast from one fixation to another. Users’ fixation … is associated with the regional interest in a visual scene. [Headsets] can analyze the spatial distribution of such eye gaze absolute positions to note about their attention, even subconsciously. Also, they can associate the aggregate statistic of eye gaze distribution with a lot of traits…These traits include psychological traits and physiological traits, such as implicit interest, cultural backgrounds, personality traits, health status, like Alzheimer’s or vision condition, and biometric identities and so on.” See FTC, supra note 50, at 58-59.

On July 11, 2023, the Bureau issued an order ...",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/bank-of-america-n-a-fees/,"Bank of America, N.A.

On July 11, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against Bank of America, N.A., which is a national bank headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina with branches and ATMs located in 38 states and the District of Columbia. When a consumer writes a check or authorizes an ACH transaction to a merchant or other payee using their deposit account at Bank of America, the merchant or other payee may then present that check or ACH authorization to the bank for payment. Until February 2022, if a consumer did not have sufficient funds in their account to pay for the transaction and the bank decided not to pay it, Bank of America assessed the consumer a $35 non-sufficient funds fee. Merchants commonly “re-present” these returned transactions—that is, they again try to receive payment—often multiple times. For many years, Bank of America assessed non-sufficient fund fees on ACH and check transactions that it returned unpaid even though it had already assessed a $35 fee for the same ACH or check transaction that it had previously returned unpaid (i.e., repeat non-sufficient fund fees). Bank of America would assess these repeat non-sufficient fund fees potentially as soon as the next day after the initial transaction. From September 2018 until February 2022, Bank of America generated hundreds of millions of dollars in such fees. The Bureau found that Bank of America’s assessment of repeat non-sufficient fund fees was unfair in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The Bureau’s order requires Bank of America to refund all repeat non-sufficient fund fees that it collected since September 2018 and has not yet refunded, totaling approximately $80.4 million in redress. The bank must also pay a $60 million civil penalty to the Bureau. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) concurrently issued an order against the Bank separately fining it $60 million.

What is an escrow or impound account?
English
Español

An escrow account, sometimes called an impound account depending on where you live, is set up by your mortgage lender to pay certain property-related expenses.


The money that goes into the account comes from a portion of your monthly mortgage payment. An escrow account helps you pay these expenses because you send money through your lender or servicer, every month, instead of having to pay a big bill once or twice a year. 

Many lenders require that you pay your taxes and insurance using escrow, so they can make sure that the bill gets paid. Your mortgage servicer will manage the escrow account and pay these bills on your behalf. Sometimes, escrow accounts may also be required by law.

Your property taxes and insurance premiums can change from year to year. Your escrow payment—and  with it, your total monthly payment will change accordingly. 

Tip: If your loan doesn’t include an escrow account, you will have to plan to pay these large expenses yourself. Be sure you budget for these extra costs and stay current on your taxes and insurance payments. If you fail to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may impose fines and penalties or place a tax lien on your home.  You could also face foreclosure.


In addition, if you fail to pay your taxes or insurance, your lender may:

Add the amounts to your loan balance

Add an escrow account to your loan

Purchase new homeowners insurance for you and bill you for it. This lender-purchased insurance, known as force-placed insurance, is typically more expensive than homeowners insurance you pay on your own. 

Even if your lender does not require an escrow account, consider requesting one voluntarily. An escrow account makes it easier to budget for your large property-related bills by paying small amounts with each mortgage payment. That way you don’t have to scramble to pay a large property tax bill or insurance premium when it comes due.

There were approximately 36 million health savings accounts in 2023 – holding more than $116 billion. These accounts provide tax benefits to help offset the costs of high deductible health plans. However, these benefits are being offset by charges like monthly maintenance fees, paper statement fees, outbound transfer fees, and account closure fees. Today’s report is part of the CFPB’s continuing efforts to reduce the risks and costs brought by financial institutions as they increase their presence in the American healthcare system.

“Health savings accounts are promoted for the tax benefits that chip away at the price tag of health care,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Many consumers do not realize the fees, switching costs, and low interest yields that will come with the accounts.”    

A health savings account is a tax-advantaged account that generally comes with a high deductible health plan. Typically, a health savings account is in the form of a deposit account selected by an employer or a health insurance company. An employee makes tax-deductible contributions that can then be used for certain health care expenses. Unspent contributions can earn interest, and roll over each year. The individual and family contribution limits for 2024 are $4,150 and $8,300, respectively.

Health savings accounts today hold more than $116 billion, a 500 percent increase since 2013. Additionally, the number of accounts rose more than three times from 2013 to 2023, 11.8 million to 35 million, respectively. The significant growth in the accounts has coincided with the rising use of high deductible health plans.

Consumers have reported a range of concerns with health savings accounts. For some consumers, these accounts come with high costs. Employers often decide on the financial service provider that will manage employees’ health savings accounts. The factors that motivate employers can differ from those of employees. Providers design health savings accounts to compete for employers. The result is that health savings accounts can often present challenges and costs for consumers, such as surprise fees, lack of fund portability, and low-yield interest rates.

When a consumer ends up with a health savings account with high fees and inferior terms, it directly reduces the funds they can allocate to their health care needs. High deductible health plans have higher deductibles than other health plans, so many individuals with these plans, such as people with chronic illnesses, experience higher upfront out-of-pocket health care costs.

High costs and fees can quickly erode a consumer’s ability to pay medical bills. In the case of health savings accounts such fees and costs can also erode tax savings. Specifically, the CFPB’s report found:

Costly, complex, and captive junk fee structures: Many providers that offer health savings accounts charge various fees, including monthly maintenance fees and paper statement fees. Expensive exit fees, like outbound transfer fees and account closure fees, can hold consumers, who may not have selected their accounts, captive to their current providers. The fees are costly and typically unavoidable.
Low interest yields: Despite the recent increase in interest rates across the United States most providers offer consistently low interest rates. Typically, these rates are less than 1%, and, sometimes, even 0%. As a result, consumers could incur significantly more in fees than they earn in interest.

The CFPB has been working to reduce the financial consequences of medical debts as well as to ensure consumers are treated fairly by providers participating in the health care sphere. In September 2023, the CFPB initiated a rulemaking to remove medical bills from many credit reports. In July 2023, the CFPB, along with other federal agencies, launched an inquiry into costly credit cards and loans pushed on patients to pay for health care costs.

The Military Savings Deposit Program (SDP) pays 10 percent interest on up to $10,000 while you are deployed in an SDP-eligible combat zone or receiving hostile fire/imminent danger pay. You can start your SDP account once you’ve been deployed for a minimum of 30 consecutive days or at least one day in each of three consecutive months. Your closest military finance office can help you set up an account and the deposit method most convenient for you.

Making Deposits

Deposits may be made in cash, by check, or through allotment. Once started, allotments may be increased or decreased as your financial situation changes. Once your account reaches a $10,000 balance, you may withdraw funds over $10,000 on a quarterly basis. Emergency withdrawal must be approved by your commanding officer who must determine that it is necessary for the health and welfare of you or your family. Deposits may not be more than your unallotted current pay and allowances. The maximum amount that can earn 10 percent interest is $10,000 (principal and accrued interest combined), so any amount greater than $10,000 in your SDP will earn no interest. The interest you earn on your SDP account is not tax-exempt.

Making Withdrawals

Your account will be closed, and all funds returned to you via direct deposit 120 days after leaving the combat zone. You cannot close your account until you have left the combat zone, although your money will continue to draw interest for 90 days once you’ve returned home or to your permanent duty station. If you want your funds before the 120-day period ends, your myPay account  provides an automated request option for SDP participants.

Although not required, some banks and credit unions offer deployed servicemembers special interest-bearing accounts that may match the SDP rate. You should ask your financial institution if they have any special products available to you during deployment. You can find out more about the SDP at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service website

Data Spotlight: Trends in discount points amid rising interest rates
By CFPB Office of Mortgage Markets – APR 05, 2024
SHARE THIS

The 2022 and 2023 housing market was marked by increasing affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers as rapidly rising interest rates reached a peak of 7.79 percent by October of 2023.1 Concurrent with rising interest rates, a larger share of borrowers paid discount points.

In this spotlight, we use quarterly data collected pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to look at the borrower and loan characteristics of homeowners that paid discount points between the first quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2023, a period that included record-high mortgage interest rates and preceded the Federal Reserve’s announcement of its intention to lower interest rates. We find that:

The majority of recent borrowers paid discount points, including nearly 9 out of 10 borrowers with cash out refinances.
More borrowers paid discount points as interest rates increased.
Borrowers with lower credit scores were more likely to pay discount points.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring increases in borrowers paying discount points, as well as increases to the amount borrowers are paying in points. Discount points may provide advantages to some borrowers, but the financial tradeoffs involved in discount points are complex, creating risks for consumers.

Discount points

Discount points are a one-time fee paid at closing to a lender in exchange for a lower interest rate. Paying one discount point is the equivalent of paying a fee of one percent of the loan amount, but discount points have no fixed value in terms of the change in interest rate. For example, a borrower with a $400,000 loan might have to pay one discount point ($4,000) to reduce their interest rate by 0.25%, but another lender might equate one discount point, at the same cost, with a higher or lower interest rate reduction. Similarly, interest rates offered by different lenders with or without discount points may also vary. For example, a lender may offer an interest rate of 7.0% without any discount points, while another lender may offer that same rate with one discount point. Discount points are typically paid by the borrower, but they can be paid by the home seller or a third-party, such as a homebuilder.

Lenders’ advertisements and initial price quotes to consumers often include discount points in the fine print, which can make their interest rates appear more competitive. Although discount points and APR are disclosed in advertisements and later in the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, consumers who don’t understand the mechanics of discounts points could mistakenly believe a lender’s interest rate is a better deal than it is. Since discount points add an additional layer of complexity, borrowers would need to get offers from multiple lenders that have either the same interest rate or the same amount of discount points to tell which offer is the better deal for their situation. Choosing a loan based only on the interest rate can lead borrowers to pay for more discount points (sometimes unwittingly) than is optimal for their situation.

Even when consumers understand how discount points work, most borrowers only benefit from discount points if they keep their mortgage long enough that the cumulative monthly savings from the reduced interest rate outweigh the upfront costs. This is often referred to as keeping the mortgage past the “break-even period,” which can be roughly estimated by dividing the cost of the discount points by the borrower’s monthly savings. Borrowers who plan to keep their mortgage for a long time and have cash on hand may find it advantageous to pay discount points. However, discount points are less useful for cash-strapped borrowers and those who expect to refinance or move in the near future. Additionally, the historically high interest rate environment of the last year may prompt a higher share of borrowers to consider paying discount points to manage their monthly payments, especially when comparing it to the low interest rate environment that encompassed 2020 and 2021.

Data and methodology

Discount points is one of the data points collected and reported under HMDA. Lenders report the total amount that was paid, in dollars, to reduce the interest rate in the “discount points” data point. However, HMDA does not include how much the borrower’s interest rate is reduced based on the discount points paid or how much borrowers understand about discount points as a means of lowering their rate. In this data spotlight, we consider borrowers as having paid discount points if they paid at least an eighth of a point, or 0.125 percent of the loan balance, in discount points.

HMDA is a data collection, reporting, and disclosure statute enacted by Congress in 1975, which requires financial institutions to report application-level information about mortgages. HMDA data are the most comprehensive source of publicly available information on the U.S. mortgage market. In addition to submitting annual application-level data, the largest mortgage lenders must submit quarterly HMDA data to their regulators. Aggregate statistics from the quarterly data are publicly available in the HMDA quarterly graphs.

In 2023, 43 financial institutions submitted HMDA quarterly data. These institutions accounted for about 58 percent of the application/loan counts in 2022, despite representing only a small portion of the 4,451 financial institutions that reported HMDA annual data in 2022.

For the purposes of this data spotlight, we combined the quarterly data of the HMDA filers for 2023 with their annual HMDA data from 2019 through 2022, limiting our analysis to include closed-end, first-lien, 30-year mortgages for owner-occupied, site-built, one-to-four family homes, excluding reverse mortgages.

The majority of recent borrowers paid discount points, especially when getting cash out

Most consumers who got a mortgage in the first three quarters of 2023 paid some amount of discount points. Discount points were most common among borrowers with cash-out refinances, with nearly 9 out of 10 of those borrowers paying discount points. Additionally, 58.7 percent of borrowers with home purchase loans and 56.2 percent of borrowers with non-cash-out refinance loans paid discount points, as shown in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1: Volume of loans with discount points by loan purpose, Jan – Sep 2023

Source: HMDA quarterly data for 2023.

Borrowers with cash-out refinances also bought a larger number of discount points. The median amount of discount points (among borrowers who got them) was 2.1 points for cash-out refinance loans, 1.1 points for non-cash-out refinances, and 1.0 point for home purchase loans.

Even amidst the high interest rate environment, almost 200,000 borrowers in the 2023 quarterly data used cash-out refinances to tap their home equity. These borrowers may be cash-strapped and looking for ways to pay bills or other debts, which was the most popular use for funds from cash-out refinances from 2014 to 2020, according to the National Survey of Mortgage Originators .2

Borrowers with cash-out refinances may be more likely to pay discount points or be offered them by default because they have a ready source of liquidity: they can use the cash they would have gotten from their home equity to pay for the discount points. In contrast, borrowers with home purchase and non-cash-out loans typically have to pay for discount points out of pocket if they exceed the limit on how much of the closing costs (including discount points) can be rolled into the loan. Discount points can complicate the already-complex choice for homeowners to pursue cash-out refinancing over other sources of liquidity.

More borrowers paid discount points as interest rates rose

Across loan purpose categories, borrowers were more likely to pay discount points during periods where interest rates were high. For example, when interest rates on 30-year mortgages hovered at 2.6 percent in January of 2021, only 61.2 percent of cash-out refinance borrowers paid discount points. By the end of September 2023, interest rates had reached as much as 7.3 percent, and the share of cash-out refinance borrowers that paid discount points had increased to 87.4 percent. The same pattern follows for home purchase and refinance borrowers, which saw the share of borrowers that paid discount points jump from 30.5 percent and 36.4 percent in 2021 to 60.7 percent and 57.5 percent in 2023, respectively.

FIGURE 2: Mortgage interest rates, share of loans with discount points, and loan volumes, Jan 2019 – Sep 2023

Source: HMDA quarterly and annual data, Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey .

The increase in the share of borrowers that paid discount points likely contributed to the rise in total loan costs, another data point collected under HMDA, seen in 2022.3 The total loan costs reported in HMDA include the origination fees charged by the lender, fees for services the borrower cannot shop around for (e.g., credit report fees), fees for services the borrower can shop around for (e.g., title insurance), and discount points paid. The median total loan costs for home purchase loans jumped by 21.8 percent between 2021 and 2022, while the median total loan costs for refinance loans increased by 49.3 percent.

As interest rates rose, more borrowers paid discount points. Industry participants have anecdotally noted that some consumers had anchored their expectations around the historically low rates from earlier years and were more willing to pay upfront costs to get a lower interest rate. It may also reflect borrower expectations that interest rates would remain high. Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey suggests that, throughout most of 2023, consumers believed mortgage interest rates would continue to rise over the next year.4 Additionally, some lenders may have included discount points to maintain the interest rate borrowers received when they were offered prequalification for the mortgage in order to remain qualified, or to incentivize borrowers with lower interest rates.

However, research by Freddie Mac  shows the interest rate differential between prime, conventional borrowers that paid discount points and those that did not pay discount points between 2018 and 2023 was minor, suggesting that paying discount points may not be the optimal option for consumers, though the analysis did not fully control for borrower and loan attributes.5

Discount points also play a role for investors who hold mortgage debt. When interest rates are falling or are expected to fall, investors face a high prepayment risk because consumers are likely to refinance and pay off their mortgage early (prepay). Therefore, even though an investor would benefit from a high interest rate, they know the cash flows could be short lived. Discount points can reduce the prepayment risk on a loan by lowering a consumer’s interest rate and thereby lowering their incentive to refinance. However, HMDA data do not include data on how much the borrower’s interest rate is reduced based on the discount points paid, making it difficult to analyze the likely magnitude or impact of these dynamics.

Homebuyers with lower credit scores were more likely to pay discount points

Homebuyers with low credit scores tended to pay discount points more often than borrowers with high scores, though trends vary across mortgage type. Overall, about 65 percent of homebuyers with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans paid discount points, compared to 62 percent for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans and 57 percent for conventional loans. FHA and VA loans typically serve as alternative affordable options to conventional mortgages for homebuyers.

Figure 3 shows the share of home purchase borrowers that paid discount points, by loan type and credit score, in 2023. The borrowers who were least likely to pay discount points were conventional and VA homebuyers with credit scores of 800 or more. Yet even among these super-prime borrowers, slightly more than half paid discount points.

Meanwhile, discount points were especially prevalent among FHA homebuyers with low credit scores. FHA loans serve a large segment of the first-time homebuying population, likely a result of its product features, including its low-down payment options.6 As of 2023, about 4 out of every 5 FHA borrowers were first-time homebuyers.7 While we might not expect such a large share of FHA borrowers, a majority of which are first-time homebuyers, to have the funds available to pay a higher amount of closing costs, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of FHA borrowers paid discount points. Usage of discount points is sharply higher for consumers with credit scores below 640, which is also the score range where it can become more difficult to qualify for FHA loans because lenders start to impose additional underwriting requirements.

FIGURE 3: Credit scores of home purchase loans with discount points, by loan type, 2023

It's possible lenders are offering these borrowers mortgages with discount points to ensure they qualify for a mortgage by lowering their monthly mortgage payments. As mentioned earlier, paying discount points can lower the interest rate on a mortgage and therefore the monthly payments for the life of the loan. Lenders may be attempting to lower the monthly payments and therefore the DTI so borrowers qualify for a mortgage. While most first-time homebuyers may be cash-strapped, many may look for alternative ways to finance their closing costs, like soliciting the financial help of family or friends to help pay discount points or negotiating for the seller to pay them.

In summary, 2022 and 2023 were marked by record-breaking interest rates that forced borrowers to quickly adapt. As a result, borrowers were more likely to pay discount points, with cash-out refinance borrowers the most likely to pay discount points as compared to other borrowers, and more likely to pay more discount points. In addition to adapting to the high interest rate environment, many lenders may also be using discount points to ensure that borrowers qualify for a mortgage. Borrowers with lower credit scores were more likely than those with higher credit scores to pay discount points, with discount points the most prevalent among FHA borrowers with low credit scores. This indicates that lenders may be using discount points to lower monthly payments and therefore debt-to-income ratio, one of the measurements lenders use to assess a borrower’s ability to repay, to qualify for a mortgage.

Analysis of HMDA data shows a rising share of borrowers are relying on discount points to lower their mortgage interest rate or to qualify for a mortgage. As discount points have become a more common part of the market, it becomes more important to understand the factors driving the increase in discount points and how borrowers end up paying for them.

What is an emergency fund?

An emergency fund is a cash reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical bills, or a loss of income.

In general, emergency savings can be used for large or small unplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine monthly expenses and spending.




Why do I need it?

Without savings, a financial shock—even minor—could set you back, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting impact.

Research suggests that individuals who struggle to recover from a financial shock have less savings to help protect against a future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to debt that’s generally harder to pay off. They may also pull from other savings, like retirement funds, to cover these costs.

Take our quiz




How much do I need in it?

The amount you need to have in an emergency savings fund depends on your situation. Think about the most common kind of unexpected expenses you’ve had in the past and how much they cost. This may help you set a goal for how much you want to have set aside.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck or don’t get paid the same amount each week or month, putting any money aside can feel difficult. But, even a small amount can provide some financial security.

Keep reading to find the savings strategy, or strategies, that work best for you.




How do I build it?

There are different strategies to get your savings started. These strategies cover a range of situations, including if you have a limited ability to save or if your pay tends to fluctuate. It may be that you could use all of these strategies, but if you have a limited ability to save, managing your cash flow or putting away a portion of your tax refund are the easiest ways to get started.

Strategy: Create a savings habit

Building a savings of any size is easier when you’re able to consistently put money away. It’s one of the fastest ways to see it grow. If you’re not in a regular practice of saving, there are a few key principles to creating and sticking to a savings habit:

Set a goal. Having a specific goal for your savings  can help you stay motivated. Establishing your emergency fund may be that achievable goal that helps you stay on track, especially when you’re initially getting started. Use our savings planning tool  to calculate how long it’ll take you to reach your goal, based on how much and how often you’re able to put money away.
Create a system for making consistent contributions. There are a number of different ways to save, and as you’ll read below, setting up automatic recurring transfers is often one of the easiest. It may also be that you put a specific amount of cash aside each day, week, or payday period. Aim to make it a specific amount, and if you can occasionally afford to do more, you’ll watch your savings grow even faster.
Regularly monitor your progress. Find a way to regularly check your savings. Whether it’s an automatic notification of your account balance or writing down a running total of your contributions, finding a way to watch your progress can offer gratification and encouragement to keep going.
Celebrate your successes. If you’re sticking with your savings habit, don’t miss the opportunity to recognize what you’ve accomplished. Find a few ways that you can treat yourself, and if you’ve reached your goal, set your next one.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. If you know you have a regular paycheck or money consistently coming in, you can create a habit to put some of that money towards an emergency savings fund.




Strategy: Manage your cash flow


Your cash flow  is essentially the timing of when your money is coming in (your income) and going out (your expenses and spending). If the timing is off, you can find yourself running short at the end of the week or month, but if you’re actively tracking it, you’ll start to see opportunities to adjust your spending and savings .

For example, you may be able to work with your creditors (like your landlord, utility companies, or credit card companies) to adjust the due dates for your bills, or you can use the weeks when you have more money available to move a little extra into savings.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone. This is one important first step in managing your money, regardless of whether you’re living paycheck to paycheck or have a tendency to spend more than your budget allows.




Strategy: Take advantage of one-time opportunities to save

There may also be certain times during the year when you get an influx of money. For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. There may be other times of the year, like a holiday or birthday, that you receive a cash gift.

While it’s tempting to spend it, saving all or a portion of that money could help you quickly set up your emergency fund.


Who is this helpful for: Anyone but particularly those with irregular income. If you receive a large check from a tax refund or for some other reason, it’s always good to consider putting all or a portion of it away into savings.

Strategy: Make your saving automatic


Saving automatically is one of the easiest ways to make your savings consistent so you start to see it build over time. One common way to do this is to set up recurring transfers through your bank or credit union so money is moved automatically from your checking account to your savings account. You get to decide how much and how often, but once you have it set up, you’ll be making consistent contributions to your savings.

It’s a good idea to be mindful of your balances, however, so you don’t incur overdraft fees if there’s not enough money in your checking account at the time of the automatic transaction. To help you stay mindful, consider setting up automatic notifications or calendar reminders to check your balance.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. Again, you can determine how much and how often to have money transferred between accounts, but you want to make sure you have money coming in. If your situation changes or your income changes, you can always adjust it.




Strategy: Save through work

Another way to save automatically is through your employer. In addition to employer-based contributions for retirement, you may have an option to split your paycheck between your checking and savings accounts. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, check with your employer to see if it’s possible to divide it between two accounts. If you’re tempted to spend your paycheck when you get it, this is an easy way to put money aside without having to think twice.

Who is this helpful for: Those with consistent income. Again, if you’re getting a check from your employer on a regular basis, pay yourself first by putting a portion of it automatically into savings.




Where should I keep it?

Where you put your emergency fund depends on your situation. You want to make sure this fund is safe, accessible, and in a place where you’re not tempted to spend it on non-emergencies.

Here are a few options for where to put your emergency savings, and you can choose the one that makes the most sense for you:


Bank or credit union account — If you have an account with a bank or credit union—generally considered one of the safest places to put your money—it might make sense to have a dedicated account where you can keep and maintain these funds.
Prepaid card — A prepaid card is a card that you can load money onto. It’s not connected with a bank or credit union, and you can only spend the amount that’s on your card.
Cash — Another option is keeping money on hand for emergencies, either in your home or with a trusted family member or friend. Keep in mind that cash can be stolen, lost, or destroyed.




When should I use it?

Set some guidelines for yourself on what constitutes an emergency or unplanned expense. Not every unexpected expense is a dire emergency but try to stay consistent. Even if it’s not a trip to the emergency room, you may need it to pay for a medical bill that wasn’t covered by insurance.

Having a reserve fund for financial shocks can help you avoid relying on other forms of credit or loans that can turn into debt. If you use a credit card or take out a loan to pay for these expenses, your one-time emergency expense may grow significantly larger than your original bill because of interest and fees.

However, don’t be afraid to use it if you need it. If you spend down what’s in your emergency savings, just work to build it up again. Practicing your savings skills over time will make this easier.

Your financial well-being, or overall financial situation, is unique to you. Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.

The story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. 

How would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.

Understand where your money goes 

The prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.

2. Learn where your money is coming from.

Before you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.

3. Learn where your money is going.

Fill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.

4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.

If you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.

Small changes can make a big difference

There are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. 

5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.

Your cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .

6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.

If there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .

7. Compare your spending month-to-month.

Track your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.

Save for emergencies

Saving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. 

8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.

Start by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.

9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.

Set guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.

10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.

Whether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.

11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.

There may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.

12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.

For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.

Reduce your debt 

Paying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.

13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.

Use our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.

14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.

There are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.

15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.

Whether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.

16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

Plan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.

Create better money habits 

Improving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. 

17. Apply only for credit you need.

While it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.

18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.

You’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.

19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.

Through most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.

20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.

Missing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.

21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.

One of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.

Plan for success

Planning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. 

22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.

Break down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.

23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.

If you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.

24. Make your savings consistent.

Putting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .

25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.

Once you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!

If you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.

Debt relief or settlement companies are companies that say they can renegotiate, settle, or in some way change the terms of a person's debt to a creditor or debt collector. Dealing with these companies can be risky.

Debt settlement companies, also sometimes called ""debt relief"" or ""debt adjusting"" companies, often claim they can negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe. Consider all of your options, including working with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating directly with the creditor or debt collector yourself. Before agreeing to work with a debt settlement company, there are risks that you should consider:

Debt settlement companies often charge expensive fees.
Debt settlement companies typically encourage you to stop paying your credit card bills. If you stop paying your bills, you will usually incur late fees, penalty interest and other charges, and creditors will likely step up their collection efforts against you.
Some of your creditors may refuse to work with the company you choose.
In many cases, the debt settlement company will be unable to settle all of your debts.
If you do business with a debt settlement company, the company may tell you to put money in a dedicated bank account, which will be managed by a third party. You might be charged fees for using this account.
Working with a debt settlement company may lead to a creditor filing a debt collection lawsuit against you.
Unless the debt settlement company settles all or most of your debts, the built-up penalties and fees on the unsettled debts may wipe out any savings the debt settlement company achieves on the debts it settles.
Using debt settlement services can have a negative impact on your credit scores and your ability to get credit in the future.

Warning: Debt settlement may well leave you deeper in debt than you were when you started. Most debt settlement companies will ask you to stop paying your debts in order to get creditors to negotiate and in order to collect the funds required for a settlement. This can have a negative effect on your credit score and may result in the creditor or debt collector filing a lawsuit while you are collecting funds required for a settlement. And if you stop making payments on a credit card, late fees and interest will be added to the debt each month. If you exceed your credit limit, additional fees and charges may apply. This can cause your original debt to increase.

Avoid doing business with any company that promises to settle your debt if the company:
Charges any fees before it settles your debts;
Represents that it can settle all of your debt for a promised percentage reduction;
Touts a ""new government program"" to bail out personal credit card debt;
Guarantees it can make your debt go away;
Tells you to stop communicating with your creditors;
Tells you it can stop all debt collection calls and lawsuits; or
Guarantees that your unsecured debts can be paid off for pennies on the dollar.

An alternative to a debt settlement company is a non-profit consumer credit counseling service. These non-profits can attempt to work with you and your creditors to develop a debt management plan that you can afford, and that can help get you out of debt. They usually will also help you develop a budget and provide other financial counseling.

Also, you may want to consider consulting a bankruptcy attorney, who may be able to provide you with your options under the law. Some bankruptcy attorneys will speak to you initially free of charge.

Warning: There could be tax consequences for debt forgiveness. If a portion of your debt is forgiven by the creditor, it could be counted as taxable income on your federal income taxes. You may want to consult a tax advisor or tax attorney to learn how forgiven debt affects your federal income tax.

For servicemembers with loans taken out before entering active duty military service, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides a variety of protections, including an interest rate reduction down to 6 percent and foreclosure protections. Download our fact sheet  to learn more.

If you are on active duty when you refinance or consolidate your loans, the new loan will not be covered under the protections of the SCRA since it is no longer considered a pre-service loan. For example, if you took out a student loan before you entered active duty, but then consolidate that student loan after entering active duty, you would not then be able to request an interest rate reduction down to 6 percent on that new consolidation loan. Or, if you took out a mortgage before you entered active duty, and refinance during active duty, you would lose the foreclosure protections provided under the SCRA.

If you still have questions about your rights under the SCRA, contact your closest legal assistance (JAG) office  for more information. You also may be able to get assistance from your state attorney general .
