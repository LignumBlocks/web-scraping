best practices for budgeting personal finances,"What Is Personal Finance, and Why Is It Important?",Personal finance is about managing your budget and how best to put your money to work to realize your financial independence and goals.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp,"Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.
Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.
Personal finance is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).
Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:
1
Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.
Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.
Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.
Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.
Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.
Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.
Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.
Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.
Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.
Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.
Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:
The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.
It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.
A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:
It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:
It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.
Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.
It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.
On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.
2
Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it.

 There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.
Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:
3
Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.
Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).
4
Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.
Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.
Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.
5
Factors that determine your FICO score include:
6
FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850.
7
 Here’s how your credit is rated:
8
To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
9
Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.
Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.
10
To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.
Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.
Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.
Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).
If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.
Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.
As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.
Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt.
12
 If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.
Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.
You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.
After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.
13
Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.
Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.
The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.
Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.
Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.
Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.
Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.
Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.
You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.
If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:
Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:
The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.
Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.
Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:
One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.
There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).
Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.
Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.
Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""
However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.
The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.
Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.
Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.
Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.
The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.
The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.
An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.
For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.
Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.
Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.
The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.
Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.
The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.
At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.
Personal finance is managing your money to cover expenses and save for the future. It is a topic that covers a broad array of areas, including managing expenses and debt, how to save and invest, and how to plan for retirement. In addition, it can include ways to protect yourself with insurance, build wealth, and ensure wealth is passed on to the people you want it to pass to.
Understanding how to manage your finances is an important life-planning tool that can help set you up for a life without debt; you gain control of financial stresses and have a way to manage the expensive surprises that life can throw at you."

Here are the key steps to take.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100516/setting-financial-goals/,"Setting short-term financial goals, as well as mid-term and long-term, is an important step toward becoming financially secure. If you aren’t working toward anything specific, you’re likely to spend more than you should. You’ll then come up short when you need money for unexpected bills, not to mention when you want to retire. You might get stuck in a vicious cycle of credit card debt and feel like you never have enough cash to get properly insured, leaving you more vulnerable than you need to be to handle some of life’s major risks.
Even the most prudent person can't prepare against every crisis, as the world learned in the pandemic and many families learn every month. What thinking ahead does is give you a chance to work through things that could happen and do your best to prepare for them. This should be an ongoing process so you can shape your life and goals to fit the changes that will inevitably come.
Annual financial planning gives you an opportunity to formally review your goals, update them, and review your progress since last year. If you’ve never set goals before, take the opportunity to formulate them so you can get—or stay—on firm financial footing. Here are goals, from near-term to distant, that financial experts recommend setting to help you learn to live comfortably within your means, reduce your money troubles, and save for retirement.
Setting short-term financial goals gives you the foundation and the confidence boost that you'll need to achieve the bigger goals that take more time. These first steps can relatively easy to achieve in as little as a year: Create a budget and stick with it. Build an emergency fund. Pay down the credit card debt that's holding you back.
“You can’t know where you are going until you really know where you are right now. That means setting up a budget,” says Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a fiduciary and fee-only financial planner with Spark Financial Advisors in Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia. “You might be shocked at how much money is slipping through the cracks each month.”
An easy way to track your spending is to use a free budgeting program like Mint. It will combine the information from all your accounts into one place so you can label each expense by category. You can also create a budget the old-fashioned way by going through your bank statements and bills from the past few months and categorizing each expense with a spreadsheet or on paper.
When you see how you are spending your money and you're guided by that information, you can make better decisions about where you want your money to go in the future. Is the enjoyment and convenience of eating out worth the extra money each month to you? If so, great—as long as you can afford it. If not, you’ve just discovered an easy way to save money every month. You can look for ways to spend less when you dine out, replace some restaurant/takeout meals with homemade ones, or have a combination of the two.
An emergency fund is money you set aside specifically to pay for unexpected expenses. To get started, $500 to $1,000 is a good goal. When you meet that goal, you’ll want to expand it so that your emergency fund can cover greater financial difficulties, such as unemployment. If you didn’t have an emergency fund prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, you likely wished you did. And if you did have one, you may have tapped into it and need to replenish it.
Ilene Davis, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Financial Independence Services in Cocoa, Florida, recommends saving at least three months' worth of expenses to cover your financial obligations and basic needs, but preferably six months' worth—especially if you are married and work for the same company your spouse does or if you work in an area with limited job prospects. She says finding at least one thing in your budget to cut back on can help fund your emergency savings.
Another way to build emergency savings is through decluttering and organizing, says Kevin Gallegos, vice president of sales and Phoenix operations with Freedom Financial Network, an online financial services company for consumer debt settlement, mortgage shopping, and personal loans. You can make extra money by selling unneeded items on eBay or Craigslist or holding a yard sale. Consider turning a hobby into part-time work from which you can devote the income to savings.
Zangardi Haynes recommends opening a savings account and setting up an automatic transfer for the amount you’ve determined you can save each month (using your budget) until you hit your emergency fund goal. “If you get a bonus, tax refund, or even an ‘extra’ monthly paycheck—which happens two months out of the year if you are paid biweekly—save that money as soon as it comes into your checking account. If you wait until the end of the month to transfer that money, the odds are high that it will get spent instead of saved,” she says.
Experts disagree on whether to pay off credit card debt or create an emergency fund first. Some say that you should create an emergency fund even if you still have credit card debt because, without an emergency fund, any unexpected expense will send you further into credit card debt. Others say you should pay off credit card debt first because the interest is so costly that it makes achieving any other financial goal much more difficult. Pick the philosophy that makes the most sense to you, or do a little of both at the same time.
As a strategy for paying off credit card debt, Davis recommends listing all your debts by interest rate from lowest to highest, then paying only the minimum on all but your highest-rate debt. Use any additional funds you have to make extra payments on your highest-rate card.
The method Davis describes is called the debt avalanche. Another method to consider is called the debt snowball. With the snowball method, you pay off your debts in order of smallest to largest, regardless of the interest rate. The idea is that the sense of accomplishment you get from paying off the smallest debt will give you the momentum to tackle the next-smallest debt, and so on until you’re debt-free.
Gallegos says debt negotiation or settlement is an option for those with $10,000 or more in unsecured debt (such as credit card debt) who can’t afford the required minimum payments. Companies that offer these services are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and work on the consumer’s behalf to cut debt by as much as 50% in exchange for a fee, typically a percentage of the total debt or a percentage of the amount of debt reduction, which the consumer should only pay after a successful negotiation.
1
 Consumers can get out of debt in two to four years this way, Gallegos says. The drawbacks are that debt settlement can hurt your credit score, and creditors can take legal action against consumers for unpaid accounts.
2
When you’ve created a budget, established an emergency fund, and paid off your credit card debt—or at least made a good dent in those three short-term goals—it’s time to start working toward midterm financial goals. These goals will create a bridge between your short- and long-term financial goals.
Do you have a spouse or children who depend on your income? If so, you need life insurance to provide for them in case you pass away prematurely. Term life insurance is the least complicated and least expensive type of life insurance and will meet most people’s insurance needs.
4
 An insurance broker can help you find the best price on a policy. Most term life insurance requires medical underwriting, and unless you are seriously ill, you can probably find at least one company that will offer you a policy.
Gallegos also says that you should have disability insurance in place to protect your income while you are working. “Most employers provide this coverage,” he says. “If they don’t, individuals can obtain it themselves until retirement age.”
Disability insurance will replace a portion of your income if you become seriously ill or injured to the point that you can’t work. It can provide a larger benefit than Social Security disability income, allowing you (and your family, if you have one) to live more comfortably than you otherwise will if you lose your ability to earn an income. There will be a waiting period between when you become unable to work and when your insurance benefits will start to pay out, which is another reason why having an emergency fund is so important.
Student loans are a major drag on many people’s monthly budgets. Lowering or getting rid of those payments can free up cash that will make it easier to save for retirement and meet your other goals. One strategy that can help you pay off your student loans is refinancing into a new loan with a lower interest rate. But beware: If you refinance federal student loans with a private lender, you may lose some of the benefits associated with federal student loans, such as income-based repayment, deferment, and forbearance, which can help if you fall on hard times.

﻿
Midterm goals can also include goals like buying a first home or, later on, a vacation home. Maybe you already have a home and want to upgrade it with a major renovation—or start saving for a larger place. Saving for college expenses or the costs that come with starting a family are other examples of midterm goals.
When you've set one or more of these goals, start figuring out how much you need to save to make a dent in reaching them. Visualizing the type of future you want is the first step toward achieving it.
The biggest long-term financial goal for most people is saving enough money to retire. The common rule of thumb is that you should save 10% to 15% of every paycheck in a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or 403(b), if you have access to one, or a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. But to make sure you’re really saving enough, you need to figure out how much you'll actually need to retire.
Oscar Vives Ortiz, a CPA financial planner with PNC Wealth Management in the Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg, Florida, area, says you can do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate your retirement readiness:
If, for example, you started with a portfolio of $1 million and withdrew $40,000 in year one (4% of $1 million), then increased the withdrawal by the rate of inflation each subsequent year ($40,000 plus 2% in year two, or $40,800; $40,800 plus 2% in year three, or $41,616, and so on), you would have made it through any 30-year retirement without running out of money. “This is why you often see 4% as a rule of thumb when discussing retirement,” Vives Ortiz says.
“In most scenarios, you actually end up with more money at the end of 30 years using 4%, but in the worst of the worst, you would have run out of money in year 30,” he adds. “The only word of caution here is that just because 4% has survived every scenario in history does not guarantee it will continue to do so going forward.”
Ortiz provided the following example of how to estimate whether you’re on track to retire:
*For simplicity, we have not included the rate of return that would be earned over the next 10 years on the current investments.
For most people who have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the employer will match a percentage of what you are paid, says CFP Vincent Oldre, founder of CFG Retirement in Minneapolis. They might match 3% or even 7% of your paycheck. You can get a 100% return on your investment if you contribute enough to get your full employer match, and this is the most important step to take to fund your retirement.
“What kills me is that people do not put money into their retirement plan because either they ‘can’t afford to’ or they are ‘afraid of the stock market.’ They miss out on what I call a ‘no-brainer’ return,” Oldre says.
Michael Cirelli, a financial advisor with SAI Financial in Warrenville, Illinois, recommends making IRA contributions at the beginning of the year as opposed to the end, when most people tend to do it, to give the money more time to grow and give yourself a larger amount to retire with.
You probably won’t make perfect, linear progress toward achieving any of your goals, but the important thing is to be consistent. If you are hit with an unexpected car repair or medical bill one month and can’t contribute to your emergency fund but have to take money out of it instead, don’t beat yourself up; That’s what the fund is there for. Just get back on track as soon as you can.
The same is true if you lose your job or get sick. You’ll have to create a new plan to get through that difficult period, and you may not be able to pay down debt or save for retirement during that time, but you can resume your original plan—or perhaps a revised version—when you come out on the other side.
That’s the beauty of annual financial planning: You can review and update your goals and monitor your progress in reaching them throughout life’s ups and downs. In the process, you will find that both the small things you do on a daily and monthly basis and the bigger things you do every year and over the decades will help you achieve your financial goals."
importance of emergency funds in financial stability,The Ultimate Guide to Financial Literacy for Adults,"Investopedia rounds up the best educational content for students, teachers, and anyone else interested in learning personal finance and investing.",https://www.investopedia.com/guide-to-financial-literacy-4800530,"We know that the earlier you learn the basics of how money works, the more confident and successful you’ll be with your finances later in life. It’s never too late to start learning, but it pays to have a head start. The first steps into the world of money start with education.
Banking, budgeting, saving, credit, debt, and investing are the pillars that support most of the financial decisions that we’ll make in our lives. At Investopedia, we have more than 36,000 articles, terms, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and videos that explore these topics. We’ve spent 25 years building and improving our resources to help you make smart financial and investing decisions.
This guide is a great place to start, and today is a great day to do it. Let’s begin with financial literacy—what it is and how it can improve your life.
Financial literacy is the ability to understand and make use of a variety of financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. It also means comprehending certain financial principles and concepts, such as the time value of money, compound interest, managing debt, and financial planning.
Achieving financial literacy can help individuals to avoid making poor financial decisions. It can help them become self-sufficient and achieve financial stability. Key steps to attaining financial literacy include learning how to create a budget, track spending, pay off debt, and plan for retirement.
Educating yourself on these topics also involves learning how money works, setting and achieving financial goals, becoming aware of unethical/discriminatory financial practices, and managing financial challenges that life throws your way.
In its National Financial Capability Study the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that Americans with higher levels of financial literacy were more likely to make ends meet, spend less of their income, create a three-month emergency fund, and open a retirement account than those with lower financial literacy.

Making informed financial decisions is more important than ever. Take retirement planning. Many workers once relied on pension plans to fund their retirement lives, with the financial burden and decision-making for pension funds borne by the companies or governments that sponsored them.
Today, few workers get pensions; instead, some are offered the option of participating in a 401(k) plan. This involves decisions that employees themselves have to make about contribution levels and investment choices. Even contributing to a 401(k) may not be enough to afford a comfortable retirement. And those without employer options need to actively seek out and open individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
Add to this people’s increasing life spans (leading to longer retirements), Social Security benefits that barely support basic survival, complicated health or other insurance options, more complex savings and investment instruments to select from—and a plethora of choices from banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, credit card companies, and more.
It’s clear that financial literacy is a must for making thoughtful and informed decisions, avoiding unnecessary levels of debt, helping family members through these complex decisions, and having adequate income in retirement.
Personal finance is where financial literacy translates into individual financial decision-making. How do you manage your money? Which savings and investment vehicles are you using? Personal finance is about making and meeting your financial goals, whether you want to own a home, help other members of your family, save for your children’s college education, support causes that you care about, plan for retirement, or anything else.
Among other topics, it encompasses banking, budgeting, handling debt and credit, and investing. Let’s take a look at these basics to get you started.
A bank account is typically the first financial account that you’ll open. Bank accounts can hold and build the money you'll need for major purchases and life events. Here’s some background on bank accounts and why they are step one in creating a stable financial future.
Though the majority of Americans do have bank accounts, 6% of households in the United States still don’t have one.
2
 Why is it so important to open a bank account? Because it’s safer than holding cash. Assets held in a bank are harder to steal, and in the U.S., they’re generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
3
 That means you should always have access to your cash, even if every customer decides to withdraw their money at the same time.
Many financial transactions require you to have a bank account to:
When you think of a bank, you probably picture a building. This is called a brick-and-mortar bank. Many brick-and-mortar banks also allow you to open accounts and manage your money online.
Some banks are only online and have no physical buildings. These banks typically offer the same services as brick-and-mortar banks, aside from the ability to visit them in person.
Retail banks: This is the most common type of bank at which people have accounts. Retail banks are for-profit companies that offer checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, and insurance. Retail banks can have physical, in-person buildings that you can visit or they can be online only. Most offer both options. Banks’ online technology tends to be advanced, and they often have more locations and ATMs nationwide than credit unions do.
Credit unions: Credit unions provide savings and checking accounts, issue loans, and offer other financial products, just like banks do. However, they are not-for-profit organizations owned by their members. Credit unions tend to have lower fees and better interest rates on savings accounts and loans. Credit unions are sometimes known for providing more personalized customer service, though they usually have far fewer branches and ATMs.
There are three main types of bank accounts that the average person may want to open:
1. Savings account: A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Savings accounts typically pay a low interest rate, but their safety and reliability make them a sensible option for saving available cash for short-term needs.
They may have some legal limitations on how often you can withdraw money. However, they’re generally very flexible so they’re ideal for building an emergency fund, saving for a short-term goal like buying a car or going on vacation, or simply storing extra cash that you don’t need in your checking account.
2. Checking account: A checking account is also a deposit account at a bank or other financial institution that allows you to make deposits and withdrawals. Checking accounts are very liquid, meaning that they allow numerous withdrawals per month (as opposed to less liquid savings or investment accounts) though they earn little to no interest.
Money can be deposited at banks and ATMs, through direct deposit, or through another type of electronic transfer. Account holders can withdraw funds via banks and ATMs, by writing checks, or using debit cards linked to their accounts.
You may be able to find a checking account with no fees. Others have monthly and other charges (such as for overdrafts or using an out-of-network ATM) based on, for example, how much you keep in the account or whether there’s a direct deposit paycheck or automatic withdrawal mortgage payment connected to the account.
Lifeline and second-chance accounts, available at some banks, can help those who have difficulty qualifying for a traditional checking account.
3. High-yield savings account: A high-yield savings account usually pays a much higher rate of interest than a standard savings account. The tradeoff for earning more interest on your money is that high-yield accounts tend to require bigger initial deposits, larger minimum balances, and higher fees.
An emergency fund is not a specific type of bank account but can be any source of cash that you’ve saved to help you handle financial hardships like job losses, medical bills, or car repairs. Here's how they work:
You know them as the plastic cards that (almost) everyone carries in their wallets. Credit cards are accounts that let you borrow money from the credit card issuer and pay it back over time. For every month that you don’t pay back the money in full, you’ll be charged interest on your remaining balance. Note that some credit cards, called charge cards, require you to pay your balance in full each month. However, these are less common.
Here is the difference:
Debit cards take money directly out of your checking account. You can’t borrow money with debit cards, which means that you can’t spend more cash than you have in the bank. And debit cards don’t help you to build a credit history and credit rating.
Credit cards allow you to borrow money and do not pull cash from your bank account. This can be helpful for large, unexpected purchases. But carrying a balance every month—not paying back in full the money that you borrowed—means that you’ll owe interest to the credit card issuer. In fact, as of Q1 2024, Americans owed $1.12 trillion in credit card debt.
5
 So be very careful about spending more money than you have, because debt can build up quickly and become difficult to pay off.
On the other hand, using a credit card judiciously and paying your credit card bills on time helps you establish a credit history and a good credit rating. It’s important to build a good credit rating not only to qualify for the best credit cards but also because you will get more favorable interest rates on car loans, personal loans, and mortgages.
APR stands for annual percentage rate. This is the amount of interest that you’ll owe the credit card issuer on any unpaid balance. You’ll want to pay close attention to this number when you apply for a credit card. A higher number can cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars if you carry a large balance over time. The median APR today is nearly 25%, but your rate may be higher if you have bad credit. Interest rates also tend to vary by the type of credit card.
Credit scores have a big impact on your odds of getting approved for a credit card. Understanding what range your score falls into can help you narrow the options as you decide on the cards for which you may apply. Beyond your credit score, you’ll also need to decide which perks best suit your lifestyle and spending habits.
If you’ve never had a credit card before, or if you have bad credit, you’ll likely need to apply for either a secured credit card or a subprime credit card. By using one of these and paying back on time, you can raise your credit score and earn the right to credit at better rates.
If you have a fair to good credit score, you can choose from a variety of credit card types, such as:
Be aware of your protections under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Research credit opportunities and available interest rates, and be sure that you are offered the best rates for your particular credit history and financial situation.
Creating a budget is one of the simplest and most effective ways to control your spending, saving, and investing. You can’t begin to improve your financial health if you don’t know where your money is going, so start tracking your expenses against your income. Then set clear goals.
Budgeting starts with tracking how much money you receive and spend every month. You can do this in an Excel sheet, on paper, or with a budgeting app. It’s up to you. However you decide to track, clearly lay out the following:
Subtract your total expenses from your total income to get the amount of money you have left at the end of the month. Now that you have a clear picture of money coming in, money going out, and money saved, you can identify which expenses you can cut back on, if necessary.
If you don’t already have one, put your extra money into an emergency fund until you’ve saved at least three to six months’ worth of expenses (in case of a job loss or other emergency). Don’t use this money for discretionary spending. The key is to keep it safe and grow it for times when your income decreases or stops.
Once you have enough savings to start investing, you’ll want to learn the basics of where and how to invest your money. Decide what to invest in and how much to invest by understanding the risks (and potential rewards) of different types of investments.
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where stock buying and selling takes place. The terms “stock market” and “stock exchange” can be used interchangeably. And even though it’s called a stock market, other financial securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate bonds, and derivatives based on stocks, commodities, currencies, and bonds, are also traded there. There are multiple stock trading venues. The leading stock exchanges in the U.S. include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and the Cboe Options Exchange.
To buy stocks, you need to use a broker. This is a professional person or digital platform whose job it is to handle the transaction for you. For new investors, there are three basic categories of brokers:
There’s no right answer for everyone. Which securities you buy, and how much you buy, will depend on the amount of money that you have available for investing and how much risk you’re willing to take to try to earn a higher return. Here are the most common securities to invest in, listed in descending order of risk:
Stocks: A stock (also known as “shares” or “equity”) is a type of investment that signifies partial ownership in the issuing company. This entitles the stockholder to a proportion of the corporation’s assets and earnings.
Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends (which come from the company’s profits) if and when they are distributed, and sell your shares to somebody else.
The price of a stock fluctuates throughout the day and can depend on many factors, including the company’s performance, the domestic economy, the global economy, the day’s news, and more. Stocks can rise in value, fall in value, or even become worthless, making them more volatile and potentially riskier than many other types of investments.
ETFs: An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, consists of a collection of securities, such as stocks. It often tracks an underlying index. ETFs can invest in any number of industry sectors or use various strategies.
Think of an ETF as a pie containing many different securities. When you buy shares of an ETF, you’re buying a slice of the pie, which contains slivers of the securities inside. This lets you purchase a variety of stocks at once, with the ease and convenience of only one purchase—the ETF.
In many ways, ETFs are similar to mutual funds. For instance, they both offer instant diversification and are professionally managed. However, ETFs are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just like ordinary stocks.
Investing in ETFs is considered less risky than investing in individual stocks because there are many securities inside the ETF. If some of those securities fall in value, others may stay steady or rise in value.
Mutual funds: A mutual fund is a type of investment consisting of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios at a low price.
There are many categories of mutual funds, representing the kinds of securities in which they invest, their investment objectives, and the type of returns that they seek. Most employer-sponsored retirement plans invest in mutual funds.
Investing in shares of a mutual fund is different from investing in individual shares of stock because a mutual fund owns many different stocks (or other securities). Unlike stocks or ETFs that trade at varying prices throughout the day, mutual fund purchases and redemptions​ take place only at the end of each trading day and at a fund's net asset value (NAV). Similar to ETFs, mutual funds are considered less risky than stocks because of their diversification.
Bonds: Bonds are issued by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. When an investor buys a bond, they’re effectively lending their money to the bond issuer, with the promise of repayment plus interest. A bond’s coupon rate is the interest rate that the investor will earn.
A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument because bonds traditionally have paid a fixed interest rate to investors, although some bonds pay variable interest rates. Bond prices inversely correlate with interest rates. When rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds have maturity dates, which are the point in time when the principal amount must be paid back to the investor in full or the issuer will risk default.
Bonds are rated by how likely the issuer is to pay you back. Higher-rated bonds, known as investment-grade bonds, are viewed as safer and more stable. Such offerings are tied to publicly traded corporations and government entities that boast positive outlooks.
Investment grade bonds receive “AAA” to “BBB-” ratings from Standard and Poor’s and “Aaa” to “Baa3” ratings from Moody’s.

 Bonds with higher ratings will usually pay lower rates of interest than those with lower ratings. U.S. Treasury bonds are the most common AAA-rated bond securities.

importance of emergency funds in financial stability,Financial Goals for Students: How and Why to Set Them,Setting financial goals can help students get a head start in life. Here are some of the best financial goals and how to set—and achieve—them.,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-goals-for-students-7151682,"With some background knowledge and financial education, a student can set up the groundwork for a successful financial future or even financial independence. Often, this right financial start requires a road map. Understanding how to set financial goals, and the types of goals to reach for, can help students create that road map and keep them on track.
Let’s take a look at financial goals, how to set them, and ways to increase the chances of success down the road.
A financial goal is a money objective that you hope to achieve. This might be to build a million-dollar nest egg or save enough for a week-long trip next year. Your financial goals can help guide you as you build up savings, decide to invest, or become debt free. Your financial goals are milestones on the road map to living the kind of life you want.
Setting financial goals early can help establish effective money habits that can provide you with a greater chance of achieving financial well-being later in life. Plus, the earlier you start setting goals like saving and investing, the more money you’re likely to have when it’s time to retire.
As you set financial goals, consider the three main types of goals, which can be broken down by time frame:
Be realistic about what you hope to accomplish and a potential time line.

When setting financial goals, Alissa Krasner Maizes, the founder of Amplify My Wealth, and a licensed attorney and registered investment advisor, suggests that you start with your values.
“Your list of what you value most can guide you in making the best decisions for you, making you more successful at reaching your goals,” Maizes says. “Next, decide what financial goals you want to achieve that align with your values, starting with smaller achievable and measurable goals that you can track, knowing you can always revisit and tweak them.”
Here are some potential goals for students.
Your budget helps you visualize your income and expenses. No mater how much money you have on hand to start with, outlining what you have, spend, and save (where applicable) is essential. You can use your budget to see how much money is coming in and list your most common costs.
“Creating a budget is an essential step toward financial stability,” Markia Brown, a Certified Financial Education Instructor and Registered Financial Associate at The Money Plug LLC, said. “It helps you track your income and expenses, prioritize your spending, and identify areas where you can cut back. It’s a short-term goal that you can achieve within a few hours or days.”
Brown suggests listing all sources of income and then reviewing your spending. Then, she recommends determining whether your expenses are needs or wants. This can help you determine what to cut back on when things get tight. It can also help you figure out how much money to direct toward other goals, such as paying off debt or saving for retirement.
“Review and adjust your budget regularly to reflect changes in your income and expenses,” Brown says.

Build a habit of saving now, and you’ll feel more comfortable with it later. Brown points out that many financial institutions will let you start an account with as little as $5 or $10. Set up recurring transfers so that money automatically goes into your savings account. Even $5 a week can help you start a good savings habit.
“Although opening a savings account is usually as easy as going online and entering your information, first consider whether you prefer a brick-and-mortar location near school,” Maizes said. “Consider the interest rate they will pay you for money in your account, or whether they have student accounts offering bonuses, fewer fees, no ATM fees, and lower minimums.”
Compare two to four choices and choose an account that works with your lifestyle.
No matter how much money you make, investing for retirement can be a major goal for you, according to Jeff DeMaso, Chartered Financial Analyst, a former portfolio manager, and editor and founder of The Independent Vanguard Adviser.
“Compounding may be the eighth wonder of the world, but it takes time to see the results,” DeMaso said. “So, you want to start investing as early as possible, even if you are starting out small.”
If you have an employer that offers a plan, such as a 401(k), have a portion of your paycheck deducted each period and set aside for the future. You can also open a roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), Maizes points out. With this approach, you can take advantage of your current low tax rate to start building a nest egg for the future.  
DeMaso recommends looking for low-cost index funds and making sure you automatically invest, whether you’re using an employer-sponsored plan or opening your own account. Over time, as your income increases, boost the amount of money you set aside in your retirement account.
Maizes points out that an emergency fund can help you prepare to live independently, once you finish school. You might have help from your parents or some other source, such as scholarships and grants, to cover most costs. Once you graduate, though, dealing with unexpected costs can be more difficult.
Starting an emergency fund today can help you build over time. Similar to a savings account, an emergency fund can be started with just a few dollars. Consider setting a goal to eventually save at least six months’ worth of expenses. Start small, with perhaps $10 a week, and then increase as your income and financial situation improves.
“Your emergency fund is your safety net in the event you ever run out of money,” Maizes said. “An emergency fund is an excellent lifetime goal whether you are a student or not.”
Student loan debt can feel like a millstone when you graduate. Maizes suggests investigating scholarships and grants to reduce what you borrow.
“Consider applying for scholarships and grants that do not mandate you to pay back any money,” Maizes said. “These opportunities are open to students to apply for within and outside your school throughout your educational journey.”
If you go to a higher education institution, consult with your financial aid office and your academic department head to find out what’s available. Fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year to determine what aid you might qualify for.
You can also look for opportunities through federal work-study programs to earn money for expenses, rather than using student loan debt.

As a student and young adult, building credit as soon as you can is recommended.
“You’ll need a loan to buy a new car or house,” DeMaso said. “Your credit score will impact the interest rate you have to pay for those loans. So start building a good credit history now.”
One of the easiest ways to build credit is by getting and using a credit card. Choose one or two items to pay for with your credit card, and pay off the balance each month. Use your credit card as part of your regular spending plan, and make sure you only buy what you can afford.
DeMaso warns that the high interest rate charged by a credit card can hold you back. Use your card strategically so that you aren’t losing ground to debt.
Finally, even if you need some debt to accomplish your education goals, try to use as little as possible.
“Finding another way to make money towards your expenses can also go a long way, from tutoring, internships, dog walking, babysitting, and retail,” Maizes said.
Once you finish school, Maizes recommends putting together a debt repayment plan that can help you tackle any debt you have as quickly as possible. The most efficient approach is to order your debts from highest interest rate to lowest and put extra money toward the first debt while maintaining minimum payments on others. As you pay off each debt, you can add that extra payment to the next item on your list.
This might be a medium- to long-term goal, depending on how much debt you have and your ability to put extra money toward reducing your debt when you get your first job after graduation. However, you can still put some money toward other goals, even as you attempt to reduce your debt.
It’s never too early to have a plan for your money. In fact, establishing good financial habits now and learning how to set financial goals can help set you up for a better financial future. However, while it's important to set financial goals, creating a financial path for oneself does not guarantee a successful financial future, rather it's a stepping stone in the right direction.
As you set financial goals and work toward success, Maizes suggests celebrating your milestones and recognizing how far you’ve come.
“Whether you have extra money each month or not, celebrate being mindful of your money,” Maizes said. “This is a huge accomplishment. These steps will always serve you well and help you make better decisions with your money.”"
effective debt repayment techniques 2023,The Effects of Fiscal Deficits on an Economy,Learn about the real impact of budget deficits on the economy and see why government financing reduces private financing.,https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021015/what-effect-fiscal-deficit-economy.asp,"Fiscal deficits arise whenever a government spends more money than it brings in during the fiscal year. This imbalance is common among global economies. Between 1970 and 2022, the U.S. government has had higher expenditures than revenues for all but four years.
1
 As of September 2023, the U.S. national deficit was $1.52 trillion.
2
Keynesian macroeconomics, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes, promotes spending to drive economic activity and stimulate a slumping economy by running large deficits.
3
The first American deficit plan was conceived and executed in 1789 by Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury.
4
 Hamilton saw deficits as a means of asserting government influence, similar to how war bonds helped Great Britain out-finance France during 18th-century conflicts.
5
Economists and policy analysts disagree about the impact of fiscal deficits on the economy. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has suggested that the sluggish recovery from the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the reluctance of Congress to run deficits to boost the economy.
6
Others argue that budget deficits crowd out private borrowing, manipulate capital structures and interest rates, decrease net exports, and lead to either higher taxes, higher inflation, or both.
Until the early 20th century, most economists and government advisers favored balanced budgets or budget surpluses. The Keynesian revolution advocated a countercyclical fiscal policy during periods of economic woe. During such times, the government uses deficit spending to make up for the decline in investment and boost consumer spending to stabilize aggregate demand.
3
Since 2001, the federal government budget has run a deficit each year. Some contributing factors include:
The long-term macroeconomic impacts of fiscal deficits are subject to debate. If the deficit arises due to short-term spending projects such as infrastructure spending or business grants, these sectors commonly see a boost in operations and profitability. If the deficit increases because receipts have fallen, either through tax cuts or a decline in business activity, this activity will not usually stimulate the economy.
Politicians and policymakers rely on fiscal deficits to expand popular policies, such as welfare programs and public works. Both conservative and liberal administrations tend to run deficits in the name of tax cuts, stimulus spending, welfare, public good, infrastructure, war financing, and environmental protection.
Some economists argue against government budget deficits for crowding out private borrowing and distorting interest rates. However, fiscal deficits have remained popular among government economists since Keynes legitimized them in the 1930s. Expansionary fiscal policy forms the basis of Keynesian anti-recession techniques and provides an economic justification for spending money with reduced short-term consequences.
Deficits are financed through the sale of government securities, such as Treasury bonds (T-bonds). Individuals, businesses, and other governments purchase bonds and lend money to the government with the promise of future repayment.
Government borrowing reduces the pool of available funds that can be invested in other businesses. An individual who lends $5,000 to the government cannot use that same $5,000 to purchase the stocks or bonds of a private company. All deficits tend to reduce the potential capital stock in the economy.
The sale of government securities has a direct impact on interest rates. The interest rate paid on loans to the government represents nearly risk-free investments against which all other financial instruments must compete. If the government bonds pay 2% interest, other financial assets must pay a rate to entice buyers away from government bonds. This function is used by the Federal Reserve when it engages in open market operations to adjust interest rates within the confines of monetary policy.
There are practical, legal, theoretical, and political limitations for debt on the government's balance sheet. The U.S. government cannot fund its deficits without attracting borrowers. Backed only by the full faith and credit of the federal government, U.S. bonds and Treasury bills (T-bills) are purchased by individuals, businesses, and other governments.
The Federal Reserve also purchases bonds as part of its monetary policy procedures.
13
 Should the government ever run out of willing borrowers, there is a genuine sense that deficits would be limited and default would occur.
Total government debt has real and negative long-term consequences. If interest payments on the debt become untenable through tax-and-borrow revenue streams, the government faces three options. It can cut spending and sell assets to make payments. It can print money to cover the shortfall, or the country can default on loan obligations.

While macroeconomic proposals under the Keynesian school argue that deficits are sometimes necessary to stimulate aggregate demand, some economists claim that deficits crowd out private borrowing, distort the marketplace, and unfairly burden future generations of taxpayers."
effective debt repayment techniques 2023,Portfolio Investment: Definition and Asset Classes,"A portfolio investment is a stake in an asset bought with the expectation that it will provide income or grow in value, or both.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-investment.asp,"Portfolio investment refers to acquiring and managing an array of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities, while balancing risk and maximizing returns over time. Yet, in a nation where the path to financial security and a stable retirement often winds through what for many is a pitfall-filled maze of investment choices, most Americans report being uncomfortable and unready to tackle their portfolio investments.
A 2024 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve paints a stark picture: most Americans in the lower 90% of income earners feel adrift when managing their investment portfolios. More alarming is that two-thirds of non-retirees say they're not on track in saving for retirement.
1
 These statistics aren't just numbers; they represent millions of individuals grappling with the stress and painful choices that come with an uncertain financial future.
As such, at a time when investment news often dominates headlines and resources on learning about stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and more are just a click away, for too many, managing portfolio investments remains a vague notion rather than a practical tool.
David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, said that with many financial products on offer from so many companies and given the profound changes in the financial markets over the past half century or so, it's not hard to see why portfolio investing might seem ""opaque"" to many. ""But in reality, today it’s easier than ever to put together a diversified, low-cost portfolio for any risk profile and time horizon,"" he said. ""Resources for investors of all experience levels abound. Knowledge is power, but you don’t have to become a financial prodigy to set yourself up for long-term success.""
Thus, learning the art of constructing and managing portfolio investments isn't just a skill for finance professionals; it's almost a necessity for anyone hoping to build long-term financial security, given the vast changeover since the early 1980s from defined pension plans to 401(k)s and the like for retirement planning.
As Tenerelli noted, you don't need to go it alone. ""Working with an advisor can help investors avoid pitfalls and approach optimization while integrating their investment planning with the rest of their financial situation, such as tax planning, estate planning, insurance/risk analysis, and so on."" Still, knowing how portfolio investing works is a benefit, whether you're a do-it-yourselfer or someone who feels better handing off your financials to professionals.
The ability to effectively choose investments for your portfolio can be the defining factor between a future marked by financial anxiety and one characterized by stability and relative comfort. As market complexities grow and traditional investment wisdom faces unprecedented challenges, understanding portfolio investment is critical and rewarding. Below, we'll explore the core principles of portfolio investment, clarify the main asset classes you'll be choosing from, and provide actionable insights from Tenerelli and others that can help you build and manage a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance—no matter your financial experience.

Portfolio investment involves assembling a collection of financial assets with the goal of achieving specific financial goals while managing risk. This approach recognizes that different assets perform differently under various economic conditions, and some have greater risks with a greater potential for rewards than others.
Portfolio investments come from a range of asset classes, including stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and certificates of deposit. Your portfolio might also include more esoteric choices, including derivatives like options and futures or physical assets like real estate, commodities, and art and collectibles.
Here’s a closer look at the essential aspects of portfolio investment:
This is the process of determining how much of your portfolio to dedicate to each type of investment. This decision should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. For instance, a young professional saving for retirement might have a higher allocation to stocks for growth potential, while a retiree might lean more heavily toward bonds for income and stability.
2
Investment allocation styles for portfolio investments depend on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. These styles typically range from conservative to aggressive, with many variations between:
Each style offers a different balance of potential risk and reward, allowing investors to align their portfolios with their individual financial circumstances and objectives.

Diversification is the cornerstone of portfolio investments. By spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions, investors can cut the effect of any single asset’s poor performance on the portfolio. This strategy helps to mitigate risk and can lead to more stable returns.

""At a basic level, a diversified portfolio will probably include at least some stocks and some bonds,"" Tenerelli said. He advised those beginning with portfolio investments to look at ETFs and index or passive mutual funds, which are ""the easiest, lowest-cost way"" to assemble a portfolio that meets most people's needs. However, ""if investors wish to 'slice and dice' or 'tilt' their portfolio toward certain asset subclasses (such as small-cap value, emerging markets, etc.), or if they wish to invest in more esoteric asset classes such as derivatives or private equity, then more research is warranted.""
There are several approaches for diversifying a portfolio:
Portfolio investment involves continuously managing your risks to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. The primary tool for managing risk is diversification. This approach helps insulate the portfolio from the poor performance of any single investment or market sector.
Investors can further manage risk by regularly rebalancing their portfolios, ensuring that asset allocations remain aligned with their risk tolerance and goals despite market volatility.
Another key aspect of risk management is understanding and adjusting for your risk tolerance, which can change over time because of age, changes in finances, need for liquidity, and market conditions. This might involve gradually shifting to more conservative financial products as retirement approaches or adjusting strategies during periods of high market volatility. In addition, you can use tools like stop-loss orders to automatically sell assets if they fall below a certain price, or employ options strategies to hedge against potential losses.
10
Managing risk includes accounting for the risk-return trade-offs of each financial product. Generally, lower risk levels correspond to lower potential returns, while higher risk levels are associated with higher potential returns. Below is a chart representing the risk/return relationship with a higher risk typically related (but certainly not always) with higher potential rewards.
11


Investment horizons range from the short term—hours, days, weeks, etc.—to much longer spans, years and decades. For example, post-college professionals with a 401(k) plan would have an investment horizon of decades. Meanwhile, a day trader's horizon doesn't last beyond the trading today.
12
In general, portfolios that have a shorter time horizon should be those where investors are willing to take on less risk—such as when retirement is imminent. The longer the horizon, the greater the risks you can take since there's time for you to make up for shortfalls. Obviously, it isn't carte blanche to make the riskiest trades just because you have decades until retirement. Rather, a longer-term investor may hold what are considered riskier types of equities, such as mid-cap, small-cap, or high-growth stocks.
12
You'll need to decide whether you want to actively or passively engage with your portfolio investments. Active management involves buying and selling assets to outperform the market, often requiring extensive research and analysis. Meanwhile, passive management aims to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark, offering a cost-effective and lower-maintenance investment option. This can be quickly done by investing in a mutual fund or ETF that tracks an index of securities you want to follow, like the S&P 500 index. These are among the most popular funds to invest in.
For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is a passively managed fund for long-term investors that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fund manager simply replicates the holdings by weight of the S&P 500's large-cap stocks.

These shouldn't be left for last. Often, the type and amount of assets you'll choose for your portfolio investments will depend in part on their tax efficiency, an essential aspect of portfolio investing. Different assets and accounts are subject to varying tax treatments, which can greatly impact your returns in the long run. Using tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize tax liabilities and increase your after-tax returns.
13


Asset classes are sets of investments that share similar characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. Here are the most commonly traded:
Equities represent ownership in a company and are typically traded on stock exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Investors can earn returns from equities in two primary ways: capital appreciation (increases in the stock price) and dividends (periodic payments to shareholders).
There are two main types of equities:
While generally considered riskier than other asset classes, stocks can deliver higher returns over the long term. Their performance is influenced by company performance, market conditions, and broader economic trends.
Fixed-income securities are investments that provide returns through regular interest payments and the return of principal at maturity. These securities have several features:
Bonds play a crucial role in many portfolio investments, providing income stability and often serving as a counterbalance to the higher volatility of stocks. However, investors should consider interest rate and credit risks, as well as the potential impact of inflation when incorporating bonds into portfolio investments.
Cash and cash equivalents form a crucial component of many portfolios, offering stability and liquidity. This asset class includes cash, bank deposits, money market funds, short-term government securities (e.g., Treasury bills), and highly liquid, short-term debt instruments.
These assets are characterized by their high liquidity, meaning they can be quickly converted to cash with little to no loss of value. They typically offer lower returns than stocks or bonds but provide a safety net and ready funds for immediate needs or investment prospects.
While cash and cash equivalents offer stability and liquidity, they don't necessarily keep pace with inflation over the long term. Holding onto these assets often results in a gradual erosion of purchasing power. Therefore, investors usually need to balance liquidity and safety with higher-yielding investments to achieve their long-term financial goals.
16
Alternative portfolio investments are a broad category for assets that fall outside the traditional list of stocks, bonds, and cash. Many alternative investments have low liquidity, meaning they can be difficult to buy or sell quickly. They are also often associated with higher potential returns but also higher risk and can require far greater kinds of knowledge or expertise.
Real estate investing involves buying, owning, managing, selling, or financing real estate properties to generate profit. Real estate investments fall into two main categories:
Real estate can generate income through rent and can appreciate in the long term. However, it also comes with risks such as market fluctuations. Property values and income are often greatly affected by changes in the overall economy, interest rates, and local market conditions. Maintenance costs, vacancies, and liquidity risks are all risks that come with investing in real estate.
Commodities are the oldest traded goods, typically raw materials or agricultural products traded either OTC or on exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade. Common examples include precious metals (gold, silver, copper), energy resources (oil, natural gas), agricultural products (wheat, corn, livestock), and industrial metals (copper, aluminum).
These investments offer several features:
Investors can gain exposure to commodities through direct ownership (owning the physical goods), futures contracts (whose value is based on their expected value), commodity-linked ETFs and mutual funds, and shares in commodity-producing companies.
While commodities can offer portfolio diversification and potential inflation protection, they also come with unique risks, including storage costs for physical commodities, complex pricing, and high sensitivity to global economic and political events.

Besides real estate and commodities, lists of alternative portfolio investments typically include the following:
Suppose you have $100,000 to invest. You decide to build a diversified portfolio with the following asset allocation:
60% Stocks
35% Bonds
5% REIT shares
The portfolio is designed to provide exposure to various asset classes with different risk and return characteristics. The bulk goes to stocks for growth potential, with a significant portion in U.S. large-cap firms for stability. Bonds provide income and help mitigate overall portfolio risk, while REITs offer exposure to the real estate market.
The initial investment of $100,000 meets its target percentages. As the markets move, however, the portfolio investment allocations will shift. For example, if stocks have a strong year, the equity portion may grow to 65% of the portfolio.
To maintain the intended risk profile, you must periodically rebalance your portfolio by selling portions of the outperforming assets and using the proceeds to buy underperforming assets. This way, you can return the allocation to the original 60% stock / 35% bond / 5% REIT mix.
In the long term, you'll generate returns (or losses) that blend the returns of the individual asset classes. This diversification helps smooth out volatility compared with investing in one asset class or another.
Portfolio investments involve acquiring diverse financial assets to generate returns over time, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. By diversifying across different asset classes, investors can mitigate risk and potentially improve their returns, as various assets often respond differently to changing market conditions.
A key part of successful portfolio investing is understanding each asset class, including their risk profiles, liquidity, and correlations with one another. This allows you to build a balanced portfolio better tailored to your financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio is essential to ensure it remains aligned with your goals while adapting to changes in your finances and the broader economic world. By following these principles, you can better position yourself for long-term portfolio investment success while addressing the inherent uncertainties of financial markets.

mindset shifts for improving financial health,How To Achieve Financial Independence,"Before you can achieve financial independence, you have to figure out what it means to you. Here's how to set financial independence goals and achieve them, whether you want to retire early, live abroad, or reduce stress.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-achieve-financial-independence-8647093,"A growing number of women say that achieving financial independence is their No. 1 financial goal, according to a Fidelity Investments Survey. Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money.
1
However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense. 
Whether you're hoping to go full FIRE (financial independence, retire early) or just want to feel more on top of your expenses and planning, this guide will offer practical steps to get you where you want to go. 
“Financial independence means different things to different people,” says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. “Some see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.” 
Russell continues, “For some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.”
No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences.
At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. 
For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less—even with three kids in tow. 
“[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,"" says Brock Waterman. 
After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. 
Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. 
While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer.
Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans.
“Investing 10-15% of gross income for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,” says Anna N’Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence.  
While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings.
Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too.
“Many financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,” she says.
Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. “When we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,” he says. 
After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care.  
Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal.
Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don’t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don’t.
For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. 
“They'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,” Waterman explains. 
Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. 
“Focus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,” he advises. “High-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent financial management and investment strategies.” 
Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul.
While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities.
According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350.
2
While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. 
The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,  life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women
3
 in the United States and 74 years for men.
4
 This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. 
According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man.
5
 Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs.
“With added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,” Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents.
A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000.
6
 Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments, lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men.
Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers.
7
 So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. 
Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey.
Defining your ""why"" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path.
Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence.
To assess your current financial situation: 
Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages.
To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning.
Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time.
Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number—an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions.
To determine this:
Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target.
“For individuals aspiring to achieve financial independence through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,” says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.” 
Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth. “Rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with financial goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to financial independence,” he adds.
He says investing may require the help of a team—a financial advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney—whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner.
Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn’t derail the dream. 
“Achieving financial independence while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,” says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between “good” debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and ""bad"" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. 
Russell says, “Prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance financial security and accelerate the journey to independence.”
To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods:
Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid.
Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts.
Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first.
Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress.
Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free.
Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit.
Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap.
9
 Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. 
Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms.
Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. 
As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages:
Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow.
Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they’re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for.
“You can be very ruthless … don't spend money if it's not important to you,” says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? 
For the Watermans, traveling isn’t a luxury. It’s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper “why” and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans.
Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades.
Read personal finance books, listen to financial independence podcasts, attend investment seminars, and join money-minded online communities. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will teach you new, useful skillsets, rather than discourage you from reaching for your goals. 
Also, work with a financial advisor—a fiduciary who crafts a holistic plan for you. Their expertise navigates optimized outcomes not possible alone. Investment pros protect wealth too —steering you away from emotional decision pitfalls novice investors succumb to.
The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There’s more than one way to do this.
“I think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,” advises Konte. “In my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.” 
Russell reiterates that “while a high income can expedite financial independence, it's not a prerequisite.” Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families.
Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

mindset shifts for improving financial health,The Financial Advisor Profession Still Lacks Diversity,The financial advisory industry remains overwhelmingly white and male but efforts to recruit minorities and women are slowly bearing fruit.,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-advisor/fa-profession-accountable-lack-diversity/,"In a nation at times grappling with, at others neglecting, persistent income disparities across gender, ethnic, and racial lines, the demographics of financial advisors starkly reflect these broader economic inequalities.
The financial planning industry has always been overwhelmingly white and male, and for some time industry leaders have known that a more inclusive approach to hiring could gain them more clients among women and minorities. Yet, industry data still raises important questions about representation, access, and trust in financial services. Below, we'll dig into the implications for clients and the industry.
The disparities among financial advisors, still about 80% white, may be unsurprising given the well-documented income gaps and low representation of women and minorities in fields related to economics and mathematics.
1
 Careers that blend ""wealth management"" with a quantitative background, such as financial advising, perhaps inevitably mirror these broader societal disparities.
However, that could lead some to shrug their shoulders, point to structural factors, and dismiss the need to address long-term problems in a profession that was 95% white into the early 2000s. Linda Friedman, a civil rights attorney at Stowell and Friedman Ltd., who has handled cases resulting in hundreds of millions in settlements in the industry, parroted what she said is a standard industry response to questions about industry demographics: ""It's not our fault. It's society's fault,"" she told NPR's ""Planet Money"" in 2023. ""We're in the business of making money. And so we look for customers who have money, and it's not our fault if there's a wealth disparity in this country.""
2
That response would fail to explain why other financial service professions are more diverse, even as those have been under investigation by Congress and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a lack of diversity for years—a telling sign if the numbers for financial advising are worse.
3
4
5
Worse than offering the view that nothing is to be done because the issues are societal would be to perpetuate these inequalities. Taking women as an example, a quick review of not-long-ago industry articles would reveal a 2006 Journal of Financial Planning piece titled ""How to Help Older Divorcing Women Avoid the Bag Lady Blues,"" which has a first sentence that improbably claims millions of women were yelling, ""I don't want to be a bag lady!"" across the U.S.—an image that at once makes a cartoon of homelessness and the plight of gender inequality. Other problematic articles of the period depicted ""the dynamics of women"" (as if they were a monolith) as ""frozen in headlights,"" with the male authors downplaying the extensive social scientific literature on gender-based income inequality as merely an outcome of time off from work ""due to pregnancy, child care, and caregiving.""
6
7


It was thus no surprise that news articles more than two decades ago were premised on an ""urgent need for greater diversity"" among financial advisors. ""Our profession is very late in coming to grips with the need to increase diversity,"" said Connie Chen, a certified financial planner (CFP) and former president of the International Association for Financial Planning, in a 2002 article.
8
 Given the current demographic data, we hear similar refrains in recent years. This distressing historical echo suggests a stubborn lack of progress despite a long-standing awareness of the problem.

As of 2024, Hispanic or Latino CFPs accounted for only 3.1% of the industry total, with Asian or Pacific Islanders and Black planners at 4.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The chart below tabulates the data for CFPs, as well as personal financial advisors overall, who show slightly more diversity, though the numbers still fall well short of representative of the U.S. population.
1
Kimberly Foss, founder and president of Empyrion Wealth Management in Roseville, California, told Investopedia that the lack of diversity in the financial services industry is a central issue for the sector to face because it skews practices and norms away from the realities of the larger society.
“If we want a body of professionals who can understand and empathize with a changing American society and culture,” Foss said, recruiting underrepresented groups in far greater numbers is critical.
There are other changes afoot in the financial industry, suggesting a time of job growth when such changes are more workable given the hiring slots available:
There's been a significant rise in non-retirement investing among nonwhite adults, according to a 2024 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) report, ""Investors of Color in the United States.""
14
 Since 2015, there has been a 9% increase in the number of Black investors, a 6% increase among Hispanic or Latino investors, and a 7% point increase among Asian or Pacific Islander investors. By contrast, the percentage of white investors remained relatively stable during this period.
These new investors of color tend to be younger, with almost half of Black (49%) and Hispanic/Latino (45%) investors under 35 years old, compared with only 28% of white investors. The FINRA study shows that Black and Hispanic or Latino investors generally have smaller non-retirement portfolios, with the majority (59% for both groups) holding less than $50,000 in investments, compared with only about a third of white investors. In addition, about half of Black and 38% of Hispanic or Latino investors have less than two years of investing experience, while almost six in 10 white investors have been investing for 10 years or more.
In short, there is a greater need among these demographics for financial advisors.
Chloe McKenzie, founder and CEO of BlackFem, Inc., a nonprofit focused on creating opportunities for women and girls of color, told Investopedia that the industry has a problem that feeds on itself. Women and underrepresented groups are more reluctant to seek professional financial advice because they can’t readily find advisors they identify with. Meanwhile, a mistrust of the industry keeps women and racial minorities from entering the field to serve the groups who could directly benefit from their advice.
15

14
“The lack of diversity is hugely problematic for women and minorities seeking financial advice for a multitude of reasons, the two most prominent being comfort and respect,” Winkfield said. “Because of the boys’ club, a members-only power structure, and the inherent issues that come with it, those who do not belong in looks or gender are often intimidated or uncomfortable with their advisor options when seeking advice.”

FINRA's 2024 report and similar studies find a longstanding distrust among women and people of color toward financial professionals. ""First, they're not in our neighborhoods, with the perception that we don't have the capital, we don't have the money to invest,"" a Black male focus group participant told FINRA researchers. ""And there's also the perception from us that you need thousands of dollars to even do business with them,""
14
This has led to frustration within different communities about a lack of representation in the financial advisory industry. Janna Hurd, a market developer at Thrivent, pointed out the meager percentage of Black financial planners and advisors. ""That means Black Americans are having some of their most important conversations with professionals who don't share a similar background,"" she wrote in a 2024 Financial Planning piece.
16


This can stifle their ability to grow wealth, potentially widening the wealth gap. ""Advisors are ... there for some of life's milestones, such as buying a home, having a baby, or entering retirement,"" Hurd wrote. ""Because this client-financial advisor relationship is so much more than a series of professional transactions, the right fit has to be there as well—and for many in the Black community, that fit can be hard to see across the table.""
The disparities are also detrimental to the advisory industry itself.
“When people aren’t able to find an advisor they connect with, they get discouraged and procrastinate or start looking elsewhere for guidance,” Ande Frazier, former vice president of distribution at Penn Mutual, told Investopedia. “They’re turning to robo-advisors, the internet, or their family members and friends for advice, therefore discounting the important role of the advisor.”
The scarcity of financial advisors from diverse backgrounds has far-reaching consequences for people of color and women, researchers argue.
15
 First, trust and empathy are key to working with financial advisors. ""If clients don’t believe they can trust you to be transparent or keep their conversations and financial details confidential, they will never do business with you. It’s really that simple,"" Valerie R. Leonard,
17
 one of Investopedia's top 100 financial advisors and CEO of EverThrive Financial Group in Birmingham, Alabama, told Investopedia about the need for trust in financial advising relationships.

A recent study of 3,500 middle-income Black women found 60% had difficulty in finding financial professionals or advisors they believed they could trust.
18
 In addition, underrepresentation contributes to a cycle of financial disparity and missed opportunities for wealth building.
""I didn't grow up with somebody teaching me how to save, teaching me how to invest,"" a Hispanic female told FINRA. ""So, to have somebody to teach me—who understands that I have zero experience with where to begin—would be helpful because it's less stigmatized, I guess, and I don't have to feel stupid asking questions.""

McKenzie, the founder of BlackFem, said these perceptions of the industry are impacting recruiting within financial advising. “I think a lot of women, people of color, and women of color are not going into the industry because there’s such a large amount of distrust of the financial sector from communities of color and from women,” she said.
Addressing this underrepresentation is crucial not just for equity but for the financial health of entire communities.

 As the financial landscape becomes increasingly complex, it's perhaps natural that many discussions in the industry circle around AI, cryptocurrencies, and other leading-edge issues in advising. However, the number interested in such investments is actually relatively small—about only 2% of Americans in 2023 used crypto to send money or buy something—especially when compared with those underserved by the financial advising community.

The financial advisory industry has faced many discrimination lawsuits in recent years, highlighting ongoing issues of racial and gender inequality. These cases have not only resulted in substantial settlements but have also shed light on the personal experiences of advisors in such circumstances.
Felicia Slaton-Young, a former Edward Jones advisor, participated in a case that resulted in a $34 million settlement in 2021. ""I didn't walk into this thinking I would walk away rich; I walked in wanting to prove that my experience wasn't a fallacy or dream,"" Slaton-Young told NPR. ""I needed to fight for my dignity back.""

Slaton-Young underscored the emotional toll of workplace discrimination beyond the financial implications. Other notable high-profile cases include the following:
While these and many other settlements in recent years have resulted in payouts in the hundreds of millions, the companies typically admit no wrongdoing as part of these agreements. This pattern of large settlements without formal admissions of guilt leaves an ambiguous message for the industry, as if discrimination lawsuits are among the costs of doing business.
Recent trends show a shift in women's engagement with investing and financial planning. Despite many positive economy-wide changes, significant challenges remain, particularly in the representation of women as financial advisors.
According to the 2024 Her Money Mindset Survey from Investopedia and REAL SIMPLE, women are increasingly taking charge of their finances. The survey found that 58% of women feel somewhat or very confident in their ability to make sound financial decisions, with this confidence increasing with age and income. In addition, 60% of women make financial decisions independently, while 40% share decision-making with someone else.
However, the survey also revealed that only 39% of women hold investments. This figure varies significantly based on age, income, and financial literacy. Women who make more than $75,000 annually are more likely to invest (58%) and hold multiple investments.
The challenges women face in the industry are not just about representation but also the workplace culture. While women have advanced in financial advising, it's been slower in some parts of the sector than in others. Personal financial advisors are about 31% women, while CFPs are still less than a quarter female. Other estimates put the total of all financial advisors at only about one in five.
28
""I have been discriminated against not only for being a woman but also for being a mother in this industry,"" Kassi M. Fetters, a CFP at Artica Financial Services in Anchorage, Alaska, told Investopedia. ""I have been the only person at a firm who had a child. No other employee had any children. I have been accused of having ‘mommy brain’ [and] have been humiliated when walked in on while breast pumping in my closed office.""
Fetters suggested this lack of representation could be creating a disconnect between advisors and female clients, potentially impacting women's—especially mothers'—comfort levels with investing and financial planning. Here are other likely outcomes of the gender imbalance in financial advising:
Despite these challenges, there are positive signs. The survey found that women are actively seeking financial knowledge, with 39% looking for financial information at least monthly. This rate is even higher (48%) for millennials and younger women.
“As women, it is crucial for us to talk more about money and investing,"" Leonard said. ""We must have empowering conversations with one another that will help bridge the gender gap and encourage our friends and the next generation to get smarter with money.”
As the industry evolves, it's clear that increasing the representation of women in financial advising isn't just about equality but simply about providing better, more comprehensive financial services that cater to the needs of each investor.

 among the top 10 of the Investopedia 100 Top Financial Advisors, is the founder of Sofia Financial in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which focuses on women 45 and over. She notes that this demographic controls a growing amount of wealth in the country. Nevertheless, the women she serves ""are overlooked and devalued in many areas of society and culture, and yet we are the ones who will continue to control a growing amount of the wealth in this country,"" McCullough said. ""To serve women well, we have to have a wider conversation that encompasses all the things in our lives that are touched by money. So we have to talk with our clients about their careers and what in life brings them fulfillment, about their families and relationships, about what makes them feel happy and secure.""
For her part, Fetters said, ""I still truly believe it is possible to have a career in the financial industry and raise a family as a female, but there is still a lot to overcome.""

Industry leaders and organizations have put in place many different strategies to attract and retain diverse talent, focusing on education, mentorship, and inclusive recruiting practices.

 Despite those efforts, recent legal and political developments have created significant new challenges.
In recent years, the financial services industry has seen a notable shift in its approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, largely in response to a changing political climate and high-profile court cases. This includes the Supreme Court's decision to ban race-based affirmative action in college admissions, which has had a ripple effect across various sectors, including major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase curtailing or retooling their diversity programs.
32
33
In addition, suits are becoming common that target programs specifically for raising up women and minorities as a form of ""reverse discrimination."" In May 2024, Citigroup was sued for alleged racial discrimination because of its policy of waiving ATM fees for customers of minority-owned banks.
34
 Meanwhile, the SEC, Nasdaq, and other major industry players are under significant scrutiny in the courts for their inclusion programs, including rules requiring board diversity disclosures.
35
36
These legal challenges and setbacks are forcing the financial industry to reassess its approach to diversity and inclusion. While some companies are scaling back their initiatives in response to legal pressures, others are seeking to promote diversity in ways that can withstand legal scrutiny.
Meanwhile, there's been a transition toward focusing on grassroots efforts and long-term strategies to build a more diverse talent pipeline and financial advising clientele from the ground up rather than relying solely on top-down diversity programs. Previous strategies have been too often up to the whims of changing corporate boards, trends, and U.S. court decisions.
Foss, the founder of Empyrion Wealth Management, said there's still a need for better and more effective mentorship programs and recruiting practices. These should target the interests and cultures of racial minorities and women. She said that an early emphasis on financial education can also boost a career in the financial services industry, so it's on the radar for women and people of color.
“We should be developing outreach programs targeting high school students, who need to know that ours is not only a viable industry but crucial for the long-term well-being of the general population,” Foss said. At the college level, expanded internship opportunities may prove critical in attracting more women and underrepresented people to the industry.
Winkfield said the challenge with these programs is ensuring they create a comfortable environment for the people they’re trying to recruit.
This is something McKenzie’s organization has focused on. Education initiatives are the focal point of BlackFem, which advances financial literacy through programs offered in elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as online workshops for parents. “We’re culturally responsive and infuse the experiences of those that we serve into our curriculum, and to top it off, we look like the constituency we serve,” McKenzie said.
These efforts can attract the interest of women and underrepresented people to advisory careers, but the financial industry must also play a part in attracting the groups that it wants to hire. Retaining diverse talent is as crucial as recruiting it. This means implementing flexible work policies, providing diversity and inclusion training, and establishing employee resource groups.
Winkfield said that encouraging diversity hinges on more than just rules and programs. Financial advising firms need to adopt a more inclusive mindset: “It’s human to gravitate toward like-looking and like-minded people, and it takes a conscious effort to seek out diversity when it’s not your normal.”

The financial advisor industry continues to grapple with a significant lack of diversity, despite increased awareness and efforts to address the issue. Recent data shows that while there has been some progress, the representation of women and people of color in the industry remains disproportionately low.
This lack of diversity not only reflects broader societal inequalities but also has far-reaching consequences for clients, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The absence of diverse advisors can lead to missed opportunities for tailored financial advice, perpetuate the wealth gap, and create a disconnect between advisors and clients from different backgrounds."
mindset shifts for improving financial health,The New Age of Financial Literacy with Kyla Scanlon,"In episode 81 of the Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver, we talk to Kyla Scanlon, a writer, investor, researcher, and financial influencer.",https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-81-5225441,"Outside of the stock market, consumers are feeling the ripple effects of rising rates. Mortgage rates on the 30-year fixed hit 4.8%. The median U.S. household now needs 34.2% of gross income to make that monthly payment, up from 29% a year ago. A five-year loan on a new car is 4.2%. That's up from 3.6% in January. And average credit card APR are ticking up as well, hitting 16.4% last week on average. That's up a little bit from January. Back inside the capital markets, the first quarter was a tough time to be a balance and diversified investor. A 60/40 portfolio, 60 stocks, 40 bonds, was down 5.3% in the first quarter. That's the bad news. The good news, according to Ryan Detrick at LPL Finance, the past five times it was down 5% or more saw pretty strong gains the following quarter. Could that be a sign of a bottoming and stabilization for U.S. markets?
Here are a couple of other reasons it could be a lot worse for equity investors. Real yields on government bonds are still negative. Real yields are what investors receive on U.S. government bonds after accounting for inflation. Despite the steep rise in Treasury yields this year, so-called real interest rates are still fairly low. For now, that is providing support for the economy and an incentive for investors to keep seeking returns in riskier assets. The yield on the five year Treasury inflation-protected securities, a benchmark gauge of real interest rates over the next half decade, clocked in at a -0.6%, according to Tradeweb. That was up from about -1.6% at the end of last year, but still well below the 1% level it reached in 2018.

Some of the smartest, most engaging content about finance and investing is happening away from traditional media outlets, don't act so surprised. We do our best around here. But over the past few years, several important new voices have emerged around the financial media bubble, and they are building large followings organically. You've heard from many of them on the Express before: Earn Your Leisure, The Wallstreet Trapper, Morgan Housel.
Well, Kyla Scanlon is another rising star in that galaxy, but she didn't just get here. She's been trading and blogging for years, but she's expanded her content platforms on Instagram, TikTok, her podcast, and her Substack, where she has hundreds of thousands of followers. You want to learn about Roblox and the creator economy? Follow Kyla. You want to understand the Fed and interest rates in a way that actually matters to the way you live. Follow Kyla. You want to know about the meaning of the metaverse? You know what to do, follow Kyla. And you know what we did? We brought Kyla onto the Express all the way from beautiful Denver, Colorado. Welcome, Kyla. So good to have you here. 
Kyla:
""Yeah. Thanks so much for having me. Super happy to be here.""
Caleb:
""Well, let's start at the very beginning (or close to it). You've been trading options and you were trading options since you were a teenager. What got you into options and how did you learn and what were your first days like when you got into the options trading universe?""
Kyla:
""So, for me, it was just something that I could do over the summer. I just really wanted to explore that because I didn't know a whole lot about money, and it seemed like a cool thing to do. So, I used tastytrade.com, and I went through a learning course and was able to trade through my broker by going through this course, right? Because you're not supposed to trade under a certain age.""
""And so, that's what I did, and I was really bad at it. Just absolutely horrendous. But I learned a lot through doing a little bit of money at it and just trying to figure out how the market worked. And so, that was my first foray into the financial universe, which I don't really recommend that people do, sort of backwards like that. But it was definitely an interesting learning experience.""
Caleb:
""Yeah, you just jumped right over equities, right over index funds and ETFs. You didn't tiptoe your way in, you jumped into the hottest part of the frying pan to do that. Were you a math person? What was it about options that got you so interested?""
Kyla:
""I mean, it was just more about like the mechanics of it. My dad would talk about it a little bit. He was kind of... dads are sort of sometimes into that kind of stuff. And so, I was like, 'This seems like a cool thing to learn about,' and I really was fascinated by it. I was never like a math brain kid. I was always a reader and a big writer. So, it wasn't that I was drawn to it because of the pure mathematics behind it but definitely found that part fascinating too."" 
Caleb:
""Well, you started blogging about your trading, which really set the foundation for all the content you're producing today. How would you describe what you do today? What do you do?""

Kyla:
""So, I mean, I guess like a brief background on the blog: I started that back in college. So, a blog on options trading, it was called Scanlon on Stocks. And I wrote for Seeking Alpha in college and sort of had to stop all that once I worked for Capital Group after I graduated school, but kept up the blog in the meantime.""
""So now, how I describe what I do is... sort of a synthesizer, a curator. I don't really like saying 'content creator,' which I think is how most people would describe me. But I have a Substack that I publish once a week, and I talk about everything from wheat prices to oil prices to the Fed's decisions. And then I have a daily TikTok where I try to break down different concepts around, like, the yield curve or what Brainard spoke about—one of the members of the Federal Reserve. And then I also have a YouTube channel where I do longer-form videos on the stock market. And then I also do a lot of different things on Twitter, on Instagram and then TikTok. So, just try to be everywhere. I have a podcast as well. That's basically my clipped audio.""
""The main goal is just to help more people understand what's going on in the financial universe and to break it down in such an interesting way, or hopefully interesting way, hopefully unique way because I feel like there's not enough art made about finance, and hopefully that's something that I'm helping to to fill the gap in.""
Caleb:
""Hey, man, we're birds of a feather there. I'm an art major who turned into the editor in chief of Investopedia, so I got no business being here either, but I try to do some storytelling around it. So, you're a puzzle solver also. You're curious. What piques your curiosity these days about investor behavior, especially over the past year or so? It's been a very strange time.""
Kyla:
""How much time do you have? I feel like we could talk forever about all the weird stuff that's happening. I think the meme stocks are really interesting to me, and especially now that they're upticking again. I found this safe-haven thesis around meme stocks, where people seem to be going towards them in times of uncertainty because they're like, 'These seem safe and good,' and that's a really confusing to me. I don't quite understand the whole GME, AMC interest. So, I think that's something that's interesting.""
""And then also just how the stock market is responding to this broader uncertainty narrative. It seems like everything the Fed says the stock market is like... and it needs to go up. And so the big question for me is, is there a bubble? And is the bubble going to pop or is it just kind of chug along like this for the next little bit?""
Caleb:
""Let's talk about consumers because I know you write a lot about them. U.S. consumers, since you and I are among them... Americans love to spend, Kyla, you know that. We've been doing a pretty good job of it, even amid raging inflation. As a market and economic philosopher, if you will, what is it about our spending resiliency that fascinates you?""
Kyla:
""I think a lot of people try to compare this to 2008, and I do think that you have a different consumer. Wage growth hasn't matched inflation, right? But most consumers theoretically are better off than they were previously. So, I think that people are pretty resilient, as you said, right now. You see people spending on cruises, they're still planning on vacations. There doesn't seem to be a big pullback in the amount of spending that the consumer is doing.""
""And I think, broadly speaking, the consumer is relatively healthy. You see that in the applications for houses, even though those applications have gone down because mortgage rates have gone up. But you do see better creditworthiness from housing applicants. So, I think that consumers are just out there to spend. I'm not sure if... this is something I've also been thinking about: is it a sense of financial nihilism, where it's kind of like, 'I just have to spend money and this is just how it is?' Or do consumers actually have this excess savings? The savings rate has declined, but it's not terrible. People are doing relatively OK, but are they doing super OK? I don't think so.""
Caleb:
""I don't either. I do think there are some revenge spending going on out there. You can't deny that. I'm guilty of it as well.""
Kyla:
""What I have noticed that people really like to have nice things. I think that we have this sort of like showy, social media society. And if you want to keep up with the Joneses, and literally everybody is the Joneses right now, you kind of have to spend because we're just so chronically online. So, I think that that's a driving force of that as well.""
Caleb:
""Guilty as charged as well. I know I've done some of that too, but these sometimes do not end very well. Kyla, we're in April, which is Financial Literacy Month around these parts. Although at Investopedia, and on your blog and on your TikTok, it's always Financial Literacy Month, but you've written about how we need to pare down financial literacy and improve it, not expand it. What's wrong with financial literacy today? What are you doing to try to change it?""
Kyla:
""I think it is Simon... that said this is about financial literacy, that maybe we should think about what we can make better versus trying to add more things to it. So, the way that I think about it is it has to be almost entertaining. And that's not the best thing ever to say because our brains already melting because of TikTok. But I think that you have to make stuff a little bit more engaging, and you have to make it applicable.""
""So, the way that I think about it is, 'If I can get people to pay attention,' and the way that you get people to pay attention is by making fun of something or memeifying it a little bit, then you can send them down a rabbit hole. So, my goal right now is to be a little bit more top of funnel for people. And then if they show interest in different concepts, hopefully they'll look that stuff up. Ideally, as I continue to build out my own financial education concept and company, the goal would be to sort of take... not necessarily gamify it, but just think about how we can have people apply these concepts into things that they already know about, right? So, how can you sort of build your financial model of the world in your head relative to things that you already do?""
""So, everybody goes and spends money at Starbucks or Costco or whatever. And I think if people were able to see the path of how the money that they spend at Starbucks or Costco sort of reverberates down the Costco & Starbucks supply chains... So, you spend money on a coffee, that coffee was made with beans, that money pays a worker, the money pays for the beans, and then all of that goes up into corporate headquarters, all that stuff. I think that we need to do more visualization around the systems that we exist in because everybody is an economic entity.""
""And I think that the biggest issue with financial literacy is that we oftentimes treat people as like, 'Oh, this is something that's separate than you and is optional for you to learn about.' But really, you're part of it, right? And so, I think we just have to make people feel more welcomed, and the way that you can do that is be like, 'Hey, you're you're doing it. You're already doing it. Just... here's some extra knowledge about what you are already doing.'""
Caleb:
""You're a market participant or you're an economic participant, whether you know it or not. And the two key things people don't like talking about, as you know, Kyla: their health and their money. But those are kind of the two things that stress us out the most or that can have the biggest impact on our life. So, I love what you're doing. I can't wait to see what you're building. You started trading options at a pretty young age. You jumped right into the hot part of the frying pan, as I said. What attracted you to options and what have you learned by trading that has helped you in other aspects of your life?""
Kyla:
""Yeah. I mean, I think for me it was just confusing. So, grew up in Kentucky, I was fascinated by the idea of getting out of Kentucky. Figured that if I understood the concept of money that, ideally, I could sort of build a path out of there. And with options, I was more fascinated by what it meant relative to the Greeks and things like that. So, 'What does a delta mean? What does a gamma mean? How does all of that work?'""
""There's so much mechanical math sometimes behind finance that's... and finance, like a stock, you can sometimes see it as something that like doesn't make sense. Like, why is Tesla going up? Who knows? But like Tesla's options market is so much more mechanical, and it like makes so much more sense because it has to. So, I think what was sort of interesting to me was the how it all interacted. The ecosystem of the options market was really, really fascinating.""
Caleb:
""We just wrapped up our Financial Literacy Survey, we've put it out there for folks to see. One of the things it shows, Kyla, is that 30% of Gen Z and millennials own cryptocurrency, and a large percentage of them are counting on crypto to help fund their retirement, and they're planning on retiring younger than older generations now. This is a big generalization. It's a big survey that we did. But what's your reaction to that?""
Kyla:
""Wow. I mean, no, that's great. I own crypto. Huge fan of crypto in some aspects. Definitely have qualms with it too, which I think it's healthy to not have a balanced take on things like that. But that's good. I think that Gen Z, which I'm like an older Gen Z... I think that it's good that they're interested in crypto because it's going to be the future of something, right? I think it has a big part of how we think about future interactions, the future of money. I do think that if the Fed ever figures out the CBDC situation, that would be really beneficial. And I think that there's a lot that they can learn from the crypto universe from that.""
""With regards to retiring, that's something I have a little bit of a thing with because I think a lot of people see crypto as a way to get rich quick, which sure, a lot of people have. But I also think that is not the healthiest mindset to have with certain things. And that might sound preachy, but I just think that if you're going into something to try and make a lot of money off of it, you oftentimes miss the beauty of it. And then if you don't get rich, you get frustrated, and then you just end up like washing your hands entirely of the situation. So, not the biggest fan of that concept. I'm not sure if that's what they meant. But I do think it's very exciting that there's interest and people are purchasing crypto.""
Caleb:
""There's a lot of interest. It's one of our most popular subjects here at Investopedia, we get questions about it all the time, and we're constantly learning about it too. But I don't disagree with you. In some form or another, digital currency is our future. And maybe the Fed here needs to take a field trip over to El Salvador and see how things are going there now that they made it legal tender. So, it's so fascinating. Which investors, Kyla, or economists or financial influencers influence you?""
Kyla:

""A lot of people! A lot of people on Twitter I've just learn so much from. I was having a conversation, which is crazy, with the Odd Lots podcast. So, Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal, and we were just chatting a little bit in the comments on Twitter, and they're a huge influence to me. I think they do a great job breaking down macroeconomic concepts, and they're always so on the ball with like everything that they talk about, and I just learned a ton from them.""
""And then Corey Hoffstein, I think that's how you say his last name. He's really great. Then Ben, who specializes in volatility. The whole indie ETF crew... The guys over at ETF Exchange. All those people, I learned a ton from. The Roundhill crew. I mean, there's so many people. And then fellow finance creators, I learned a ton from Kayla Kilbride... and Dan Toomey. We all have like a little group chat where we talk about stuff. And so, that's really helpful. And yeah, but I would say Twitter is where I learn the most, and then I am able to have a lot of different threads going on there. Not in terms of who I'm talking to, but just different people that I read, so I can't even name them all. So, I'm so lucky because of that. There's so many people, which is which is great.""
Caleb:
""Yeah, I hear you. And folks, we're going to list some of those folks in the show notes here, but I follow some of the same people, and I'll tell you what, Twitter takes its knocks for some things. One thing it's really good at is connecting the financial community. The FinTwit community is amazing. That's how Kyle and I know each other, and that's how I know a lot of the friends that I've met over the years. So, valuable. Kyla, let's do a lightning round. Three questions, quick questions. Ten second responses each, shoot right from the hip. No time to think. I'm just going to blast you, and you blast right back. Are you ready?""
Kyla:
""Yeah, I hope so!""
Caleb:
""Me too. Elon Musk and Twitter. Ten-second reaction.""
Kyla:
""Oh, that's... he refiled his form. That SCC division of Elon Musk I'm sure is super happy with them right now.""
Caleb:
""I think you're absolutely right. He and the SCC just love each other. They're getting together for the holidays. I can't wait to be there for that. AMC Entertainment buys a gold mine. Your reaction?""
Kyla:
""Berkshire Hathaway of meme stocks.""
Caleb:
""Great one. And I will be with the Berkshire Hathaway crew in early May for their annual meeting. We're going to want to talk to them about that as well. OK, last one. Since you mentioned Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger?
Kyla:
""They keep on going. I'm impressed. Longevity.""
Caleb:
""Absolutely. Longevity in their 90s, still doing the thing and doesn't seem like they're ever going to slow down. I'm looking forward to seeing them next month. All right, Kyla, you know that we are a site built on our investing terms. So many people come to us to learn about those terms and find definitions for stuff. What's your favorite investing term and why? What's the one that speaks to your soul?""
Kyla:
""Oh gosh, I mean, right? The first thing that came to mind immediately, it was inflation, right? So, decline in purchasing power. I think that's a misunderstood one almost. and it's so important. I think that there was a survey that came out saying that that's the thing that people worry the most about. And I think that a lot of people don't even fundamentally understand what it means. So that's probably my favorite definition, and I go to the Investopedia page a lot to read about it. So, yeah, that's my favorite one.""
Caleb:
""You're the one. Thanks for coming by there. We appreciate that.""
Kyla:
""I'm the clicks, yeah!""
Caleb:

""That's a lot of clicks. you must be on that page a lot, so we appreciate that. But I hear you, that is term of the moment right now. In our latest Sentiment Survey, that is issue number one, concern number one. And a lot of the other things that are going on are contributing to inflation. So, no matter what, you can't get away from it. Such a pleasure to meet you, Kyla Scanlon. Folks, follow her, kylascan on TikTok, Kyla Scanlan everywhere else, on Instagram, on Twitter. Check out the Substack, there are so many interesting articles and things to read about there. I just kept going through it and kept finding things that piqued my interest. Really good to meet you, and thanks so much for joining the Express.""
Kyla:
""Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.""
It's terminology time. Time for us to get smart with the investing term we need to know this week. And this week's term comes to us from Pat in Chillicothe, Illinois, right there on the Illinois River in lovely Peoria County. Pat suggests Treasury inflation-protected bonds or securities. We like to call them TIPS around here. TIPS are a type of Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government. TIPS are indexed to inflation in order to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money. As inflation rises, rather than their yields increasing, TIPS instead adjust in price the principal amount in order to maintain their real value.
Heading into 2022, funds focused on Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, as we call them, were among the top performing asset classes as worries about inflation surged. Then, as the Federal Reserve shifted into inflation fighting mode, those fears began to fade and TIPS performance cooled down too. But then Russia invaded Ukraine, sending energy and other commodity prices soaring. That drove investors back into TIPS to offset losses elsewhere in the bond market. Since February 10, the average inflation-protected bond has risen 1.2%, while the average intermediate core bond fund has fallen nearly 4%. TIPS generally outperform normal Treasury securities when inflation is trending higher than expected. If inflation starts to cool, given rising interest rates, TIPS should follow. Good suggestion, Pat. We're sending you some silky smooth Investopedia socks for your next walk along the Illinois River."
