Transcript

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Ann Garcia. Ann is a certified financial planner. She’s also the author of the book How to Pay for College. She’s the managing partner of Independent Progressive Advisors, a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor in Portland, Oregon. And she’s also the author of The College Financial Lady blog. She received her BA from the University of California, Berkeley.

Ann, welcome to The Long View.

Ann Garcia: Thank you for having me.

Benz: Thanks for being here. We want to talk about your book, How to Pay for College. In the book, you relate an experience from your advice practice. You were working with an attorney. She wanted to change to a less stressful career path, but she couldn’t because she owed massive amounts of student debt. Can you discuss how that was one of the events that sparked your interest in wanting to focus on helping people make smarter decisions about paying for college and other types of higher education?

Garcia: I would say, she was an extreme example of people that I was talking with. But at the time that I had the conversation with her, and this was a woman who had gone to law school, she had taken out student loans for her undergraduate years, taken out student loans for her grad school years, she had federal loans, she had private loans, and she had even borrowed money from her family. And was really not happy as an attorney and wanted to make a career change, but she was absolutely stuck because of all of those loans. And like I said, she was an extreme example of someone I worked with. And ultimately, our plan was around planning for future insolvency for her, which is when she got to the end of her student loan debt and would have those loans forgiven, that she wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it because she would be insolvent in the IRS’ definition where your debts far exceed your assets and your ability to pay them.

And again, while she was an extreme example, I was talking to lots and lots of young adults who were coming in and interested in making plans but had so little free cash flow after their student loan payments that they were struggling to start a retirement account or even have emergency savings, to say nothing of buying homes or doing all the things that we think of as the standard building blocks of adulthood. And at the same time, there was another group of people that I felt like I was hearing from a lot, and those were parents who were struggling to figure out how they were going to pay for their children’s educations and putting it as a very high priority overall in their goals but not really having an understanding of how they were going to come up with the dollars to do it.

So, I realized that if I could help that group of parents that maybe I could reduce the number of those other young adults that I was talking to. But I would say the attorney really made it very tangible. I knew there were people out there who owed all these student loans. But sitting across the table from this woman and seeing the sense of hopelessness that she felt as a result of getting a great education was very life changing to me, because to me, education has always been a building block of opportunity, of adulthood, and to see that it was completely the opposite for her made a huge impression on me.

Ptak: In the book, you wrote that when it comes to college, no outside entity will protect you from making a terrible financial decision, and then you go on to note that you couldn’t get a mortgage for a house you could never afford, but nothing stops people from borrowing more for college than you can pay back. Why are there fewer guardrails around college outlays, do you think?

Garcia: It’s a great question. On the one hand, the federal student loan programs for students do have some pretty strict guardrails, but nothing prevents students from going and getting additional loans on the private market or parents from taking out parent PLUS Loans. And we as people tend to think that what our children want and need, and particularly the best possible version of that, is worthy of every penny that we have. And, unfortunately, no one will stop you from taking out these loans.

The way that the direct student loan, which is the loan that undergraduate students can take, is structured is, it’s the one loan that an 18-year-old can take without a co-signer, without any kind of credit history and still get a very favorable interest rate. And so, that opens up all these other issues that don’t exist in normal loans. There is no qualification for that loan other than filing the FAFSA. I firmly believe that if there were less loans available to parents, the cost of college would be much lower than it is, because I think that making all those additional dollars available and having an audience that’s willing to spend that kind of money has a huge impact on driving up the cost of college.

Benz: We want to spend some time on deciding whether loans are appropriate and also the FAFSA that you referenced, the application for financial aid. But before we get into the weeds a little bit in college funding, I want to hear about your own experience with this. You wove that in a little bit into your book. You went through the application and college-funding process not too long ago with your twins. So, I’m curious, what were some of the biggest surprises for you, a college-funding expert, as you went through that process with your two children?

Garcia: A great question. There were definitely plenty of them. As much as we can learn—we always learn there’s plenty more out there that we don’t know. So, I have twins who are currently college seniors, and they’re very, very different students. So, their two college application processes were very different. I think to me, one of the biggest surprises, given that I’m a really analytical person and I took a really analytical approach to college and encouraged my kids to see it the same way, I was surprised at how different the responses that they got from different colleges were.

So, for example, my son applied to two colleges. He applied early action to both, which is where you submit your application early, you get an answer early, but you have until the regular decision deadline to make a decision. One of the colleges replied instantly to him with an acceptance and a big scholarship offer and sent him stickers—put one on your laptop, put one on your phone. He was getting emails multiple times a week. Something would come in the mail periodically. And it was just crickets from the other school. And I thought we were going to receive two acceptances and two award letters on roughly the same schedule and be able to sit down and deliberate our way through them. But instead, he was getting this marketing onslaught from one of the colleges and hearing nothing from the other. And for a 17-year-old it was like, oh, somebody likes me and somebody else doesn’t. And it was a very challenging, emotional side of the college application process to deal with.

I think one of the really important lessons for me in going through this with my own kids is that planning for college is equal parts financial planning and parenting. Making sure that your kids understand the process, understand the budget, understand the priorities and what they’re trying to do and that you’re putting some guardrails around their decisions and around their exploration so that you can help them and coach them to good decisions in that process.

I think another big surprise for us was the number of colleges that use unweighted GPA to award merit scholarship. As you go through high school, the schools really encourage students to take higher-level courses, AP/IB, dual credit, whatever it is that the high school offers. That tends to be presented as the best choice in every circumstance. We learned from my son’s experience, where he took a lot of those classes and really struggled in them, they weren’t a good fit for him as a student. So, we were disappointed to see that the college that he chose awarded scholarships on the basis of unweighted GPA. And if we had not pushed him into all these higher-level courses, he would have been eligible for about $12,000 a year more in merit scholarships. I’m not going to say you shouldn’t challenge yourself academically or you shouldn’t take the hardest courses that are available to you. He certainly felt well-prepared as a student when he got to college. But having an extra $48,000 left over because of bigger scholarships would have been a real difference-maker for our family.

Ptak: I think you mentioned your twins are, in addition to being different people, they’re different types of students. How did you approach the college process differently with each of them?

Garcia: I was fortunate that they both wanted different things from the college process. My daughter, we felt, was a really good fit for a private college, a smaller environment, and she was very committed to not going to college around home. And so, we went out and did the whole college tour where we went and visited a whole bunch of colleges. We talked a lot about budgets and funding, because obviously, those were for the most part quite a bit more expensive than our in-state schools. But very much encouraged her to explore those options. One of the things that you find is that just the costs are so different across the board in colleges, and if you’re willing to use cost as one of the lenses that you’re looking at for college, you can find a lot of different opportunities. So, with her, we really explored a range of opportunities and saw that college was available to her at a range of different prices. And we were fortunate that her top choice school accepted her with a great financial aid package, but that involved writing a lot of essays, doing a lot of applications, applying for a lot of different scholarships so that she could close the gap between our budget and some of the colleges that she was interested in.

Our son, on the other hand, was I would say, a very typical boy. He thought school was OK. But he liked sports. He liked having a job. He liked having a girlfriend. So, high school was one of several priorities. And for him we sort of jokingly said, we’ll put as much effort into paying for college as you put into being successful in high school. So, his budget for college was what it would cost him to stay in state. We said, you can probably find some other alternatives besides this, but this is really what the budget is. And he was fortunate to find another option that had a scholarship just for someone like him.

But with my daughter, we used an essay coach to help her with her applications because there were just too many essays that she had to write. We joked it was our winter break vacation insurance just to have somebody else make sure that all got done. We had her do some test prep classes because she was applying to highly selective colleges. She took a full suite of IB classes in high school. With our son, it was the complete opposite. There was an after-school ACT prep class that was free at our high school that he signed up for. He applied to two colleges. He got into both and was perfectly happy with where that ended up.

I will say too now that they’re seniors and they’ve both gone very, very different paths in college, they have each accepted a job for when they graduate, which are virtually identical jobs but for the particular fields of study that they’re in. So, two important points there. One is, everyone can find a path that works for them. And two is, going to a highly selective school versus a highly not selective school does not have a huge impact on what the actual outcomes that the student should expect are.

Benz: I wanted to ask about that, Ann, because the data are fairly clear that going to college delivers a payoff in terms of lifetime earnings and so forth as well as something you talked about in the book: health and maybe even happiness. But where you go, what do the data say about that in terms of outcomes, life outcomes, earnings? The highly selective schools versus less-selective schools, what do we know when we look at the data on that?

Garcia: The data is pretty clear on that where you go to school really is not what’s going to determine who you are as an adult. You can look at big surveys. You can also look at things like where the Fortune 500 CEOs went to college. And the college that produced the most Fortune 500 CEOs is not Harvard, it’s not Stanford; it’s Texas A&M. Every year Rhodes scholarships are announced right before Thanksgiving, and the students who are selected represent an incredible diversity of undergraduate institutions and clearly not just the Ivy Leagues.

There was a great research project that was done a few years ago called the Purdue-Gallup report. In this survey, they surveyed adults who self-rated as successful. So, it’s not we’re only talking to people whose incomes are above X, but we’re talking to people who are themselves successful and satisfied with their lives. And it was all about figuring out how college had informed that success. What they found was there was no correlation whatsoever between what college they went to, what type of college they went to, or any of those “which college” questions about it. Really their success came down to specific experiences that they had in college. So, they were things like feeling like their professors cared about them, being able to apply what they learned in the classroom to the world at large, participating in extracurriculars, finding mentors who could help them explore life paths and whatnot. And I would say, my experience as a parent has been that both of my kids found environments where they engaged and really made the most of their four-year college experience, which is what has led them both to great career paths coming out of two really different colleges.

I encourage parents to think about why college as opposed to which college. So, there are lots and lots of good reasons for students to go to college—higher lifetime earnings. Your typical college graduate will make about $1 million total over their lifetime more than those without a college degree. Unemployment rates are much lower. But there are tons of noneconomic benefits to going to college as well. There’s lower heart disease and type 2 diabetes among college graduates than nongraduates. College graduates marry at higher rates and divorce at lower rates than noncollege graduates. So, there are all sorts of halo effects of getting a college education, none of which is dependent on which specific college you went to.

Ptak: But it will cost you, and that’s something that you talk about in your book, in which you note that the cost of attendance at public universities and private colleges increased by nearly 500% between 1986 and 2016. What are the key factors that has led the college inflation rate to be so much higher than the general inflation rate for the past several decades?

Garcia: It’s hard to point to one specific thing. It’s really a cluster of factors. You could talk about declining state funding, you could talk about increasing administrative costs and not just highly paid college presidents, but also the whole suite of support services that have been deployed across colleges to make sure that kids graduate in four years and move on to productive places in the world—nicer dorms, nicer facilities, upgraded labs, all kinds of things. I personally think that a big reason why the cost of college has gone up so much is that so many people are willing to pay the full price of college. As much as I talk to people about finding scholarships, finding ways to reduce their cost of college, budgeting for college and being realistic about what college costs, the number of people who go into the college application process expecting to pay full price for their child to attend a private school is absolutely mind boggling. And I firmly believe that if we all just decided we weren’t going to pay $80,000 a year for college, college wouldn’t cost $80,000 a year.

Benz: Well, I’m curious, Ann, who’s paying the full freight?

Garcia: Lots of families. Looking at the most selective colleges, anywhere between a quarter and a third of families are not even filing the FAFSA at all. So, they’re going into that expecting that they will pay full price. In my practice, I regularly talk to parents who say, “I know this college costs $75,000 a year, but it’s just perfect for my child and I really want to make that happen.” And it’s shocking to me. There is a large body of people out there who do believe that paying full price for college is perfectly OK.

Fortunately, it’s not the majority of people, and as a result, to fill the rest of those seats at the college, colleges are forced to discount tuition pretty substantially. One of the things that I pay attention to is what’s called the tuition discount rate, and that’s the average rate at which colleges discount their tuition. That rate is actually higher than 50% right now, which means that for every $1,000 of tuition that’s charged, less than $500 is paid. That does not mean that you will pay half of what list price is, but that does mean that if you are willing to look for colleges that offer scholarships for students like your child, you will find them. And in fact, the average net price of college has been pretty flat since the Great Recession, which means that, although published list prices are going up by about 6% a year, the actual amount that people are paying has stayed pretty flat.

Ptak: What role do you think a student’s anticipated career path, to the extent they have one, should play in determining how much to spend on college and whether to take loans to cover it?

Garcia: That’s such a good question because I know there’s that adage of don’t borrow more than your anticipated first-year salary. I would say to that 50% of students go into college undeclared and about 75% change their major over the course of their college career. So, it’s a little bit risky to say, “I’m going in as an engineer and engineers make $75,000 a year average starting salary. So, I’m fine to borrow that much and therefore, I’m going to choose XYZ college as a result.” You may end up being an engineer, but you also might not. And so, making a financial commitment on that basis is, I think, really unwise.

Again, this is me speaking as a parent. I feel like kids are under a lot of pressure when they’re in high school to know what they want to be and to know what their major is going to be and to treat college as a four-year pathway to a career versus an opportunity to really explore broadly. So, to the extent that we are coaching our kids that that’s what they should be thinking as a 16, 17-year-old when they have very little experience or visibility to the world of careers and in particular, a lot of those higher-paying initially fields like engineering, where they, again, don’t have a whole lot of direct experience with what that job looks like, what those courses look like, I think that’s really quite risky.

My recommendation to parents is always that they stick within the limits of the federal direct student loan program for their borrowing. Students who take out that loan every year will graduate from college owing somewhere upward of $27,000, depending on interest rates and how much interest has accrued, and that translates to a monthly payment of around $325 a month for 10 years. That’s an amount that a college degree will almost always cover. In fact, very few students who earn a bachelor’s degree and take out federal direct student loans, very few of them are among those groups of people who really struggle with student loans.

Benz: You talk about that in the book, Ann, who is struggling with student loans. Can you characterize those individuals? What sorts of decisions they’ve made? What sorts of career paths they’ve chosen, and so forth?

Garcia: Absolutely. I feel like, if you listen to the news, you think taking out a student loan is a one-way ticket to the poor house. And for a lot of students, student loans are the difference between going to college and not going to college. So, there’s definitely a universe where that’s an OK decision, and to me, that’s those students who take out that direct student loan and graduate with a reasonable amount.

The people who are really struggling with student loans fall into three categories. One is people who go to graduate school. With graduate school, you can borrow up to the full cost of attendance. Many students go into graduate school still owing on their undergraduate loans, and they end up like my attorney/client from years ago where the interest keeps accruing on those loans while they’re in college, and they graduate owing well into the six figures. We tend to think of doctors and attorneys when we think of those people with tons and tons of student loan debt and say, well, they’re going to have careers that will allow them to pay it off. But there are an increasing number of career paths that require advanced degrees. Social work, physical therapy in many states requires a doctorate, veterinarians. All kinds of career paths that don’t have anywhere near the salary expectations of doctors and lawyers and there are loads and loads of people who are in well over their head on student loan debt from graduate school.

Another group is people who go to college, take out loans, and then don’t graduate. So, those are people who have that student loan debt but don’t have the earnings power that goes hand in hand with having earned the degree. The third group is people who attend for-profit colleges, and those are the colleges that you hear about in the news for their predatory lending practices, they might be schools for massage therapy, or cooking schools, or places where you go to get a technical degree, where in many cases, the degree that a student earns from those colleges is not worth the paper that it’s printed on. Nonetheless, they’re allowed to take out student loans to go there, and they come out fortunate to be able to find minimum-wage-level work, but with oftentimes graduate-school-level student loan debt.

Ptak: What’s your take on whether parents should take on debt to help pay for their kids’ college? Do you think that’s ever a good idea?

Garcia: There are very limited circumstances, I would say, where that makes sense. I generally try to discourage it because most parents are in their 50s when their student comes out of college. And if you come out of college in your 50s with student loan debt and maybe still having a mortgage and trying to make your retirement catch-up contributions, something is going to fall by the wayside. I just feel like the timeline for parents to pay off student loans is really not favorable.

There are a few instances where that could make sense. For example, a parent who’s much older. I had a client whose dad was 71 when the daughter went off to college. The family didn’t have a lot of money. But because of quirks in the FAFSA formula, they weren’t eligible for the financial aid that they should have been eligible for. And in their case, what they ended up doing was having dad take out Parent Plus loans for college, get into an income-based repayment program, defer the loans as long as possible. And he’ll make a payment of about $60 a month for the rest of his life and then those loans will retire with him.

Another group of parents who might consider taking out loans are parents who are eligible for public service loan forgiveness. So, for example, a parent who’s a teacher or who works for a nonprofit, Parent Plus loans can actually be consolidated into direct consolidation loans, and then the parent can get into the income-driven repayment program and then make payments for 10 years and have the loan balance forgiven. It can be a bit of a risky strategy because the parent needs to be sure that they have at least a 10-year career path following their child’s graduation, so after they are able to consolidate those loans and go into repayment and get that forgiveness. Because otherwise, they’ll make income-driven payments and then be stuck without the forgiveness and with the larger balance that goes along with that.

Sometimes for parents who are quite young, it can make sense just because they haven’t had the earnings power maybe over the course of their child’s lifetime to save in high amounts. Sometimes families will talk about strategies that they might use, like a lower-income family, where the grandparents have a bunch of money and would be willing to help the student with college but taking that help might impact their financial aid. Sometimes those families will have the parents take out loans and the grandparents repay them once they’re graduated. But by and large, the direct student loan for students is really the best place to go for borrowing. And I tell parents too that even if the parent intends to be the one paying for college and being the one paying for the loan, it should still be the student who takes out the loan. There’s a couple reasons for that. One is that the direct student loan has the lowest fees and the lowest interest rates of all the federal loans. Another is that the student is more likely to be at an income level where their student loan interest could be deductible, and that could be roughly equivalent to one month’s payment every year, and it can help the student to build credit as well.

Benz: I want to stick with parental finances for a second longer. A perennial issue in households where parents have children is how to balance their own retirement savings alongside saving for college. I know there’s always that visceral pull on the part of so many parents to send their kids wherever their hearts desire. But what are practical strategies for parents balancing those two expensive financial goals?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a delicate balancing act too, because as you’ve seen, for a lot of parents, college is such a tangible thing and retirement is this very nebulous far off, I don’t know what that looks like, I don’t know what I want to do.

Benz: Right.

Garcia: But I do know that I want my kid to go to college in 2031. So, a couple of things. One is, I think, that we as advisors need to step away from the two most common pieces of advice that we give—one is, don’t save for college; save for retirement. You can take out loans for college, not for retirement. That’s how we ended up with a trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt. But the other thing that advisors tend to tell families is, “You want your child to go to private school, well, private school costs $80,000 a year. Inflation rate of this, times four years. That means you need to save $2,000 month every month if you want your child to be able to go to private college.” That doesn’t work for families either. So, there needs to be some sort of middle ground.

My recommendation is this: If you don’t have emergency savings, you don’t have college savings. Emergency savings should always be a family’s first priority. Families who are saving for retirement but not maxing out retirement shouldn’t contribute more than 10% of what they’re putting toward retirement into college. So, if you’re saving $10,000 a year for retirement, you should not save more than $1,000 a year for college. If you want to save more for college, then save more for retirement in addition and move those two up together. Once parents are maxing out on retirement savings, then they have more flexibility to add to their college savings. The things that families can do if they’re really not able to contribute as much as they’d like to to savings—most 529 plans have a gifting page that you can share with family and encourage them to be making contributions to that account. I also encourage families to every year on their child’s birthday look at their budget, think about who their child is becoming and who they want them to become in the future and use that as an opportunity to bump up their savings rate, even if it’s by $5 a month. The more savings you have, the more choices your child will have. There are loads and loads of pathways through college at whatever amount of savings a family has. So, certainly, if you’re not saving $2,000 a month, you have not eliminated the option of going to private school. And I say that as a parent who never contributed more than a couple of hundred dollars a month to my kids’ 529s and whose daughter is going to graduate from the world’s most expensive private college debt-free in June.

Ptak: Speaking of 529s, I think you think the 529 college savings plan is the best option for saving for college. But there’s a lot of confusion about the interplay, how savings affects financial aid eligibility. What do people need to know about that?

Garcia: And that is, I think, such a big fear for parents that if I save, I’m going to lose out on financial aid. Savings have a very negligible impact on financial aid eligibility. So, there are four components to the FAFSA’s formula for calculating expected family contribution or student aid index. It counts the parents’ income, the parents’ assets, the student’s income, and the student’s assets. The parents’ income is by far the biggest piece of that, simply because of how the formula counts the parents’ income. Any nonretirement savings that the family has, and that includes money in your checking or savings account, it includes taxable brokerage accounts, it includes 529 accounts for all the family’s children. Those are assessed at 5.64% of their value, which means that every $1,000 you have in savings costs you $56 in the financial aid formula. That puts you ahead by $944. So, yes, it will cost you a small amount in financial aid, but it will open up a world of additional choices to your child to have some savings.

Benz: I’m curious, Ann, are there any ways to think about your own household financial picture as you’re embarking on this FAFSA, which you think is really important for everyone to fill out? Any hacks that you can share to make yourself look better on FAFSA?

Garcia: So, I would say, filing the FAFSA is a lot like filing your taxes. If you wait till April 15 and just fill out the form, you’ll probably end up owing a little bit more than you would have if you had thought about it may be back in October and made some plans. The FAFSA works the same way. So, as I was saying, the biggest piece of the formula is the parents’ income. The biggest place where people put attention is the parents’ assets and that’s mostly because the assets are the only thing you can do anything about when the time comes to file it. The FAFSA uses what’s called prior year income, which means when you file the FAFSA in the fall, you’re using your most recently completed tax return, and it’s for the education year of the next year. So, it’s 2023. If I’m filing the FAFSA in the fall of 2023 to start college in the fall of 2024, I’m using my 2022 income tax return. So, that is the year that starts Jan. 1 of sophomore year and goes through Dec. 31 of junior year.

There are really limited things you can do to hack the FAFSA, game the FAFSA because of how the formula is structured. I think if you went to your manager and said please don’t pay me my December paycheck in January, please can I have that in December? Can I have that in January instead? They would say no, sorry, that’s not that’s not going to work. The biggest subtraction from your income that you have is how much you pay in taxes. So, families who are eligible for need-based aid might choose to pay more taxes in a year that counts for the FAFSA and that could mean switching your retirement contributions from pretax to Roth. That could mean pushing tax deductions into other years if you itemize. That’s really the biggest way to influence the FAFSA.

If you’re someone who has an inherited IRA where you’re taking lifetime distributions, you might increase those distributions in the years before your FAFSA income years in order to reduce the amount of distribution that you have to take in those FAFSA years. People tend to think that, oh, if I put more money into retirement, that will help me. The FAFSA doesn’t use adjusted gross income. It uses total income. So, it has you add back all of your pretax income sources. A lot of families are given the guidance that they should use a Roth IRA instead of a 529 to pay for college because they don’t report that Roth IRA as an asset on the FAFSA. The problem is that when you take the money out, you do report it as income. And every incremental dollar of income is assessed at $0.47 of its value, whereas every incremental dollar of assets is assessed at 5.6% of its value. So, not really a ton of hacks for families who have W-2 income other than putting more tax dollars into their FAFSA income years.

One thing that families tend to overlook is that student’s assets are also part of the formula. And with wages having risen as much as they have in the last few years, students often earn a lot of money over the summer—if they’re making $15 an hour working 30 hours a week for 10 weeks, that’s a pretty good amount of money that might be in their bank account still when the time comes for them to file the FAFSA. I always encourage families if the student has money that is money that’s intended for college, they can put it in the parents’ 529 and then it’s treated as a parent asset where it’s less heavily weighed in the formula.

A better strategy than trying to game the FAFSA is to first figure out if it’s even worth it. And the Department of Education has a tool on their website called the Student Aid Estimator. With a Student Aid Estimator, you can enter your family’s financial data and they’ll give you an estimate of what your expected family contribution or student aid index, which is what it will be called starting this year, what that is. If that number is higher than the cost of college, then you are not eligible for need-based financial aid and you don’t need to get into a whole bunch of games around how to file; what you’re going to do to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. Most families aren’t in that threshold. So, it certainly makes sense to do what you can to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. The other thing is, assets are a piece of it. Again, because they count for so little, you have to do some pretty big things to make them make a difference. A lot of people seem to think you have to file the FAFSA on Oct. 1. I usually encourage people to pay all their big bills before they file the FAFSA—any money that’s going to get out of your account anyway, you might as well do it before you file. So, if you can pay your property taxes before you file, if you can make an early mortgage payment. Definitely wait till after you’ve paid your mortgage and your credit card. But a lot of that really is nibbling around the edges.

Ptak: I know you said there aren’t a lot of hacks, but that was very, very educational. Thanks for that. I did want to ask you about scholarships. You note that merit scholarships are the primary means of tuition discounting. Are those based exclusively on the student’s test scores, academic performance, and other personal qualities, or do FAFSA and the family’s financial wherewithal come into play in that area too?

Garcia: It depends. There’s such a range of scholarships. To give you an example of the range of scholarships, my son has a scholarship for playing video games. Yeah, for video games, not for academics or anything else. There are some merit scholarships that have a need-based component to them. So, even families who don’t think that they’re going to be eligible for financial aid should be filing the FAFSA, because sometimes that’s a requirement to be considered for a scholarship that is a merit scholarship. By and large, the merit scholarships are based on grades, to some degree on test scores, that depends a lot on the college right now, or because the student has some other attribute that the college is interested in, such as being a good video game player.

Or alternatively, for example, a lot of the smaller private schools take a lot of pride in having students from every state. You might be the only student from your state who’s applying there, and they’re going to really want to make sure that you actually enroll and attend so they can keep saying that. Obviously, that works better for those of us from smaller states like Oregon than those of you from larger states like Illinois. But if you draw a 200-mile radius around your house and start looking for colleges that are outside that 200-mile radius, you might find that you are getting more scholarship offers than you think you are. But the majority of merit scholarships are done on the basis of grades, and the reason for that is that colleges want to attract higher-performing students because that makes them look better in the U.S. News & World Report Rankings. So, families who want to find where their student might be eligible for scholarships, there are great websites like CollegeData and College Navigator that will show you median 50 percentile GPAs and test scores for the current freshman class so that you can see if you’re above that range, you’re probably going to be eligible for a merit scholarship if that college offers merit scholarships.

Benz: You referenced those U.S. News & World Report Rankings. Can you discuss the interplay between these merit scholarships and schools’ rankings there?

Garcia: So, in case anybody still tracking, Rick Singer just got sentenced to prison. That was the guy who helped people fake their kids’ resumes and transcripts and test scores. So, the thing with the U.S. News & World Report Rankings is, colleges want to do better at them, and they want to move up in the rankings, and they use merit scholarships to attract students who will help them move up in the rankings. One of the rankings criteria is the caliber of the student body in that space, primarily now on grades, secondarily on test scores. There’s been an adjustment in the test score component of it where it used to be that colleges were downgraded if more than 10% of their students did not submit test scores. They’ve changed that. So, now, it’s if more than 50% of your students don’t submit test scores, they do get downgraded in the rankings. But U.S. News Rankings are a huge issue for colleges because so many families use them to say, oh, College X is better than College Y. And so, merit scholarships are the primary tool that colleges use to attract the students who will help them to move up in the rankings. And that’s why if your student has a GPA that’s in the upper quartile or the top quintile of the student bodies, they are probably someone that college would like to enroll.

Benz: I wanted to follow up on that, Ann, because this has come up with several of my friends’ kids where they have this conundrum about whether to reach for the higher-cost prestigious school versus going to the somewhat less-prestigious school that is much less costly because it’s awarding a lot more merit-based aid. So, how should students and their families approach that issue?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a tough area for parents to navigate. I would say that as a society we have a tendency to equate cost and exclusivity with quality. And yet, you look at college and it’s a very subjective experience. When I look at my own two kids who are twins, each of them is thriving in the environment that they’re in, and each of them is thriving in an environment that’s very different from where their twin is. And I don’t think that either one of them would be successful if they were to change places.

I think it’s really important for parents to focus on what environments—academically and socially and financially—what types of environments is there student likely to succeed in? One of the things that my daughter loved about her college when we went to visit it, is they said, every dorm is divided into houses, so you have a small group of around 100 students who are in your house, and every house has its own table in the dining commons where they sit to each. And she said, oh my gosh, not having lunch table drama would be so amazing. My son wanted the big college, football Saturdays’ experience. He craved the anonymity of a big school after toiling in the shadows of his far more academically successful sister for the previous 18 years. I think success is so subjective. Going back to that Purdue-Gallup study, where is your student going to engage, where are they going to find mentors, where are they going to find projects that fit for them? Those are the things that lead to success, not the name on your diploma. College makes you a more educated version of yourself. It’s not what creates yourself.

Ptak: We asked you about hacks before. We’re going to try again. Maybe you can share some hacks that high school students and their families should consider to improve their eligibility for merit scholarships.

Garcia: I think, the best thing for students to do is to look close to home. Have that be your starting point. Every college and career center has a big list of scholarships that are available to you. So, this is looking at the outside scholarships for merit scholarships. So, look at those, talk to teachers, talk to coaches, ask them what scholarships you should be looking at. On the institutional side, a really great starting point is looking at your in-state colleges and seeing what their merit awards are and what criteria they’re granted on. So, we always think of merit scholarships as being part of the private school landscape. They’re also a big part of the public school landscape. Look at what scholarships are offered and who gets them. Typically, at public schools, there are a range of scholarships that you will automatically get as long as your GPA is above a certain threshold. So, look at that. Look at that early in your high school career so that you are tracking toward that GPA, so that you are choosing your courses on that basis. It was a big learning to us that a lot of schools use unweighted GPA in awarding scholarships. And had we looked into that a little earlier, we would have gotten a lot more scholarship dollars.

The other thing to look at is many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, the good news is, simply submitting your college application and your FAFSA and CSS Profile if you’re applying to a school that needs them is going to put you in the running for a lot of the scholarships that the college offers. Many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, for example, when my daughter was looking at colleges, she had a budget. We did the net price calculators for all the schools that she looked at to see what our likely cost would be. And one of the colleges she was interested in was above our cost. She went back to their website and found out there was another scholarship she could apply for that would bring her cost down to where it would fit in our budget. So, that one made our list.

Speaking of which, the best hack for families getting started is the net price calculator at the college. So, every college is required to have one of these. It’s a tool where you input your financial, and sometimes your academic, information, and it will tell you what students like you received financial aid on average in the current academic year. They’re not foolproof, and they’re not a guarantee of what you’re going to get. I will say that, in our case, every actual award that my daughter got was within $2,000 of what the net price calculator had told us it would be. So, those are a great indication of what a college is likely to cost you.

Above and beyond that, lots and lots of departments within the college have their own sets of scholarships that they offer. We have a friend whose son is studying meteorology and that being a small major, lots and lots of colleges had dollars available for meteorology students, and I was like, well, that’s nice for Myles, but what about for Alex and Gabby, my kids, who did not have such specific interests? And we found the business school has scholarships for students. A lot of private colleges offer scholarships to students who live within a small radius of where they attend, or students whose parents are police officers or firefighters. So, do your homework on the schools to find out what they offer, because oftentimes the most expensive schools on paper are not the most expensive schools in reality. My daughter goes to, as I said, the most expensive school on Earth, but it was her second-cheapest choice once she got her aid package, and that’s not at all atypical. So, do the net price calculators, look at the scholarship page on the school, and then look for outside scholarships. And for those, look close to home. Ask teachers, ask your employer about any scholarships that they have. My daughter’s computer science teacher in high school had recommended that she apply for a scholarship, which she ended up getting and it’s been $5,000 a year, plus she got a computer one year and then every year since then she’s gotten $1,000 to spend on technology. She also got a professional mentor who helped her land an internship that has led to a full-time job offer when she graduates, and that all came from a high school teacher.

Benz: Sounds like a good scholarship. I wanted to ask about applying because you go into some detail about figuring out where to apply. It’s stunning how many schools kids seem to be applying to. But how many schools should students apply to? And also, what sort of diversity should students and their families look for in terms of the types of college that they apply to? You have some guidance in the book on that.

Garcia: It’s so easy with the Common App to just add more colleges to your list. Because in many cases, it’s just checking a box and sending your application. It costs about $100 for every school that you apply to, particularly if they are private schools, because you’re sending the CSS Profile and probably some test scores in addition to paying an application fee. So, first and foremost, you should give your student an application budget and make sure that all the colleges fit within that budget. In my book, I have a worksheet for students to track the colleges that they’re interested in and thinking of applying to.

One of the things with private colleges is they typically require three essays each. One of them is the Common App standard essay. But then, they will typically have two additional essays that you will have to write a specific essay for that school. So, as you add colleges to your list, not only are you adding cost and check boxes on the Common App, but you’re also adding work for your student, work in writing essays, work in figuring out what letters of rec you need because some colleges also require the letters of rec to be from specific types of teachers versus the general population. There may be scholarships that the student is applying for that have additional applications. And much as you want your child to have this unlimited universe of choices, you also want them to be present for their senior year of high school. And if all they’re doing is writing college application essays, they will not be present in other aspects of their life.

So, my recommendation for families is always, number one, find a financial safety school that belongs on your list. That’s probably some flavor of in-state public school. It may be alternate pathways like free community college. So, once you’ve identified at least one safety school, you want to make sure that you have a good body of schools that your student is going to be accepted to. And then, include some reach schools if you want. With my family, we used a couple of tools to narrow down our list. One was the net price calculators. So, every college that my daughter was interested in, we did the net price calculator. If it came out to above a certain number, that college was automatically off of our list unless she could find a pathway through other scholarships that weren’t included there that would get you there. And then, we did the exercise of why would you go there. And so, we went through every college she was looking at and said, why would you go there? So, if you got accepted to all of these colleges, to every college you applied to, which one would you choose? And she had two colleges that she said she’d have a hard time choosing between. And then, we went through this exercise of, OK, if you didn’t get into those two, what would be the next one that you’d want to go to? Which one from this group that we’re pretty sure that you’re going to get into would you choose? So, we went through that exercise and got her down to a list of about eight schools that she applied to. Even applying to eight colleges, she still had to write 24 essays, and not all of them were specific for the schools; some were for scholarships, some were for other things. So, you definitely want to manage your student’s workload. If you can’t figure out a reason why you would actually attend that college, then just don’t apply. But do make sure that you have financial safety schools as well as admission safety schools on your list.

I would think students shouldn’t apply to more than 10 schools. I think I said my son applied to two and he was fine with that and had all the choices that he wanted. So, you also shouldn’t feel like you have to apply to a lot of schools. In terms of diversity of schools, I would say the criteria for diversity to me—you should apply to some big schools and some small schools. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a big school. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a small school. You don’t need to arbitrarily apply to a lot of different types of schools. But you should apply to several schools that you’re very confident that you’ll get into where you’re in that top quartile academically, schools that accept more than 10% of applicants, you should apply to some schools that you absolutely know that you can afford, and you apply to some schools that you love if there’s a path to making them work for your family financially.

Ptak: Last question we wanted to ask you is, reflecting on all that you’ve learned personally and in your research about the college funding and application process, what are the key things you’d like to see changed to make it work better for students and their families?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s hard to narrow it down to a few things. One of the challenges about the college process is just how opaque it is, and so transparency would be a big thing. But I think the bigger issue beyond transparency is the complexity of all the pieces. The FAFSA is really complex and even despite simplification it will still be complex. And it’s especially complex for first-generation students and low-income students, the people who need the resources that the FAFSA provides the most. So, I would like to see that truly simplified. To me, truly simplifying the FAFSA is things like if you’re eligible for free and reduced lunch in high school, you should be eligible for a Pell Grant without filing the FAFSA and your expected family contribution should be a certain number that’s somewhere within the range of Pell eligibility.

I’d also like to see as parents focus more on what’s best for our children instead of what’s best in the eyes of U.S. News & World Report. College is like youth sports on steroids. When you hear parents talking about where their child is applying, where they’ve been accepted, where they’re going—I have a kid who’s going to a very unselective school, and he’s had a great experience and he has a great job coming out of it. Not only that, but he’s succeeded in ways that have surprised me and I’m just thrilled with the person that he’s become at this college. I have another child who’s done really well at a different school. But if we as parents focus more on what makes our children successful academically and socially and what works for us financially and use that as a guide to our college choices, I think that will decomplexify the system a whole lot.

I think one of the areas where we really fall short is our lack of public policy support for education, and by that I mean not just dollars for education, but actual support for education. As a society, we need more nurses and engineers and yet getting into nursing school is like getting into Harvard. Our educational system should be supporting our societal needs much better than it has and not just by making loans and small grants available for students. So, it shouldn’t be as difficult as it is to get into a degree path for a field that we have massive shortages around. But that’s a function of having a higher level of public policy support than we have and having colleges focused on serving the larger community, the larger society, as opposed to primarily the students who are enrolled at their institution.

Transcript

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar, Inc.

Ptak: Our guest on the podcast today is personal-finance columnist and author Michelle Singletary. Michelle writes the nationally syndicated column ""The Color of Money,"" which appears in The Washington Post, as well as in dozens of other newspapers nationwide. She's also the author of three personal finance books. The most recent was called The 21-Day Financial Fast: Your Path to Financial Peace and Freedom. Michelle is a frequent guest on TV and radio, and she was host of her own national television program, Singletary Says on TV One. She is a graduate of the University of Maryland at College Park. She has received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Johns Hopkins University, where she earned a master's degree in business and management.

Michelle, welcome to The Long View.

Michelle Singletary: Oh, you're so welcome.

Ptak: To start off, you spend a lot of time answering questions from consumers. Have the various attempts to provide economic relief to people who have been affected by the virus been sufficient in your view?

Singletary: I think for the vast majority of people who received the stimulus payment, it has helped them. I've heard from many people from across economic stratas. So, people who are working low-wage jobs, even professionals who have lost their jobs or their hours have been reduced. And they all said those who have received their payments said it did help with rent or mortgage or paying some bills or food. And so, it was a breath of financial air for them.

Benz: You've been writing a lot about the various glitches that people have been experiencing with respect to these stimulus checks. Can you summarize the state of the state with this today and what some of the main issues and logjams have been?

Singletary: Yes, to the IRS' credit and Treasury's credit, they did have to get a lot of money out to a lot of individuals over a very short period of time. I think the last number I saw was 159 million payments worth $200-plus billion. So, that's a lot of payments in just four or five weeks. But there were a lot of glitches along the way. They created two online tools to help people receive their payments. So, according to the CARES Act, if you filed a 2018 or 2019 federal return, and had a refund, that you were sort of clear sailing--you'd get your money in the same account that you got your refund. If you didn't file because you maybe didn't earn enough income or you were on Social Security or maybe for whatever reason, then you had to use these two different tools.

One is Get My Payment. So say you had to pay taxes for 2018 to 2019. The IRS was not going to be using that bank account. I know it sounds crazy, because everybody has written me like that makes no sense. They have the bank account information. But the IRS interpreted the law is that they had to get your permission to put money in an account, which you gave when you gave them refund information for a direct deposit. So, if you had a tax return, in which you owed, then you had to go to this tool, Get My Payment, which was a disaster when it first launched. I mean, it was glitchy, people couldn't get information in, and then you had to be exact in how you put information in. Like, if you capitalize your street and they have it in their system as a lowercase, it might not have gone through.

And then, the second tool was for non-filers, those are folks who did not file for 2018 and 2019 and didn't have to because they didn't make a lot of money. And so that is now the challenge is to get money to those folks because the IRS doesn't know that they're out there. And so they have to use this tool. Well, a lot of people who probably use it may not have Internet access right now. And then there was another group of federal beneficiaries, those who receive Social Security, or Social Security Disability as supplemental SSI, or veterans' benefits or railroad retirement benefits. Now, that was a disaster. Because IRS and Social Security--their systems don't talk to each other. So, the IRS had to go get information from the Social Security Administration, and it was just--it's still a mess. I'm still hearing from retirees who haven't gotten their stimulus payment for just a number of reasons. Maybe they filed a 2018 return or 2019 return and had to pay. So, the IRS is looking at that information as opposed to Social Security information. So, it's just a hot mess for a lot of people still.

Ptak: One thing that we've seen in this crisis and in previous ones is that people have a hard time amassing an emergency fund to help them through job loss or other financial shocks. Do you think our system should make it easier for people to amass an emergency fund in addition to the incentives we give people to save for retirement?

Singletary: It is definitely an issue. And let me tell you this, we often talk about the lack of savings. And right away people think, Oh, it's lower-middle-income folks who don't have it. But let me tell you that a lot of the people that I work with through my community involvement, make six-figure salaries. They have a 401(k) or a 403(b) and they're saving for retirement and they have no cash cushion. They are living paycheck to paycheck. And so, this pandemic hit them hard too--maybe they have reduced hours, or they are trying to help other relatives and they have nothing to pull from. And so, it's so crucial to have that emergency fund at all income levels. And it's sometimes harder to persuade people who are making good money to save because they've got this fat paycheck that is for the most part covering everything, and they don't feel like they need to put aside money in an account that's not earning anything.

Well, many of those people have lost their job during the pandemic. If you worked in the service industry or hospitality, and maybe you had a middle-level position as a manager or something, and now you're not working, that fat paycheck isn't coming in and now they're eyeing their retirement accounts to tide them over. And so, I'm hoping that they get the message that no matter what you earn, you have to try to save something. And obviously, if you don't make a lot, that's harder; but if you make good money, you need to use this pandemic of what happened as a wake-up call that you need to make sure you have a cash cushion. Even as you're saving for retirement and investing, that you still need to have liquid cash so that you don't have to tap those portfolios before you're ready in your retirement years. Because if you had to tap them now in the markets down, that's heartbreaking that you would have to tap that money.

Benz: That's what I wanted to ask about, because the CARES Act did loosen up the restrictions around tapping 401(k) or IRA assets prior to retirement for people who have experienced hardship related to COVID-19. So, do you think retirement savings should be more accessible prior to retirement, less accessible? I know there are different schools of thought on this topic.

Singletary: You know, I waver on this and I really waver on anything because I'm a very black and white kind of girl. But I think for lower-income families to persuade them to invest for retirement, there has to be a mechanism where they can easily tap that money in times of trouble because they are hit first. When there's a storm, when there's a crisis, they get it first before anybody else. And I've heard from this community; I'm part of this community who say, I don't want to lock up my money in retirement in case I need it. Obviously, we want them to do both--have some savings in retirement. So, I think that we do need to have some things in place. And we do. Many companies allow people to borrow from their retirement. There's a penalty, however, if you take it out, as you well know and many of your listeners know, before you're 59.5.

And so, some of the things that came into place because of CARES Act I think was a good thing. Because the reality is, even though we preach, please don't touch this money; keep it there as best you can. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime major crisis. And I don't think we can wag, or should we wag fingers at people for having to tap that money if they haven't had savings. This is not the time to say you should have had savings. This is the time to make it easier for them to tap the money they need to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table. And so, the CARES Act allows people to pull money out either through a withdrawal or a loan and then, without that penalty, that 10% penalty for the withdrawal. And then it gives them an opportunity to pay it back over three years, whether it's a withdrawal or a loan. And I love that. And with a loan, there are no payments. I think it was six months or a year, I can't recall right now. I think it's a year. So, it gives them time before they have those payments kick in. And I think that was the right thing to do, to let people tap that. And as I've written, now, if you feel like you have to do that, please only take what you absolutely need, because you still got that tax hit facing you, even if you don't have to pay that 10% penalty.

Ptak: Say someone who's listening is in a financial crunch. They've suffered an income reduction or perhaps they've lost their job and don't have enough of a cushion to help them through. What advice do you give people in that situation right now? How can they make the least-bad choice?

Singletary: The first piece of advice may surprise people. I think that you need to take some time to breathe, get some therapy, talk to someone. Because if you've been working all your life and you're a hard worker, which many people are, losing your job or being furloughed, or having your income cut because your hours have been cut, can be devastating to your ego and to your pride. And you need to grieve that. Spend the time that you need to grieve that. And then, don't take too long because now you've got to make some hard decisions. And as I've written in my column in The Washington Post, I thought about this in the sense of an emergency room. And so, I've encouraged people to triage their bills. So, if you've ever been in an emergency room that's been really crowded, you may come in with a sprained ankle, and you might be sitting there for an hour and someone comes in and they are immediately taken to the back and you're sitting there going, wait, wait a minute, I was here first.

But you know in those situations, the hospital does something called triage. They treat the most critical patients first--that person came in maybe having a heart attack. Of course, they should go first. And you need to look at your bills the same way. If you have lost your job at whatever income level, because it's just as devastating if you're making $20,000 or if you're making $200,000, then you need to say, I can only pay the essentials, the necessities--that's roof over your head, food on the table, utilities, and if you have a car loan. So that way you can maybe look for another job or part-time job. And then everything else has to be put on hold, especially your credit card debt. If you've got credit card debt, call the lenders; ask for forbearance or payment pause. I'm not suggesting that you ignore it and not take care of it. But if you don't get help from them and they won't let you--but many have--then you can't pay that bill. And I know for many people that is just heresy, because they're like, ""What? I've always been paying my bills on time."" You got to step out of that. You're in the emergency room now. You are the critical patient with the heart attack, and you can only do a certain amount. Pay what's necessary.

If you've had some disruption of income, but you're still making a good check, try to keep everything going, but only the essentials. Say you had a lot of credit card debt, and you were on an aggressive debt-payment plan where you're trying to get rid of it--pull that back and just make the minimum payments, because you need to free up that cash. And then, if you're working and your income is OK now, this is the time to take maybe those savings that you're having--you're not commuting maybe, you're working from home, you're not eating out, you're not spending on a credit card--take that and build up your savings account and/or increase your retirement savings.

Benz: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. Do you think apart from the people who are in dire straits for various reasons, do you think that for people who are still working, the current crisis might have some positive side effects in terms of forcing them into some discipline around saving, because there just aren't that many opportunities to go to restaurants and do things that they would otherwise spend money on?

Singletary: Absolutely. There are so many people in this terrible crisis who have seen a silver lining. They have seen their expenses go down, so they actually can see that they have the money to save. Just to give you an example, my niece and her husband, he has some student loan debt, and they're good savers, and they live below their means. But he's got some student loan debt. And they called me up and they said, what should we do because they're offering us this pause, but we have all this extra money because our kids are not in daycare--so they're saving on that. And I said, oh my gosh, don't take that student-loan forbearance; take all that money and pay down that student loan, because right now anything you put on that student loan is at zero-percent interest, which means all your payments go to principal. And I worked out a plan with them that over the next six months they can get rid of that student loan debt by all the savings they have every month--not eating out, childcare, all the things that I mentioned. And so, they were like, are you serious? I said, absolutely. By September, you could have all that debt gone.

And then, there are other people that I've worked with who were out and spending and planning for vacation, right? Lots of people have canceled vacations. They've taken that vacation money--and I have talked to so many people who have gotten out of credit card debt or greatly reduced some of their debt by all the money that they're saving because of the stay-at-home orders.

Benz: I want to talk about financial helps, because I assume that some of our listeners are people who are in good financial shape, but they have loved ones in their lives who are struggling. So, how can they balance helping alongside making sure that they're not jeopardizing their own financial well-being? And this is really an evergreen issue. I'm sure you encounter a lot of older adult parents who are retired who grapple with how much to help adult children. How do you approach that topic of financial help?

Singletary: So, when it comes to financial health, and I'm sure your listeners maybe have heard this analogy, but if you have just act like you haven't heard it before. So, when I was a new parent, for the first time I flew on an airplane with my infant child, I remember the flight attendant saying: When the oxygen mask drops down, if you're with a child--or somebody acting like a child--to put your mask on first and then attend to your child. And my motherly instinct right away was like you are out of your mind. I am going to take care of my child first. And as they kept going with the instruction, she said: Because if you're gasping for air, you're both going to pass out because you then won't be able to help your child or yourself. And that's the same thing with your financial health. You have to first make sure that you've got your emergency fund, that you have your financial house in order, and that you're saving for retirement--you've done all the things, you're paying down your debt. And then, if you have extra--and many people do--you give from that extra. You give from your abundance, because you can't forgo paying your mortgage payment or your rent payment or something to help someone else. Make sure you're financially healthy because then maybe they come live with you. And so, that's what I tell people. Give out of your abundance, give out of your extra. And you ought to actually have a plan for that all the time.

My husband and I have always had a ""give out of our extra"" fund. We actually have a bank account where we put money in to help relatives. Certainly, no one could predict it--well, I guess some people did predict the pandemic--but there are times when you know that people that you love, and friends and family, are going to be in financial trouble. And if you are that person who has a giving heart, then just plan for it. And so, once you've taken care of your financial health, you're making sure that you've got your oxygen mask on, then come up with a plan to help other folks. Because you don't want to give so much that it hurts you. But you also don't want to enable bad behavior. But right now, people are in such dire need, I think you need to not worry about whether somebody was financially irresponsible. You need to just reach out and help.

And if you're concerned they might not use the money properly, what we do is when we help people, we pay the vendors or the creditors directly. So someone you know has lost their job, and they can't make their rent, just pay the rental office yourself if you're worried about someone who may not have been financially responsible. But I really do believe that this day and this crisis, that if you can, you should, because I truly believe to whom much is given much is required.

Benz: I want to talk about wealth and income inequality, because COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on people of color, not just in terms of the virus, but also in terms of the economic impact. So, you recently wrote an article in which you argued that coronavirus could widen the already-wide wealth gap for people of color, especially with regard to housing wealth. So, let's talk about that. And I'd like to get your thoughts on whether the 2007 through 2009 Great Financial Crisis is instructive in terms of what we should expect to see this financial crisis.

Singletary: Right. So, I wrote about a report out of the Urban Institute Housing Policy Center. And so, they were looking at past crisis, past storms, and how they impacted homeownership for African Americans. And they looked at the Great Recession and Hurricane Katrina--Katrina was in 2005 and obviously the Great Recession 2007 to 2009. And so, they looked at it and sure enough, it impacted it in the sense that homeownership went down because homeownership obviously is connected to jobs, and we know that in all of these storms--the Great Recession, Hurricane Katrina, and now even COVID-19--that the frontline workers, those low-income workers, many disproportionately made up of African Americans and minorities, they lost their jobs first. And so, they're going to be unemployed longer, and they're going to have a harder time on the back end of this becoming employed again. And so, all of that impacts your ability to get a home loan.

And then, there are other factors--there's still employment discrimination; there's still a huge pay gap. African Americans with the same resume, same job history are less likely to get a call back for a job than white Americans. We see study after study that shows that. And so, they can't recover as fast. And without a job, without employment, without equal pay, it impacts their ability to buy a home. And we know that home equity for most Americans, even though Morningstar is all about investing, but we know that most Americans, their net worth is tied up in the equity in their home.

When I looked at this report, one of the things that was just disheartening is that in 2020 the homeownership rate for African Americans is about the same as it was when housing discrimination was legal. And that's pretty tragic. Because it's through home equity that families are able to leave money to their heirs, maybe borrow from it to help somebody with a down payment, even though I don't recommend that. I'm not a big fan of pulling equity out of your home other than for mandatory home improvements. But yet it is there for you in times of trouble that you can tap. It's one of those things that we say don't go tap your retirement fund; don't tap your home equity. But then there are cases where you do have to do that. Maybe you're not tapping it for yourself, but you're trying to help extended family members, but at least it's there. Well, we do know that because of, again, discriminatory practices, African American homes in similar communities with the same type of amenities don't appreciate the same as that home in a predominantly white neighborhood. We feel that COVID-19, because it hit so quickly and it hit so hard, and we may be dealing with this for another 18 months to two years, it will surely impact the ability of African Americans to buy a home.

Benz: Michelle, I was struck by that same statistic that you referenced that African American homeownership is now about 41%, close to where it was when race-based housing discrimination was legal. So, for some context, the rate of homeownership among whites in the U.S. is over 70%. How does this get better? What are the prescriptions that you favor? Are they policy prescriptions? How do we address this?

Singletary: Well, we address it on different avenues. There has to be a convergence of a lot of things. So, right now, or at least as of 2018, the homeownership rate for African Americans is about 41% and as you mentioned, over 70% for white Americans, I think about 72%. And so, two avenues--one, definitely policy. Perhaps, home down-payment programs to make homeownership more accessible to people who are making; looking at lending and making sure that there's no discrimination in lending. We still don't have as much data as we need to look at to see if there are any differences in the interest rates that are being offered to African Americans. We saw, for example, during the Great Recession, that there was a lot of predatory lending going on. African Americans with the same credit profile, income, everything being as equal as it can be, getting loans at a much higher rate and at those funky mortgages where you could pause a payment and no documentation, and all kinds of craziness compared to white Americans. And so, we need to be sure that homes that are similarly situated in Black neighborhoods are not appraised at a lower value than homes in white neighborhoods. So that's the policy side, encouraging--and I should add this in, just affordable--housing for one thing; it's not just having the policies in place but making sure people can get homes at an affordable rate.

And then, on the personal side, obviously, more financial literacy, trying to help people understand when is the right time to buy a home. Like right now, one of my top questions people are asking me is should I buy a home, the interest rates are low, the prices are down. And my standard answer is, you should buy a home when it's the right time for you to buy a home. Don't look at the interest rate, don't look at what the market is doing, because none of that's going to matter if you're not prepared for that mortgage. And when I say prepared, now, I'm rough, right? I'm rough. People don't want to ask me should they buy a home, because I'm going to just hurt your little heart. So, if you've got a lot of student loan debt, you've got credit card debt, even a car loan, I just think you should get rid of all of that before you buy a home.

Now, I know people who are listening thinking, well, then none of us will own a home. But I don't want people dragging six-figure student loan debt into a home. I don't want them dragging credit card debt into a home. I want them to have an emergency fund before they buy a home. Because anybody who owns a home knows it's a money pit and you need resources to be able to maintain that home and stay in it when there is a crisis. I don't want you to go into a home when you have so much debt that if a crisis hits and you lose your job, you're going to be in trouble right away. I need you to have a cushion, and that may mean putting off homeownership for a while. I'm a big believer in homeownership, but at the right time. I think that's so important to look at--when is the right time for you to own a home. And oftentimes when we look at homeownership, we compare it to rents and the mortgage. But there is so much more to owning a home. And it's not an even comparison. Because if my toilet breaks, I got to pay somebody to come in. If my heater breaks, I've got to replace that. If you're in an apartment, your landlord is responsible for that. And then in times of crisis, if you can't afford that rent, it's not ideal. And I'm not suggesting you do this if you don't have to, but you can pick up and move. You will still owe that, but you don't owe it right away. You can take care of it, it will be a debt, but you can at least find other housing. You're kind of stuck with a mortgage and it makes it much more difficult to pick up and move to even go where the jobs are if you've got to try to sell a house in a market that's down. And so, I think those are the things that we have to look at when we look at homeownership. But we do know that homeownership is one of the keys to closing that wealth gap among African Americans. It's not the only key; it's not the top key; it's one of the keys.

The other ones we talked about earlier in the interview--employment, making sure there's as much as we can getting rid of employment discrimination and closing the pay gap. All of those things together will help close the wealth gap between African Americans and white Americans. And someone might be saying, why should I care about that? Because let’s be real, people will ask that. Because when we are all able to live well and have a living wage and be able to pass on money to our heirs, we all are better for it. When you have a society where the wealth gap is so huge, we have a situation like we have now--where when those folks fall, it brings all of us down, and we don't want that. There is enough for everybody.

Ptak: You mentioned student debt. For a lot of young people just starting out, taking out loans to fund higher education seems completely logical--the connection between education and income is clear. But how can young people of color thread that needle, investing in education without over-borrowing and saddling themselves with more debt that they can reasonably handle?

Singletary: Yeah, that's a great question. It's a question for everybody, not just African Americans. But we do know that African Americans end up having to borrow more because their family has less to be able to help them with and then when they borrow, they end up not being able to finish because they can't borrow enough. It gets to a point where it's too much and they drop out. So, then they have the debt and no degree, and that puts them further behind. And so, what I try to encourage while we're trying to have policy changes where we need to increase--the Pell Grant, which is the grant for low-income families, we need to have more scholarships and aid, state aid. We know that many states pull back from helping their college systems. So, until that happens--and it absolutely needs to happen--we cannot put all of this on families, particularly minority families who are already struggling for a number of reasons. But what I try to encourage people is that let's look at college in a different way. You can have the same college experience as we seem to normalize. So, you maybe go to community college for two years, and then transfer to the four-year university; perhaps you commute instead of live on campus. Or you maybe take a year off and work and save a little bit and then go. I mean, they're all ways that we need to look at it, because all they hear is go to college at any cost, any cost, but it's too high for them.

And the same applies for everybody. Many people send their kids to school and rack up an amazing amount of debt for themselves and their children. And I just think that is a huge mistake. These adults starting off their lives with this burden of debt, which then prevents them from saving for retirement, taking advantage of their 401(k) and delays homeownership, which we know helps build equity. So, it's like a domino effect. We need to make sure that all the dominoes are lined up and that they're not tipped over by different practices.

Benz: So, a related issue is that people of color tend to be underrepresented in the financial-services industry. The Bureau of Labor's numbers indicate that 82% of financial advisors are white. So, what are the implications for people of color seeking advice from this industry?

Singletary: Well, you know, they don't get good advice, right? It's such a tough thing, because for a lot of people, it's hard for them to pay for financial advice. It seems counterintuitive to them that I should pay someone to help me make money. But I always tell people, if you have a toothache and you need your wisdom tooth pulled out, you're going to pay a dentist to do that; you can't do it yourself. And for many people, understanding how to invest and how to make sure your portfolio is well balanced and diversified, and like right now, that your portfolio is situated. That yeah, you might have to take a loss, but long term you're going to still be OK because you have the right amount of assets at the right level. And people need help with that.

The financial industry has always sort of shunned African Americans, thinking they don't have money--and there are some that don't--but there are a lot who do, and they need help. But they didn't think to look at their pricing models. They have to figure out a way to price it so that people don't feel that they have to pay $10,000 for a financial plan, which they just can't afford. But eventually, you can make money off these clients, reasonably priced services, over time if you work with them from the time that they start their full-time job until when they have more resources to put into investments. And people like to see people who look like them. They trust them. There are certain dynamics of communities that you need to understand. There are certain things you can and cannot say that people will be skeptical about, because let's not forget that African Americans were taken advantage of for decades, and so they're very leery of financial planners; they are very leery of banks; they are very leery of government for right reasons.

So, you have to understand that. You've got to come at them in a different way. You've got to go where they are--whether there's some sort of convention hall, they go to church, they are in the community center. That's where you have to go to reach out to them. My husband and I have had a financial planner, I don't know, 15 years or more. And we had an African American financial planner, and I'm telling you, I'm not joking, I sent her an email before this all came crashing down--I was going through some paperwork and I saw her plan for us from about 15 years ago. And we followed every piece of her advice and we are in such better shape. One of the things that she got us to do is not be so conservative in our portfolio, because I was like I'm only going to be in bonds. I don't know about you all, but I'm not going to be in the stocks. And she was like, no, no, Michelle, you've got to do this. You can't be so scared. Because that's all I learned from my grandmother. My grandmother was all about savings bonds and CDs. She just had savings products; she saw nothing else. And so, she got me to realize that that was not going to give me the growth that I needed. And she encouraged us to save for our children in a 529 plan. Even though I work in personal finance, when I first started, I didn't know a lot about it. And she talked me through it, and we opened up 529 plans for all our children. And we sent and are sending all three of our children to college debt-free because of their 529 savings plans, because we saved for them over 20 years.

And I looked at all her recommendations, and I sent her an email. I was hoping that it still worked. And I said thank you because you put us on the path to wealth. And we wouldn't have probably done that had we had to sit down with a white person. We just wouldn't have trusted him. They didn't know us. And she understood who we were. For example, my husband and I tithe, which means we give 10% of our income to our church as a tithe. In many communities, religious communities, people pledge a certain part of their income to support their religious organization. And she saw that, which is a great amount of money, and we had met with another planner and he was like, what are you doing that for? You've got to do this. And she was like, oh, yeah, I get that. And it was done. There was no talk about why are you doing that. I would have found that offensive. But she understood that that was important to us as African American Christians. And so, that's why it's important that you understand and you have people who can understand some of those nuances of dealing with people from another race or whether they are women or Black or a Latino, so that you can get past the barriers that they have of mistrust.

Ptak: If we have financial-services professionals who might be listening and regard a more diverse workforce as a worthwhile goal, what tangible steps could they take to help improve things?

Singletary: Well, it is so important to have a diverse workforce and I cannot believe that we are still having this conversation in 2020, that somehow people don't realize that you need diversity. You need diversity in age. You need diversity … You need older financial planners and younger financial planners; you need women financial planners; you need Black financial planners; you need Hispanic or Latino. You need planners who are people of faith. You have to embrace this idea that even though there are differences, we're still the same. We still need to all save for retirement; we still are all going to age; we're still going to all need to pay for long-term care. And how do you do that? Well, if you don't have them, or you can't find them, then train them. What about going to the colleges, community college, four-year universities and identify math majors, science majors, people who are OK with numbers and say, hey, this is a great career path, let us help you; maybe scholarship programs, to help identify STEM African Americans, Latinos, women who may want to go into financial services. Don't just sit back and say, oh, we can't find anybody, because you haven't put in any money or time to train people to bring them up to serve a population that absolutely needs your help.

Benz: A key focus of your books as well as your columns is this idea of living within your means. You were in the financial-independence movement before FIRE was even a thing.

Singletary: That's right.

Benz: Let's talk about why you think frugality and financial independence have really taken off in recent years? What were the catalysts to make this trendier than it was maybe when you first started talking about it?

Singletary: I think there are a lot of younger adults in their 20s and 30s and even maybe stretching to 40, who are saying, you know what, I really don't want to work in this job, this clog job till I'm 65, 70. I want to explore; I want to travel; I want to spend time with my children; I want to not work from 9 to 5 for my entire life and at the end of it be tossed out in a layoff. You don't even get a gold watch anymore. You don't even get a pension anymore. And I totally agree with that. Lots of people characterize the FIRE movement with--they don't want to work, and they want to just sort of lay back. Absolutely. Because we know that the companies don't necessarily … They're not loyal to us. And so, we don't necessarily have to be loyal to them in a sense of devoting our entire life to them at the detriment of our health and our happiness. And I think that's what they're saying.

And they are not saying they don't want to work. They just want the freedom to work the way they want to. And I love the FIRE movement. I love that and I wish more people would embrace it. Gallup did a survey. They said most people don't even know what FIRE is. But frugality--people sort of think of frugality is self-denial. That's how they define it. Like you're like not giving yourself something. But I don't look at frugality like that at all. I look at frugality as freedom so that if I can afford to live below our means--and we are talking about people who can actually afford to do that. There's some people who are … They're just trying to put food on the table. So, we're not talking about those folks, although we do need to figure out a way to have a living wage. And part of that is also having affordable healthcare. But let's set that aside and talk about middle income, upper-middle-income people who have the ability to live below their means or live on less.

I'm a huge believer in that, so that you can have some freedom. By living on less, that's how we found the money to put in our 529 plans for our children. And now, we have changed their life, their financial legacy, because now they won't graduate with any debt and they can go and do the things that they were gifted to do. Two of my kids--one of my kids is in STEM; he's a math major. But my daughters, one is a social worker, and one wants to be a special ed teacher. So, we know that those professions don't make a ton of money, but now they can embrace these careers and do what they were gifted to do. My daughter, I call her like a child whisperer; she gets children, she loves being around them. She's really good at it. And my social worker daughter, she's really empathetic. That's exactly what she should be. But we discourage kids from going into some of these fields by saying, you're not going to make a lot of money. And I think that's a disservice.

I believe in the STEM trajectory. My son is in it. But not everybody is supposed to be in there. That's just not for them. And so, by living below our means we have given our children the freedom to be who they want to be and pursue the career that is best for them. And yeah, my daughters might not make as much as my son at one point, but they won't be dragging debt. We have taught them how to live below their means. And they will be able to have a career and have a good life and buy a home and do all the things that we aspire to do in the middle class without having a lot of debt and a lot of financial pressure, because we’ve taught them the benefit of being frugal. And I just think we should not look at it like, that means I can't eat out, or I can't have a vacation. It might mean that, but only for a season so that you can get yourself in a position that you have enough money to do what you want to do so that you don't have to work yourself into the grave. I mean, if you want to work into your 80s, great, good for you. But maybe you don't want to do that. Or maybe you want to free yourself up to work with children. Or maybe you know what, you just want to drive a bus, you like driving a bus. There's nothing wrong with those service positions. And they can be possible if people live below their means and maybe you have multigenerational housing or some other things that you put in place to make that life workable for you and affordable.

Ptak: A corollary to frugality is being mindful about spending. So, my question is, how can people be more mindful about their spending to ensure they are spending in a way that aligns with their values and what they're trying to achieve? It's obviously a very big topic. But do you have any concrete practices that people might incorporate into their lives in the way they spend?

Singletary: I do actually. So, before you start figuring out the budget--because people always ask me, OK, so what budget template do you use, what budget app? Or do you recommend this, or do you recommend that? And I say, you know what, all you need is a back of an envelope. People are not rich because they don't have some sort of budgeting app. They're not rich because they don't have a plan. You don't have a plan for your life. You have to have a financial plan. And by that, I don't mean the traditional sense of where your investments are going to go; insurance. I mean, what do you want to do with the money that you make? No matter what you make, it's a limited amount. You have a limited amount of time. What do you want to do with that?

And so, early in my life and early in my marriage with my husband, we sat down, and we looked at, OK, where do we want to be in 20, 30, 40 years with the money that we are bringing in? What do we want to do with it? So, one of the first things we decided is that we wanted to give back. That's why we tithe. That's our priority. Giving is not at the bottom of our budget. It is at the top. We give first before we even pay for our mortgage because that was a priority for us. So, we put that on paper. Then we knew we wanted to have kids. We said, OK, we want to send them to college debt-free. OK, let's set up the 529 plan. And then, we wanted to be able to have money that we can help relatives. Because we're minorities many of our relatives are still struggling, still trying to make it. And so, we wanted to be able to help them up. So, we put the money aside to help. For example, we helped my brother with the down payment on his home. We helped send his child to school--to college while we were saving for our own children. This was all part of our plan like a mission and vision statement.

So, before you do anything, meet with a planner, figure out, sit down. Even if you are 20, 30, 40--sit down. You make this amount; you want to do what with it? Maybe you want to travel; maybe travel is your thing. All right, let's build that into the plan. But if you want to travel, that means you can't buy lunch every day; you can't buy a car every four years. If travel is your thing, go ahead and do it. That's why you will probably never hear me tell people don't buy expensive lattes--that's a big thing in personal finance. Cut out the coffee budget. I'm not going to tell you to do that because I'm not a coffee drinker, but my daughter and my husband are. And she just loves a good cup of java. So, you know what, if that's your thing, make that part of your plan. Because if having a cup of coffee is going to prevent you when you go to work, from slapping your coworker because you work in a crazy place, I'm going to need you to get that java. Put that into your plan. But if you're going to get that expensive cup of coffee, then bring in lunch. If you're going to get that expensive coffee, then maybe you keep your car for 10 or 15 years. There are trade-offs. So, figure out what makes you happy and spend your money in that. I don't get my hair done a lot. But some women are like, I got to go to the beauty shop every week. Put that in the plan. But then, cut something else out. You can't do everything.

So, if your plan says this is what's important to me--because we talk about values in terms of the long-term things like retirement and sending our kids to college, but there are everyday things that we value too. A trip to the beauty shop--maybe you've got little kids and that's your time to just let go, ah, peace under the hairdryer. Put that into the plan. Don't cut that out. I don't want you to cut that out. If you like going to Starbucks, go to Starbucks and get your coffee, but you've got to cut something else out. That's part of the plan. So, what I tell people do is, get out an index card or tear off a sheet of paper. You don't have to go buy something special. Write it on your computer; put it on your iPhone--the top things you want to do with your money financially. And that will help you stick to your plan and pull it out when you're tempted to do something that's not part of the plan.

And that's how my husband and I have been able to save … We would pull out, ""We want to send our kids to college."" OK, so we can't take this really expensive vacation that we want to do, because sending them to college is more important than sitting on a beach in sand. We'll get to do that later. What do we want to do? We want to pay off our mortgage before we retire, so that we can't do this; this is part of the plan. And whenever we're tempted to steer from that, we look at that plan, we look at those bullet points. OK, this is not part of the plan.

Benz: My last question for you, Michelle, is about retirement savings. People of color on average are in much worse shape with respect to retirement savings. They are more reliant on Social Security as the sole asset in retirement. Benefits are lower from Social Security. They are more likely to be poor in retirement. So, are there any policy prescriptions that you favor that you think could help improve this, whether mandatory contributions if you have a job or making it easier to contribute if your workplace doesn't have a 401(k), which is pretty common? Can you talk about that?

Singletary: So, I'm going to talk about two ways. So, one, we can't put it all on the individual. Why [do] African Americans have less? So, let's put all of those numbers in context. So, we are less likely to get paid what we deserve based on our experience; we are more likely to be discriminated against in employment; less equity. We come in from behind on a lot of things, and this whole Black Lives Matter movement isn't just about police issues. It's about the whole economic discrimination that has gone on. And you cannot ignore that. We can't put it all on the individual--if they just put more in their 401(k). But they don't have that ""just to put in their 401(k)."" So, that's one thing.

But then on the other side is that we have to make a good case to show them the numbers that the sooner you start, the more you'll have and the less you'll have to put in and that if your work doesn't have a 401(k), perhaps you do an IRA. But then, we know that automatic payments help people save. So, policies that would help people, for example, take their 401(k)s with them or some sort of way that people can have the same benefit of a 401(k) not necessarily locked to a particular job. So, automatic savings ways and maybe tax breaks; some incentives for people to save, which will help all of us in the long run really, if more people, because it would be less strain on the Social Security system. So, it's both personal responsibility but also policy changes that will help those numbers so that we are not so far behind.

Ptak: Michelle, this has been a really enjoyable and insightful conversation. Thank you so much for your time and your perspectives today. We've really enjoyed it.

Singletary: Oh, thank you.

Transcript

Jeff Ptak: Hi and welcome to The Long View. I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: Our guests on the podcast today are Kiersten and Julien Saunders. Together they blog about finance and life at the website richandregular.com. And they’re also the authors of a new book called Cashing Out: Win The Wealth Game By Walking Away. In addition, they co-host the rich & REGULAR podcast. After discovering the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement in 2012, they proceeded to pay off $200,000 in debt and walked away from their corporate jobs before turning 40. Kiersten and Julien, welcome to The Long View.

Julien Saunders: Thank you so much for having us.

Jeff Ptak: It’s our pleasure. Thank you so much for joining. It sounds like, Julien, you discovered the Financial Independence, Retire Early, or FIRE movement, first. Can you talk about that, what you were doing for your career at the time FIRE came on your radar and what appealed to you about it?

Julien Saunders: I believe my first introduction to the movement was during my grad school days. This may have been like the late 2000s and it was really just in between those moments when I was studying and not wanting to study, and I would find myself just venturing on the internet and exploring real estate blogs and wanting to learn about real estate, making money. And somehow that rabbit hole led me to FIRE blogs and that wonderful world that really doesn’t exist anymore and has since evolved into all kinds of multimedia content. But I just found it really fascinating at the time that people were like sharing their net worth and talking about their investment strategies and really evangelizing for this way of life and this way of thinking. And I was just really just fascinated by it.

I had more than one motivation—I think at that time was really just a matter of my interest in all things money and business and wanting to make as much money as possible so that I could have a good quality of life. But when I started looking at that and juxtaposing it against some of my other interests, which were really around social justice issues and wanting to be a positive role model in my family and in my community. I really started to think about creative ways to tie the two together because it felt as if, with respect to the Black community, that we’ve made progress in so many other areas, but wealth seemed to be one of those things that we were lagging behind. And so that’s really when the ball started rolling, I would say around the late late 2000s.

Christine Benz: We want to come back to some of the things you’ve just mentioned, Julien. But Kiersten, I want to bring you in because it sounds like you needed some convincing to proceed on this journey toward FIRE. Can you discuss your evolution? It sounds like you and Julien began to talk about some of these things. Can you talk about where you were and how you came over to embrace this idea of financial independence?

Kiersten Saunders: I definitely needed some convincing. When Julien first brought the idea to me, it was like immediately no—it felt very extreme, and it felt like people weren’t enjoying their lives. And you have to remember back then, at this time I was in my late 20s, I was doing well in my career. I had a very robust social life that included expensive brunches on the weekends. And back then, the blogs were written anonymously and they were really focused on all of the ways that people were saving money and then investing the difference. So, there wasn’t a lot of narrative there. There weren’t pictures and stories like everybody had this pseudonym and code names that they were writing behind. And so, my evolution really started to happen, when I discovered different voices. When I discovered women like Tanja Hester and Paula Pant, that could really paint a picture for me that allowed me to see me embracing some of these ideals without completely removing my identity from my life.

And then this real shift happened when I went to a conference and we actually met people who were financially independent in real life, that weren’t bloggers, but were just living this lifestyle. And that was when the magic happened. I realized that is exactly what I want to be doing. Waking up when I want to, spending my time in a way that’s aligned to my values, and so I was all on board after that.

Jeff Ptak: You two became evangelists for financial wellness and began to pay a lot of attention to how you were managing your household assets. Who or what were your main influences on that journey? You mentioned Tanja and Paula, it sounds like they were pretty pivotal influences. Who or what else influenced you as you made your way on that journey?

Julien Saunders: That’s a great question. I think the first person as I’m thinking about it, I think like a lot of other Americans I remember reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. But I wouldn’t call that an influence it was really just like an entry point and something that introduced me to personal finance. But I will say Dr. Dennis Kimbro who is a professor, but in many ways in the Black community, seen as almost like the godfather of personal finance. He certainly was a huge influence on me. A couple of books that he wrote, Think and Grow Rich, which is a bit of a play on Napoleon Hill’s book, but he added one with a bit of a Black focus, which was really intriguing to me. And it was one that was recommended by several mentors. And the next one was The Wealth Choice where he really just brought it to life and that was important for me because it helped me to more sharply envision myself as some of the people that he was writing about and interviewing and sharing insights into the way that they thought and the way that they managed their money. I don’t know if you had any other influences at the time.

Kiersten Saunders: It wasn’t so much a person; it was more the lifestyle for me. It was more of a what than a who. I’m very reward-driven and so the idea of being able to do things like sleep in, which was at the time very important to me, pre-children. Those were the things that I looked forward to. I looked forward to taking vacations and not having credit card debt on the back end and being able to splurge on the things that matter to us, like I was more focused on the rewards of money.

Christine Benz: You two retired from your corporate careers before you were 40. And I want to talk a little bit about how you did that because there’s this whole gradation of people in the FIRE movement where you’ve got the, I guess they call it Lean FIRE, like the extreme frugality people and then the people who have high incomes that, somehow made their way to FIRE, but maybe they have a little higher-cost lifestyle. How would you plot yourself on that spectrum of FIRE practitioners?

Julien Saunders: For sure the latter end. I’m not a big fan of any of these labels. I really don’t use them because they’re pretty widely accepted within the community and in the media. But, for sure, we credit having high income and discipline as major sources as to why we were able to accomplish what we were able to accomplish. And I just remember thinking at the time, you know when you’re not earning, I remember when I was earning like $40,000 a year and was like the most amount of money that I ever thought and then was earning $75,000 a year and that was like a dream come true. Because I remember reading job descriptions and thinking, what do people who make this much money do with all this money? I just couldn’t imagine it until it actually happened.

Even in those moments I would look up the organization and look around and think about people who made even more. And I just found myself continually asking this question, what are we doing with all this money? And quite honestly, why are they still working? I just couldn’t understand it. But yeah, all that to say, for sure, we were very fortunate to have earned high incomes and we would see people who earned even higher incomes but made very different choices as a bit of a cautionary tale because we didn’t want to be in our 50s and 60s and still needing to work to make ends meet or to help make up for decades past.

Jeff Ptak: As you embarked on your journey to financial independence, were there any key areas where you departed from the conventional wisdom about how to do it?

Kiersten Saunders: I think the biggest area that we departed from was this idea of having a rigid number or a rigid timeline before we considered ourselves financially independent, or maybe a better way to put it is able to take advantage of the benefits of financial independence. So, while traditional, conventional wisdom says you have to have 25 times your annual expenses before you’re financially independent and can quit your job. We realized that even if you don’t have 25 times your annual expenses, there’s still a whole lot of leverage you can do between working every single day for a salary and enjoying a life where working is optional. And so, we’ve decided to pursue a creative career, I guess you can call it a career, after we left the traditional workplace and were able to do that because of the portfolio that we have.

Christine Benz: How did you set your target for how much you would need to have set aside before you could quit those corporate jobs?

Julien Saunders: Well, that part was pretty simple. It was really just a matter of guesstimating how much we think we would need on an annual basis and looking at how much we would need in our portfolio today and then allowing that to compound over a number of decades. It was really just a matter of saying how much is enough, if you will. To be able to say, yeah, we’ll have more than enough based on what we anticipate we would need during reaching our traditional retirement ages, or when we can safely withdraw without penalty from our retirement accounts. It’s a moving target for a number of reasons for us—one because we have a child, and the costs of children is so wildly unpredictable. But even now with respect to supporting a parent—my mom is financially insecure and so we do support her financially today. And we’re lucky that we’re able to do that quite comfortably based on the number of income sources that we have.

And so all of that to say for us it was a matter of being able to reprioritize the things in our life that were important to us, which at this juncture is quality of life, health and our wellness, taking care of our son, spending as much time as we can with our parents in their golden years without having to worry about whether or not we are going to have enough in retirement. And so, we’re in a really comfortable spot right now and we’re still able to earn income, which makes it even a lot easier for us.

Kiersten Saunders: I think the term for our version of FI is Coast FI, where you front-load your traditional retirement and then you’re coasting in between your current age and traditional retirement age and you’re figuring out ways to cover your expenses and continue to invest.

Jeff Ptak: You mentioned enough a moment ago. In a lot of ways, social media seems to work against that concept when it comes to getting off, say the spending treadmill. As we know, social media can be full of people flaunting trappings of wealth. How would you recommend that people deal with that given that social media is a way of life for so many people?

Julien Saunders: It’s a great question. You used the word treadmill and I would say, getting off the social media treadmill is probably one of the best things that you can do, because you’re absolutely right, it sucks you in and it shows you a very curated and mostly false way of life in thinking, and even now we’re finding ourselves spending as little time as possible aimlessly surfing social media because there’s just not a lot of value there. And I think also given our platform, we really want to represent something else. We want to be a real-world example and social media algorithms don’t really cater to that. They want to see the sexy stuff, and the sizzle and all of those things. So, I think if that’s something, if you’re listening out there and you’re thinking that this isn’t something that you enjoy, I think honestly, just consider joining the group of people who actually just decided that they don’t want to do it anymore. And just continue to opt out because it can be very enticing and it’s only getting better or worse. The algorithm is getting better at feeding the things that you don’t want or need, but it’s worse for a lot of people who are spending time there.

Kiersten Saunders: At the same time, there’s the other side of that coin, where social media allows you to find community in ways that you wouldn’t be able to do locally. And for a lot of us who are pursuing countercultural means of financial progress, it’s the only way that you can connect with like-minded individuals through hashtags and communities. And so, I’d offer that piece of advice. You absolutely want to heed Julien’s caution and treat social media like the recreational drug that it is. But while recognizing that through the power of hashtags and challenges and communities, you can also find your next biggest supporter. We tend to lean on our friends and family and expect them to support every endeavor of our lives. But when it comes to money, sometimes that’s not possible and you haven’t met your biggest cheerleader yet or your accountability partner. I would encourage you to use social media for that, to join a couple of communities, tweak the algorithm, tell them you’re interested in money nerd stuff and the kinds of content that you want to see. And then let it work for you.

Christine Benz: That’s a great point. I want to talk about one of the most amazing parts of your story, which is that you had $200,000 in debt, that you were able to pay off in five years once you both got serious about this FIRE thing. Can you talk about that? I’d like to hear specifically if you have any hacks to share with people who have debt that they’d like to pay down in a similarly aggressive way.

Kiersten Saunders: It’s a great question because when we were doing this back in 2012, it was when we started, or 2013, a lot of the apps and tools that exist today weren’t around. And so, our biggest hack was using paper. We had a countdown calendar that we would post on the refrigerator. I bought it off of Amazon—it was like 100-day countdown calendar. And we knew what milestone would be associated with those 100 days. And we could build little celebrations along the way. We knew that, if we were on day 89 in 11 days, we could have a nice bottle of wine or whatever the splurge was. And then the other hack that we used was we would move the money as soon as it came into the account. I remember, we’d wake up on Friday morning, see the direct deposit hit and we already knew where that money was going to go. It wasn’t like we were letting it sit—it went out of the account almost as soon as it came in and we were using the rest of what was left to spend.

Paula has a name for this kind of budget, but you’re basically paying your debt down first and then you have what’s left is your budget. You don’t have to categorize anything; that’s all you have. Those were the two things. It was frequent, we normalized talking about money on a regular basis. We were super engaged with it. We weren’t looking at our debt as a boogeyman. We really looked at it as a creative challenge that we could work together to get rid of.

Julien Saunders: I would add a bit of a counterintuitive hack was to build in many celebrations along the way because it can be such a long and strenuous journey, and Kiersten actually had to teach me to do that because I was much more willing to go the hardcore frugal route. But it can get boring and repetitive. And to build in these little treats along the way really help to make the entire journey feel worthwhile.

Jeff Ptak: Rental properties and rental income had been part of your story for achieving financial independence, and I think that’s the case with many people in the FIRE community. But not everyone is cut out to be a landlord. What should people know before including real estate rentals as part of their financial plans?

Julien Saunders: There’s so much to know. There’s so much to learn. I think for us, because in the early stages I thought that it was going to be something that was a part of our lives forever. But, I was like dead set on it because that’s what I had learned, that’s what I was taught, and it had been role-modeled by so many people. I think one of the lessons that I would say now looking back, and now that we’ve sold all of our rental properties, is that I think you owe it to yourself to just be honest with yourself. To your point, it is not for everyone and that could change. You have to give yourself the right to change your mind. The other thing is I would say is, break the stigma of seeing selling as a bad thing. In order for you to buy property, someone has to sell. I think there’s this obsession with continuing to buy and buy assets. I’m like, all right, someone at some point had to be willing to sell and it doesn’t mean that you’re quitting or giving up. Sometimes you just may decide that this isn’t a good fit for you.

I think if you’re a newbie investor and you’re thinking about it, I think getting over that hump and not seeing selling as some type of failure or some admission of wrongdoing, I think is really important. Take advantage of all of the different perks and flexible options that you have that come with being a real estate investor or landlord, and that includes knowing when to fold them.

Christine Benz: Can you discuss your decision to unload your properties and not be in that business anymore?

Julien Saunders: It was really as we started to engage and think about how we can better leverage some of the skills that we learned in our corporate careers, as entrepreneurs and specifically within the creator economy, which is something that we really started paying attention to about five years ago. And the reality is it was just far more lucrative and far more fun than owning real estate. And so when I started thinking about where I wanted to spend my time and where I wanted to learn and it was like, all right I got to choose between really trying to master my understanding of taxes and insurance or do I really want to explore videography and photography? And so one was just that interest and I just didn’t really find owning or being a real estate investor fun the way that I used to. But secondly, it was just far easier and more fulfilling for me to drive traffic to a website to grow income or to grow a following on social media, it’s just far easier for me to do that than it was for me to raise rent. And far more lucrative. Quite frankly, some of the income that we would earn on an annual basis in one of our rental properties we could earn with content in a day.

So, it just didn’t really make much sense anymore and we started to look at our real estate portfolio as like a dreary bond portfolio. It was just holding me down. And we just didn’t want it anymore. It’s like, why are we doing this? And again, it was just out of this deep sense of commitment that, well, this is what you do when you’re building wealth. You’re supposed to own real estate, and we just found it not to be true. And so real estate led us to FIRE community, the FIRE community led us to the creator economy, and now we’re sort of straddling the fence between the two and it’s a really, really fun place to be.

Jeff Ptak: What steps did you take to protect your own plan against the kind of market downturn we’ve had so far this year?

Kiersten Saunders: I think it was a combination of things. We got a glimpse of the market downturn for a blip back in 2020 when the pandemic started. And at that point, we had a lot of cash on hand from liquidating our real estate and we started to really buckle down and determine what is our baseline budget, what is our, I forget the word for it, but what does Erin Lowry call it?

Julien Saunders: I don’t know, I always think skeletal.

Kiersten Saunders: Yes, but she has like a darker word for it, but like our skeletal budget. We got into a good rhythm during the pandemic because I had just left my job. Things were different. We had a lot of uncertainty. Obviously that little blip only lasted a couple of months. Now we are revisiting back to same practices that we’ve been using for this entire journey. I think the benefit of the FIRE community is that it teaches you how to be lean and creative in times where you don’t need it. So, when the environment, when the markets call for that same shift to happen so that you can free up capital to continue to invest. It feels very natural to you. It doesn’t feel like some sort of punishment or any negative connotation. You just recognize that this is natural, you see it as an opportunity. You welcome the uncertainty to an extent. And it becomes—we keep using the word creative challenge—but it really does become this creative challenge to figure out how to take advantage of the downturn.

Julien Saunders: I think it was also a little bit of just being willing to look back and be better students of your own investing history. Which is to say, we’ve been investing over a decade now. I’ve gone through a number of recessions. And so, you’ve got to really think back and say, well, what did I believe to be true in 2008, 2009, or that I believe to be true the last time we had prior hiccups and what can we learn from that? And in most cases it was really to just hold on, to just keep going, to trust that we’ve seen those gains, while we don’t know if the market will perform the way it did over the last 10 years, it really doesn’t matter. What’s done is done. And what we do know is that we are in a cycle. One of the best things you can do is to not overreact. And to, if anything, reevaluate your investing strategy and if you really trust it, you might even be willing to play a little bit more aggressively, than you did in the last 10 years.

Christine Benz: Julien, you mentioned at the outset of our conversation the racial income and wealth gap, which is a key interest of yours. It’s something we’ve talked about on a few occasions on the podcast as well. People of color have substantially lower net worth than white people. They’re less likely to have investments in the stock market or inherit wealth, and they’re also more likely to be poor in retirement. So, as you’ve studied the issue, what have you concluded? And this is a question for both of you. What do you think are the best ways to move the needle to improve financial wellness among people of color?

Julien Saunders: It is such a sad and big question. When we first started, when I first started really thinking of personal finance, wealth-building as a hobby, as an area of interest, I remembered that gap was somewhere in the ballpark of 6 or 8 to 1 or $6 to $8 for every $1 for Black families and now that number is anywhere between 11 and 13. And so we’ve seen it doubling. We’re seeing wealth inequality get worse and the pace in which it’s growing it seems to be getting faster. We haven’t even begun to see what the impact of COVID-19 and closing of businesses or loss of homes and property or any of those other things may do to make it even worse. What I do believe is that anything that is worthy of being deemed a crisis requires a multifaceted approach and I think that this is without question a crisis. And so, policy got us into this mess by and large and I think policy is going to have to play a role in getting us out of it. And we’ve seen a number of politicians offer some things from baby bonds to…

Kiersten Saunders: Reparations.

Julien Saunders: Reparations and guaranteed income, all of those things. But the last time I checked it certainly does not seem to be a top priority right now. This is where individual responsibility and people on a local level really need to buckle down and start looking at their finances and get more engaged with investing. I think one of the best things that we can do is to really lean into entrepreneurship, if for no other reason than because when done well, there is no cap to your income and that’s certainly not a perk that most jobs can afford us, and that’s why it’s such an important part of our message is to encourage people who are doing well and have the ability to walk away to do so with the interests of starting a business or becoming a business owner, whether or not you’re an active participant in it or not. So, all of that to say, if I had to boil it down to one thing, all of the above. We need government intervention, we need education, we need…

Kiersten Saunders: Income.

Julien Saunders: …culture, and social norms needs to be reevaluated so people feel a little bit more comfortable being or acting in a counterintuitive manner. All of the above is necessary.

Kiersten Saunders: And I just add on that we need role models. We need examples of people who have done the things right, whether it’s investing or saving heavily or retiring successfully. We need those stories. We need to update our examples of success for our community. We tend to highlight the extreme—the Oprah, the Obamas, the LeBrons. I was going to say the Joneses, but I don’t mean the ones that everybody compares them to. Just the regular Black Joneses. The Mitchells and the Saunders or whoever—these are people that you can admire as well and we need. We need refresh stories and those people to be celebrated just as much as we celebrate our celebrities.

Christine Benz: Julien, I want to follow up on the entrepreneurship point, because when you look at the data—and this cuts across racial lines—a lot of small businesses fail. People strike out and start businesses and they don’t succeed. So how do you talk to people about taking chances to pursue that entrepreneurial idea but also putting guardrails around it to ensure that it doesn’t completely blow up their whole financial plan?

Julien Saunders: That’s such a great question because it’s something that I do find when we talk about entrepreneurship with people. And what’s interesting is you use the term small business and that’s exactly the term that people use. But even when we’re talking about small business, I think people are thinking too big. You’re thinking about a multimillion dollar or even a million-dollar business or even a half-million-dollar business. You can be the worst photographer in the world and earn an extra $10,000 a year. Automate that to invest into an index fund and be a millionaire in 15 years. So those are the types of things that we’re talking about. So more specifically, it’s really just encouraging people to think smaller than a small business.

You should be thinking about micro enterprise, or you should be thinking about the power of self-employment—whatever language or word feels most comfortable—it’s really just about growing income and doing it in a way that is fruitful for you and comfortable for you. That doesn’t sacrifice your quality for life to some crazy extent, but that’s really what we actually encourage people to do, is to think smaller. I’m not asking you to create an app. I’m not asking you to break into tech or to have a brick and mortar. I’m simply asking you to think differently and to open yourself up to exceedingly wide number of ways to earn more income that exist today that didn’t exist even two years ago given the internet and social media. And so, again, it’s one of the reasons why we are so bullish on things like the creator economy. Because it is very lucrative and when done well can be a huge source of supplemental or even primary income for a great number of people.

Jeff Ptak: One topic we’ve discussed with other guests, including Michelle Singletary and Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, it’s what’s sometimes called the Black tax, which is a term that’s used to refer to the financial obligations that Black people often have to their family members and others in their community, and how that can affect their ability to get ahead. Can you talk about that issue and weigh in on whether that’s been a factor in your own journey?

Kiersten Saunders: It’s absolutely been a factor in our journey. It’s something that we’re dealing with now. It’s something that is much larger than the Black community as we enter into this crisis of shortage of healthcare professionals and just the care economy in general struggling after three years of the pandemic. I think the ways that people address this is very personal and it requires some internal work because it’s asking you to confront all of the cultural expectations and what you’ve been told to be true. What you’ve thought to be true for decades, it’s asking you to rethink the shape of your family and how that works. I know in our case we’ve decided to again subsidize Julien’s mom’s income. She lives off of Social Security, a very modest Social Security check. And that’s really it. She didn’t have additional retirement savings or a large portfolio to draw from. And so, for us, we’ve decided to supplement it because of the benefits that we get from having her close to us and our son. The generational wealth that we get from, not a monetary dollar, but just our son having access to elders and lots of people from our family.

I don’t have a broad answer to the question other than it’s something that we need to be talking about more often. It’s something that I’m hoping our fintech innovators and financial experts and gurus, creators of products and services can help us address because it’s out there. And right now, we just keep getting more like budgeting apps and roundup apps, and I think this is a problem that technology and community could really solve for.

Christine Benz: I wanted to ask about financial advice. When we delve into the data like the 2021 Ariel-Schwab Black Investor Survey found that 21% of Black Americans work with financial advisors. The percentage of white Americans with advisors was more than twice as high. Can you talk about that issue of seeking advice, getting advice? What are the key factors at play there, do you think, in terms of why Black people are less likely to use financial advisors?

Julien Saunders: I’m not an expert on the financial advisory industry, but I do know that there was a time where, and to a large extent it still exists today, where they really only worked with people who had a minimum amount of money to invest. And so, if you weren’t part of those people, then you weren’t a part of the target, they didn’t really focus their marketing efforts to you or to your community. And I think because historically the Black community has not had very much wealth, aside from a few examples here and there, I think a lot of the approach, the beliefs that advisors have still follow that old model. And a lot of the Black people themselves, still think about it the same way. They don’t think they have enough, much like they don’t believe they need a will because they think that that’s something that’s only relevant for rich people.

A lot of these outdated beliefs still shape the way that people think and act today. But I also think it’s important—going back to Kiersten’s point about role models—that’s so important. There aren’t enough people that we can point to in our neighborhood that we know and trust and can say. Oh well, I know the Johnsons. I know the Williams like well, yeah, they had a financial advisor. This is the type of life that they live. This is what they’ve done. This is what they’re doing or able to do, and they can credit it back to that. And so without those examples, the idea of having a financial advisor, the idea of having and building wealth still for a lot of us seems like something that you see on television or something that you just have heard is possible, but not something that you’ve actually been able to see and as a result can relate to. And so that’s why it’s so important for more of us to be role models. And to be outspoken about our experiences so that we can encourage a lot of other people to tap into some of the resources, and programs, and services that are available to them so that they can follow suit.

Jeff Ptak: Wanted to shift gears and ask you about education, paying for education specifically. As you know, education in the U.S. is very expensive and people can get into a lot of debt to cover it. And yet investing in higher education is practically a must for advancing in a career and accumulating wealth. How do you advise people to go about rightsizing their education purchases so they’re not putting themselves in financial jeopardy to pay for education?

Kiersten Saunders: I think our biggest advice is to begin with the end in mind and so really, really be crystal clear about the expectations that you have for this advanced degree or certification and then ask yourself if there’s an alternative. We know several people who go and get advanced degrees and they are looking at salary data that they got from typically the university, which I don’t know how honest that is. But they have these grand expectations for how much they’re going to make, but they never actually did the research of the market in their specific area. Talking to people who have jobs, looking at hiring managers, going to networking events to see if that number that they have in their mind is actually an accurate reflection of what the market is willing to pay right now. And that’s unfortunate because they spend all of this money and then they come out and the salary isn’t nearly what they expected.

I also think we’re in a time where education is going through a very similar revolution, like the labor market, and there are tons of new models that are popping up that are focusing on adult learners. We know that a lot of the jobs that will exist in 20 years don’t exist today, and a lot of companies are investing in upskilling the workforce so that they’re able to tackle these new roles and these new requirements of jobs for the future. And so there might be an alternative, whether it’s a boot camp course or some sort of community college option that’s local that is a very specific targeted skill set. Instead of getting a degree in marketing, you very specifically learn digital marketing or asset management, or some other derivative of a larger subject and you focus on that. And then that gives you a better chance of getting the job that you’re looking for or achieving the income or at least learning the specialized skill that’s going to get you the wages that you’re hoping to get.

Christine Benz: Can you talk about how you’ve approached funding higher education for your son and also balancing his education savings alongside your own goals of achieving financial independence at a fairly young age?

Julien Saunders: We opened; it was a very proud day. I remember it’s one of the things that we were so looking forward to when we decided to open up our son’s 529 account. So, we certainly take advantage of those types of investment vehicles to help offset some of the costs and I think that’s really the approach. It’s very difficult to set a target for something that has risen so fast as the cost of higher education. For us, we’re really focused on making sure that we can—we set a cap there and say all right this is how much we are able and interested in putting into these types of accounts, assuming he is interested in going to college. Because there’s certainly a lot of questions about whether or not the value of a college education will be worth it 10 or 15 years from now, or even the number of colleges that are even available. Like there’s a lot of consolidation going on and all those kinds of issues.

So that’s the big thing for us is really just to set money aside that way, but we really think about education. Kiersten uses the word woo-woo. And I don’t often use it, but I’m going to use it here—is that we really pay a little bit more attention to education as a whole, and not necessarily higher education or not specifically higher education, that’s to say that our son learns in a number of different ways. He can learn by working with us, he can learn by starting a business. He certainly learns when he travels with us and I don’t see that changing as he gets older. I genuinely don’t know if he is going to even be interested in going to college. But if he is, he will have some money that’ll help him to do that. But if he is interested in pursuing an entrepreneurial route or something else, I’m not necessarily against that either. So, give me a call in about 15 years and I’ll tell you what my final answer is.

Kiersten Saunders: Well, it’s interesting now and this is one of the things we’ve had to unlearn about parenting is that the milestone used to be when they graduated high school. When you’re in high school, that’s when you decide what’s going to happen after that. But the reality is these kids are able to create paths for themselves far earlier than any of us were able to do. So part of the planning process is remaining open to what he tells us. It’s a power dynamic shift because as a parent you feel obligated to guide them. But this new economy, this new world where these kids come out of the womb digitally savvy and have the world at their fingertips requires more of a partnership where, by the time they’re in fifth grade or seventh grade, they’re pretty able to tell you like here’s what I plan to do. I’m already working on it. I’m learning it right now. I speak Mandarin and I understand the world very differently. So that’s exciting for us to see. Yes, obviously we’ll set aside money in case the traditional route is still the thing that he wants to pursue and still exists, but we’re also remaining open to the idea that in 15 years, the options are very different for him.

Jeff Ptak: One topic we’ve asked a number of our guests to weigh in on is what works in financial education and also what doesn’t work. You two are financial educators. What works and what doesn’t if you’re trying to help people improve their decision-making about money matters?

Julien Saunders: I love that question, first of all. Thank you for asking it. I don’t know that I think of myself as a financial educator. And I also don’t want to be disrespectful to certified financial educators out there. I know for sure people learn from us. But when I do think about our skillsets, it’s really that we are storytellers, we are marketers. We’re speakers if anything. And from that standpoint what I’ve found works is storytelling. I’ve learned it the hard way, not to lead with lecture and not to lead with data points because it’s actually not been very effective. What is effective is when you can tell people a story. Something that they can relate to. And that to me has been one of the most impactful things that we could ever do. When we think about what the future holds for the work that we do now, and we think about what success looks like, we really pay much more attention to people like LeVar Burton. And you think about the impact that he had on literacy rates with Reading Rainbow, or you think about Neil deGrasse Tyson and you think about his ability to draw people into wanting to care about science, who wouldn’t normally be interested in that subject.

And what I found is actually really, really impactful isn’t just the storytelling, but it’s to be entertaining. Americans value entertainment. We spend disproportionately on entertainment. And so, if you can find a way to entertain people while weaving in financial lessons, I think that’s one of the most important and impactful things that you can do. Even this podcast, I mean respectfully, this has been one of the best conversations, we’ve had, but I know far more people who would be more willing to watch a basketball game than listen to me speak about money.

The question or the creative challenge for us becomes, well, how do we figure out creative ways to continue to make this fun? How do we not make it feel like they’re learning? It’s a matter of just meeting people where they are. We’re addicted to entertainment and so it’s really a matter of saying well, if you want to have an impact on the masses, you’ve got to figure out and understand mass media. But then you also need to figure out how do we entertain people because that’s where the attention is.

Christine Benz: A related question is how much financial education we should be teaching kids in schools? There’s been a lively discussion on financial Twitter about whether that should be a part of every grade school, high school curriculum. Can you give us your thoughts on that question, like how much financial education should we be getting in schools and how do we find time for that, alongside other important things, to be teaching kids?

Kiersten Saunders: I love this question. I used to be a volunteer with an organization called Junior Achievement that focuses on readying kids with financial literacy and business literacy early. So, I’m a proponent for introducing these topics to them as early as possible. And the reality is money is already discussed in school. It’s just usually discussed in the context of not having enough of it. We’ve all, if you are a parent, we’ve all participated in fundraisers and bake sales and popcorn buys and gift wrap, whatever it is. Like these kids know that money needs to be exchanged for things to happen. But I think the context of how that then shows up in real life is the part that’s missing. And I think this is where companies can really be innovative, especially companies that are local to a school system or a school site to come in and help create scenarios where kids can learn not behind a desk and a lecture style, but through the act of participating in some sort of staged economy.

With Junior Achievement, they have a building called BizTown where all of the corporate entities in Atlanta came together and we created a storefront, and the kids get fake money and it’s basically a field trip. They get to go for like three hours, they get a budget, they have to go to the grocery store, they got to go to the bank, and they learn what $300 actually buys. It sounds like a ton to a 5-year-old until you’re faced with, well now you’ve got a phone bill, you wanted this car, you wanted groceries. And it helps them contextualize how far money gets them. I don’t know that we should add another thing to teachers’ plates, bless their hearts. I love educators. They have a lot on their plates, and many of them, again, do teach about money. But I do think this is where corporate entities and small businesses and communities can really pitch in and help schools teach more about financial and business literacy.

Jeff Ptak: What kind of lessons are you trying to impart to your son about money and financial wellness?

Julien Saunders: My first lesson was actually forced on me and I don’t know why I didn’t see it coming. But there’s a place called Andretti’s down here in Atlanta where we live and it’s like your typical arcade, kids games, and that sort of thing as you play the games, you win tickets. And if you’re a parent, you know where this story is going. You collect all your tickets and you’re supposed to cash in those tickets for toys. And our son’s eyes lit up because he saw that big shiny blue car and he was like oh man. So, he’s got a hand full of tickets, more tickets than he’s ever seen in his life. And that’s really how he learned his first lesson on the importance of saving. I then failed miserably at trying to teach him that you don’t have enough son. I know you have 100 tickets, but you actually need around 10,000 tickets to get the big shiny blue car. And the first time it did not go so well. But I was so pleased the second time we went. We didn’t even get in line, and he was only five, but he knew then. And he was like nope, I’m going to wait, I’m going wait. And granted, he did not wait until we ended up getting 10,000 tickets. But he did wait long enough to get some silly helicopter.

Kiersten Saunders: Something other than like a Smartie.

Julien Saunders: And that was more than just another piece of slime that ended up in the garbage can. It’s little things like that, like just reinforcing what it looks like to work hard, to earn tickets, or money, and if you want to go there and get the reward for something bigger is there if you’re willing to be diligent and patient. It’s really the simple things now. And we’re also very fortunate that our faces are on the cover of our book. He sees that, and he’s asking questions about what does that mean? What does that stand for? It makes it a lot easier to lean into some of these early financial conversations.

Christine Benz: You mentioned the arcade. And so, I wanted to ask about this influx of new investors into the market. It seems like we get a lot of new investors who are dabbling in individual stocks, crypto. It sounds like you think that that’s probably not the right approach to start with some of those more speculative investments. It sounds like you two think that people should start with a broad base of investments through index funds, for example, and only add to the riskier investments after that. Can you discuss kind of how you think about investing, how you think most people should approach it?

Julien Saunders: In a former life I was a professional chef and so I tend to use a lot of food analogies and I think when I think about cryptocurrency specifically I think people should just think about it the same way they think about hot sauce. Like you just need a couple of shakes, if any, but you don’t need to smother. It’s certainly not and shouldn’t be like the main protein or the main part of your dish. If you want to leave it off altogether, then more power to you, but if you’re going to put it on there, you only need a couple of shakes. It doesn’t need to smother your entire portfolio, or certainly doesn’t need to be the primary focus of your meal if you will.

Jeff Ptak: Your podcast covers a lot of different topics, from ESG investing to food insecurity to buying used versus new. How do you decide what to talk about each week?

Kiersten Saunders: That’s a good question. Our podcast when we created it, we wanted to really explore this intersection of life and money. And we wanted to think about all the places because our listeners, your listeners, people who are already engaged in the financial community and content are well aware that you’re supposed to spend less than you make, invest along the way. There’s only two or three golden rules and so we really wanted to explore and get under the hood of like all right, well then what stops people? And so, we started picking all of these areas, these moments of conflict or tension, where people know the right thing to do but just don’t do it, whether it’s because they’re hungry. That’s what the food insecurity episode is about. Like when you’re hungry, the idea of putting money away for 10 years sounds ridiculous.

When you are supporting a parent, the idea of not having a ton of cash on hand sounds ridiculous. So, we just start to explore all the big and little ways that people can find themselves, ignoring all of this good financial advice. And we’re very fortunate that we still, although our business is digital, we still have a very active in real-life lifestyle. Every week we are talking to parents and members of the community, our friends, our family, and so we pick up a lot of the ideas just from general conversations people will just say stuff. And we’re like, wait, what? Say that one more time. Why did you do that? It becomes a topic and then it grew on its own. People now write us notes and ask us to discuss things like they’ll say, “Can you explain the metaverse really quick? I don’t understand why this is such big news.” And so, we’ll do it that way. But it’s not something that like we batch hundreds of episodes at a time. We get ahead, but we don’t try to get so far ahead that the topic that we’re talking about isn’t relevant to the audience in the moment.

Christine Benz: As you reflect on some of the podcasts and videos you’ve done so far, what are some of the ones that you’re proudest of.

Julien Saunders: I think without question. We have a video series that we do called “Money on the Table,” where again we focus on being entertaining and we cook a meal or go to a restaurant and have an engaging conversation about money while enjoying that meal. And I think the most impactful one for sure would have to be when we invited my mom over for dinner because we learned a lot about her history, her growing up in Jamaica. And the reason why we did that episode is because we know so many of our listeners—and we alluded to it earlier in this conversation—so many of our listeners, and many millions of Americans really, are struggling with financially supporting their parents. And the goal of that conversation was to one, learn a little bit more about my mom, and then to confront that obligation head-on to get her understanding, what her expectations of our support was going to be. Try to help her understand why it’s actually really challenging, not because we don’t love her, but it’s really one of the more difficult parts about managing money for us, especially at the time where our business was still pretty young. We weren’t really sure what we were doing. It was really interesting and impactful because it serves as a springboard for other people to have that very uncomfortable conversation with their own parents.

And we hear from viewers and listeners all the time, and they say, “Man, I sent that video to my mom, and it actually helped me to have that conversation with her because she saw herself in your mom.” And people’s hearts were racing as they are watching this video. Because it is kind of tense, but it’s real and I think it’s one of the more difficult parts of managing money, which again sits at the heart of why we do the work that we do. We believe our listeners are some of the smartest people out there. They don’t struggle with financial illiteracy; they struggle with the social and the cultural issues that get in the way of them making smart financial decisions. And in an effort to be role models and to fulfill the mission of our business, which is just to inspire better conversations about money, we figured there was no better way to do that than to simply show them what it looks like.

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Ptak: Our guest on the podcast today is Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at Morningstar. In her role she works to integrate the findings of her research into Morningstar financial management applications and tools. Before joining Morningstar in 2015, Sarah earned her doctorate in Behavioral Economics from the University of Maine, where her work focused on the psychological barriers to sound personal money management. She's the author of Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind. Sarah also holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Salem State University, a master's degree in Financial Economics from the University of Maine, and a master's certification in Personal Financial Planning from Bentley University.

Sarah, welcome to The Long View.

Sarah Newcomb: Thank you. It's great to be here.

Ptak: So maybe we'll start off with financial literacy, which I know is a key area of interest for you. You've noted that rules of thumb really work in financial education. What are some examples? And why are they so useful in your opinion?

Newcomb: I love rules of thumb. I think for the most part, we need to work with the way our brains work rather than against them. And we tend to take the complex and distill it down to the very simple, and so rules of thumb work with the way that our brains like to work.

One of my favorite examples of studies in the rules-of-thumb area was an experiment that was done with small business owners in, I believe it’s, Central America. And what they did was they split them into two groups, and one group was given a basic accounting course. And the second group was given just a bunch of rules of thumb for accounting. And then the next year, guess which group performed better on their accounting tasks? It was the rules of thumb group. And part of the reason is because rules of thumb are memorable, and they're general and flexible. And we can often take them into more than one circumstance. Where we learn exact equations, those equations only are fitting in very specific circumstances. And so, rules of thumb tend to be more general, more flexible, more memorable, and therefore they're more useful. So, I think that for most financial decisions, yes, there are some where exactitude is important, but most financial decisions can be solved with general rules of thumb as long as you're applying the right rule to the right circumstance.

Benz: What are some examples in personal finance where a rule of thumb might be useful?

Newcomb: I think some really simple ones are things that probably most people will be very familiar with: things like keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 30% so that you can get good interest rates and have your debt be manageable, and not overwhelming. Things like saving at least 10%. Putting general rules around the amounts that you're putting toward the past and the future, I think are really helpful. Things like, I mean, there's a typical ""100 minus your age"" for equity investment rule of thumb, which I think a lot of financial advisors balk at, but it's at least a starting point. It's at least a place to say, look, this is better than throwing a dart at the board. And lots of times what rules of thumb can do is get us started thinking about a problem and at least get us moving forward.

So, I think rules of thumb can be especially helpful in situations where there's a lot of information that's complex, and maybe not enough time to really digest all the information. Heuristics and rules of thumb are what our brains use to make good enough decisions, when we have constraints on our time, or the amount of information we have available to us or the amount of information we can process. And they're really applicable when you're in a situation where there's too much information or not enough time, or both. So especially when it comes to things like looking at comparing funds and comparing lots of complex attributes of different investment strategies to put into your portfolio.

A lot of times one of the things I love about Morningstar's work is our star ratings, our moat ratings, our globe ratings, our carbon leaf ratings--these are all rules of thumb. They take the very complex financial analysis and fundamental analysis of the company's balance sheet and business practices and distills them down to something that's digestible, memorable and useful. And so I think that those ratings are great rules of thumb to be able to say look in the absence of being able to understand every single bit of information and read all the prospectus on everything, you can say I'd like a fund that has five stars and a wide moat and five globes. And you're going to make a good enough decision in that situation. And we often focus on trying to make absolutely the optimal decision, when really what we need is to be able to make a good enough decision and be happy with that.

Ptak: That's a good segue to the next question we had, which is the financial-services industry and its tendency to try to optimize portfolios and financial decision-making, which is laudable in a way, but do you think it's gotten in the way of some of these rules of thumb taking hold? We're often surprised, for instance, about the amount of criticism that good quality target-date funds come in for among financial-services professionals, for example. So, do you think that the financial-services industry allows perfect to be the enemy of good, with good being some of those rules of thumb that you mentioned?

Newcomb: I really do. And I understand it as well. I'm a math person. I love numbers, I love the problem-solving, the puzzle aspect of trying to come up with an optimized investment strategy. And I know that because this involves math, a lot of us that are numbers-oriented want to be able to find that perfect solution. But there's a psychological reason why this optimization is actually not a great approach. And there's been some really interesting research into these different attitudes toward selection. And one of them is called maximizing, the ""maximizing mindset"" and the other one is called ""satisficing."" And what research has shown is that maximizing is all about trying to find the optimal choice, selecting the optimal choice for you. And we can do this in every domain of life from finding the perfect investment vehicle, or the perfect mate, the perfect restaurant, whatever it is, we try to optimize and maximize our well-being, maximize the utility that we're getting from something. Maximizing is looking for the best.

Satisficing is a totally different approach that sets sort of a standard, a bar above which, as long as the option that you're looking at meets or exceeds this particular standard that you set, you will be satisfied with the outcome. And what research has shown repeatedly is that people with a maximizing mindset often make an objectively better decision than the satisficers do. So, they do end up choosing the better option in the end. But when they're measured on satisfaction, on confidence in their choice, and on measures of things like depression, and overall well-being as related to the choice, maximizers are less happy with their choice than satisficers, even though they've objectively made a better choice. And part of the theory here is that what happens with a maximizing mindset is that you get so fixated on finding the perfect thing that you're never satisfied. Whereas if you have a satisficing mindset, the challenge is to set your standard of satisfaction high enough that you truly will be satisfied. And then beyond that, you stop searching for a better alternative.

So, I think to put this in a little bit more concrete terms, let's say you speculate on a company you think is really poised for growth, and you invest in that company. And it returns 400% return in the first year. Are you satisfied with a 400% return, or are you concerned with well, how high can it go? And a maximizing mindset won't be able to sell a winner, because you're fixated on getting the absolute most return you could possibly get. And so, you get fixated on timing the top. Where a satisficing mindset says, look a 400% return is a great return on my money. I'm going to take that and find another bargain somewhere.

Benz: I know that you're super-interested in the topic of financial education and helping people learn about investing in personal finance. I wanted to ask what you think about the stock market game that a lot of schools use to teach students about investing? Do you think that's productive? Or should they be doing something else to help kids get information and help them get engaged?

Newcomb: I have a lot of mixed feelings here. I know the people that run the stock market game, and I think that they are--it's a laudable effort, and I think there are some pros and some cons to it. The pros are that it definitely gets kids interested, and it makes the stock market feel accessible and fun to them. That's great. The cons are that when you think about it, the way the stock market game works is it's generally a one-yearlong competition and whoever gets the highest return wins. And so, what you're teaching them to do is to chase short-term returns. Because the team that wins is most likely--the best strategy for short-term returns is speculation, not long-term investment. You want to speculate and buy penny stocks and hope that you get a 5,000% return in that year. And you don't learn the benefits of long-term fundamental analysis when you are focused on chasing one-year returns.

It's difficult, though, to come up with a really strong alternative that's engaging enough, because with a 30-year timeline, the long-term investment takes a long time to see the payout. And it tends to be very boring in comparison. And I think the challenge for teaching kids or teaching anyone really about the stock market is to contract that 30-year timeline into something short-term so that you can get that adrenaline rush of the payoff without having to wait 30 years for it. But I think that the stock market game and getting kids involved in any kind of investment competition, where the metric of success is returns, and the time frame is short-term, you're setting them up to speculate, not to invest.

Ptak: So maybe to build on your answer there. How do you think do-it-yourself investors can balance their urge to dabble in individual stocks with the need to invest in a way that gets them to their goals? And how can advisors help their clients scratch that itch to pick stocks, while doing what's best for them? Is it reasonable, you think, to maintain sort of that separate ""mad money"" account?

Newcomb: I think it's a great question. Because the thing is that speculation is fun and legal and can be really lucrative. And it's one thing that really gets people involved in the stock market, is the idea that their money can grow quickly. So, I'm definitely pro speculation, I think speculation is great, so long as you play. The thing is that speculation and investment are two different games. And there's a different set of rules for each game. So, you need to know which game you're playing, and you need to do it responsibly. So long-term investment is slow and steady and fairly boring. And it's not going to give you that adrenaline rush. And many of us who like to see returns and who are impatient and want to see our money grow quickly, are more drawn to picking individual stocks, trying to find that way to get an edge on the market.

And I think having a separate mad money account, that's a reasonable percentage of your portfolio where you can afford to lose that money completely, and you're not going to be kicked off your trajectory toward long-term solvency then I think it's great. And if you make a lot of money speculating, then you've got more money to speculate with. But if you lose it, you're not losing sleep over it. And I think that having that percentage, having your fun money, I call it my gambling fund, it's a separate investment account that I've got set up for picking individual stocks. And it's great because I can scratch that itch. And I can get involved in investing in the things that I think are really exciting. But I'm never worried that I'm putting my financial future at risk by doing that. And if you're speculating with too large a portion of your assets, then you're going to be far more sensitive to the volatility of the stock market, because you're not as well diversified. I do think that it's great to let people play, but let them play with a responsible amount of money so that they're not sabotaging their long-term outcomes for short-term adrenaline.

Benz: Going back to the topic of financial education, we had Professor John Lynch on the podcast a while back, and he asserted that a lot of financial education doesn't stick and contribute to better outcomes because it decays over time, like a lot of education that we receive along the way. Does that jibe with your observation and what do we do with that? How do we change up what we're doing with financial education to address potential decay?

Newcomb: What I think Professor Lynch was referring to are the studies that show the memory decay of concepts after participating in certain financial literacy courses. And I've seen that research, too. And the thing about a lot of mathematical knowledge is like this; a lot of knowledge is sort of ""use it or lose it."" You can learn a topic, but if you're not actually putting it into practice, we don't remember facts unless they're repeated and repeated and repeated. And so, if you're not using it, then you're going to lose that knowledge. And the sort of use-it-or-lose-it nature of these topics make it very, very difficult to create really effective financial literacy programs.

I don't agree that financial literacy doesn't work, and I don't think that John was trying to say that it doesn't work as a blanket statement. But I do think that we have to pay attention to the teaching approaches and making sure that the ways that we are trying to communicate this information, let's use the knowledge that we have about what does work, and what we're seeing is sticking. And I think we've seen a lot of evidence that just-in-time financial education is really a lot more people are receptive to learning when there is something in their life, there is a financial decision that they're trying to make. For example, if you learn about a lot of different types of mortgages and interest-rate structures in high school, you may or may not remember that when you go to buy a house, depending on how interesting and engaged you were when you took the course. But when you're about to finance the largest, probably the largest purchase you've ever made, you're a lot more open to learning about the ins and outs of different mortgage products.

And so just-in-time financial education takes advantage of the emotional and psychological engagement of the moment and provides just the information that's needed at the right time to be able to then be put into practice right then. So that you do use it, and you're less likely to lose it, because you have put it into practice.

Ptak: As we've been talking about, it's hard not to be compelled by the just-in-time concept, but the question is how realistic it is to insert financial education into point-of-purchase decisions? 401(k) plans are maybe a best-case scenario where the employee generally wants, or I should say the employer generally wants what's best for the employee, but there's no such good actor in many other financial decision-making situations. So, can you think of practical ways that more just-in-time education can happen if it is feasible in some of those scenarios?

Newcomb: That's a really good point. And I think embedded in your question is the reality that we have this interesting situation where the financial services and advice industry is regulated under the caveat emptor framework, which is buyer beware. And so, the onus is on the customer to understand the products that they're buying. And how this sort of dovetails with just-in-time financial education is that people may not understand the math, or the pros and cons, or the different attributes, that are involved in the product-selection process when they're about to, say buy either a security or sign a loan product. In fact, a lot of people don't even think about these things as financial products. It's only in the finance industry that we use that term ""financial product."" Most people, most of the customers, aren't thinking about products like they're on a shelf and they can compare them by attribute.

What happens is that when people are ripe for learning about a particular financial decision, they will go and seek out information because the onus is on them to understand the products that they buy and the decisions that they make. And who's right there, really eager to give them all the information that they could want, so long as it's bent in their own version of things, is the sellers of those products. And so sometimes we end up with a situation where you have people who are very vulnerable to marketing and to misinformation, being the target of explanations, or basically marketing pitches that seem like they're financial education. So, there'll be workshops that try to teach you about retirement that really are trying to sell you a product. And because they do have some education embedded in them, they can be useful to some extent. But the customer is sort of an easy target for manipulation, because they don't know what they don't know.

And I do think that there are some ways we can get around this, I think that there are already some great solutions out there, some fintech firms that are trying to use things like alerts to monitoring transactions, monitoring things like your credit score. Credit Karma for instance, if they see a change in your credit score, they'll alert you to it. That's a great time to educate people about how to improve their credit score, or what kind of loan products they might qualify for, etc. So, in that case you're using the alert about a change in the person's either balance sheet or credit information to trigger that just-in-time moment for education. But even Credit Karma is trying to sell you credit cards or loan opportunities. You have to question whether the incentives are truly aligned.

I think that we could really, there's an opportunity here for better alignment between the people who have access to really holistic financial data about people, namely banks, who have all their transaction and balance information, and nonprofit financial literacy organizations. If we had some better alignment there, then maybe some of the people who are out there trying to teach sound financial literacy could have more of that, could find those moments through the banks being able to send an alert to someone if there is some behavioral or transactional data that alerts them to a critical moment that might be happening in a person's financial life. Could then surface the appropriate information and financial literacy information that they could use at that moment.

Again, even the banks tend to be commercial. So, we have an issue where there's often a misalignment between the interests of the seller and the interests of the buyer. And there's a huge asymmetry of information. And yet the onus of responsibility is on the buyer, who doesn't know what they don't know. I do think it's a big problem. I also think every problem is an opportunity. And there are ways that I think fintech can come in and be smart about what information they present to who and how. But I do think it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of commercial for-profit institutions that have that data, partnering with people who are trying to get the knowledge into the hands of the people that need it.

Benz: We want to switch over to discuss financial wellness and all that that encompasses. You've been working on a project that aims to help people quickly size up key metrics of their financial health. How are you aiming to get beyond the usual metrics like net worth statements when it comes to gauging financial wellness?

Newcomb: This project has been really a labor of love over the last year for me. I've been trying to figure out a good way to do personal financial statement analysis, much in the way that we look at financial statements of companies and look at things like their price/earnings ratio. I've been asking the question, ""What are some key ratios and statistics that we can glean from our personal balance sheets in order to find out how healthy our own financial management is?"" And I have some training in personal financial planning and went back to some of that information, the kinds of things that financial planners are trained in.

And generally what we do is we create a balance sheet and a cash flow statement and try to create something like a net worth goal over time, but I think there's so much more that we can look at to help us understand not just where we stand right now, but the trajectory of our wealth, the potential longevity of our wealth, measures of short- and long-term solvency. Some of the things that help us understand not just where we are, but how resilient we may be to shocks and losses. And putting these things into really simple metrics that are easy to calculate and easy to understand. So that we can set short- and long-term goals and track these things quickly over time.

And so, this has been a big project for me. And I've been thinking about it a lot, and most common is this net worth metric, but net worth is pretty meaningless on its own, I mean, what's $1 million? Well, if you spend $40,000 a year, then $1 million is a 25-to-1 ratio, which represents under pretty simple assumptions of inflation and growth expectations. A 25-to-1 ratio pretty much represents, you can retire, you're going to be financially independent, you're not going to outlive your money. But if you spend $200,000 a year, then that's only a 5-to-1 wealth-to-spend ratio, and that's only going to last you six or seven years under the same assumptions.

And so, being able to contextualize net worth into this ratio of wealth to spending is a really simple way to set a goal and say, look, I'm looking for a 15-to-1 ratio by the time I'm 60. Some people have already blown past that 20-to-1 ratio. And if you look at it that way, you might be able to say, well, if I have a 25-to-1 ratio, my wealth will last me 35 years on my current spending, just putting it into context. So that's one thing that I think is really helpful. Another one is looking at the trajectory of your balance sheet. And this is also fairly easy to calculate. What you do is you add up all the interest that you're paying on your debt--not the amount that you're paying down on your debt, just the interest that you're paying, just the money you're paying to own that debt in the first place. And you subtract that from the amount you expect your assets to grow over the next year.

Let's say you've got $100,000, growing at about 7% in a retirement account, so then you're looking at about $7,000 in interest on that account, in a year's time. But if you're paying $10,000 in interest on your debt, then you've actually got a $3,000 drag on your balance sheet because of the way that you've set up your accounts. And this concept of a base growth rate is another really simple statistic that you can calculate to find out before you add to your asset accounts. And before you pay down your debt, if you're just looking at the amount that your assets are earning in the accounts that they're currently in, invested as they are currently invested, and just the amount that you're spending on interest. Then, if you have a negative base growth rate, that's an immediate red flag that your debt needs attention. And so, before you go and invest more, you should probably either refinance some debt, or move some assets to pay down that debt, or somehow get that base growth rate to positive before you even start to add more to your assets and pay down your debt.

It's a way of finding out, is your balance sheet in balance? If you do nothing, is it going to grow, or shrink? And I think it's a really great way to look at that underlying health of your balance sheet. And it's two very simple numbers to calculate. And you subtract one from the other and you've got this very illuminating statistic. So those are the kinds of things that I've been scouring the Earth for, to try to find the things that we can use to illuminate our personal finance, so that we can see where we're at, see where we're going, and set some goals and track. If we track these simple metrics over time, we'll make better decisions than we would just by looking at our net worth.

Ptak: One challenge for everyone in the financial planning and investment space is getting people to prioritize the future. Are you compelled by research that shows getting people to empathize with their future selves works, for example, by showing them images of what they might look like later in life? Are there any tools that you could recommend in this vein?

Newcomb: Yes, so I have done a lot of research in this area and been inspired by some great academic researchers in this area, Hal Hershfield, Gabriel Edington, and some others. What I've seen in my own research is an extremely strong connection between how far into the future people tend to think and plan, and how much they have saved or acquired in assets. And when you think about it, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you want to be investing for the long term, you need to be able to think long-term. But we're not all naturally long-term thinkers. Some people are blessed with that as a trait, and they are naturally thinking 10, 20 years ahead, and those people are going to tend to be better planners and better savers than people like me who naturally think just a very short period of time ahead. And if you're only thinking a month into the future, what happens is that your discount rate--this has been connected in many studies, that people who are short-term thinkers have a higher discount rate--we have higher levels of present bias, which means that we are less likely to actually feel that we discount the cost. If we get the benefit today, then we overvalue the benefit in our mind's eye compared to the cost down the line, which we shrink in our mental estimation.

And when you do that mental cost-benefit analysis, the benefit of a small amount of money today feels a lot more than the benefit of a large amount of money in the future. Because the future is so far off in our mind's eye, that it's like a landscape painting, we shrink everything down. And we see it as small in comparison to this up-close benefit that we're getting right now. And that effect, we all have that effect in our brains to some extent. But people who are short-term thinkers, it's more pronounced, we have a higher discount rate. And for people who are naturally short-term thinkers, training our mind to think further ahead, training our brains to think further ahead and to see into the long view, can be an extremely valuable habit of mind to cultivate.

Now, naturally, long-term thinkers don't need to do this, because they're probably already doing it. But this is especially useful for people who are short-term thinkers. And most of the research that's been done in this space has been done on college students who are young, and the research shows that your mental time horizon does elongate naturally with age. We tend to think further ahead as we get older. But the problem is that by the time we're naturally thinking about retirement age, sometimes for those of us that weren't thinking far ahead in the future, it takes us too long. We're already in our late 30s or 40s by the time we're concerned about retirement, and at that point, it may be too late to catch up. And training your mind to think further ahead as soon as possible is an extremely efficient use of resources, because it doesn't cost anything. It's very simple and it's very effective. But, how to do it?

There have been some tools that were developed to do this. Hal Hershfield teamed up with Merrill Lynch a few years back, and they created, it was Merrill Edge, they created this thing called “Face Retirement,” where you would take a photo on your webcam, and it would age-progress it. And it was cute, and it showed you some stats about retirement and I don't know if it's still up or not. I don't know how effective it was. The graphics were definitely in the uncanny valley where it was a little bit creepy to look at this future version of yourself staring back at you. But it can be very effective, because what it's doing is, it's shrinking that psychological distance in your mind's eye and it's making the future seem more real, more detailed, and therefore, our brains translate it as more likely. And so those of us who are not naturally inclined to think in the long term, interventions like age-progressing your face can help sort of jump-drive that or jump-start your imagination to seeing the long term.

But you don't really need tools. All you need is to think a little bit further ahead than you normally do. If you're normally planning about a year out, then maybe think about five years out. And what you want to do is really infuse your picture of your life in that time period with as many concrete details as possible. Because what happens when we think about the future, the further something is out in our mind's eye, in time, the more we will see it, we paint with a broad brush. So when we think about things that are close up, we see the details, we think about the concrete things, the things we have to do, the how of what we're doing, when we think about something that's far off, because we know that there's uncertainty involved, we paint with a really broad brush. And we see things sort of abstract. A lot of people think about retirement and they think, oh, yeah, I just want to relax in retirement.

Well, what's far more useful is to go way beyond saying I want to relax in retirement and to get really specific. Think about a day in your life. Where do you want to be living? Is it in a house, a condo, is it in the country, is it in the city? What are you going to be doing with your time? How will you fill a typical day? And really think through it. Financial advisors have been taught to do this with clients since the beginning of the profession. What science is doing now is sort of filling in the, Why does this work? And the reason why it works, the reason why infusing your picture of the future you and your future life with concrete details helps you to be more long-term oriented, is because it helps shrink the psychological distance between the known today and this far-off future that feels very abstract and unknown. And the better you can see it, the more likely you are to plan for it, because the more emotionally engaged you'll be with it, and the more your brain sees it as a reality. So short-term thinkers have got to learn how to think about the long term in great detail. Long-term thinkers are probably already doing it, so just keep it up.

Benz: You wrote a piece entitled, ""Is Instagram Making You Poor?"" for Psychology Today, a few years ago. So how do social media and comparing ourselves to others work against our ability to save for the future and even think about the future?

Newcomb: Social comparisons is a big topic. We all know that keeping up with the Joneses is a huge resource suck on many people. But it can be difficult not to do it because we're social creatures. Social comparison theory states basically that we all need to know sort of where we stand. We want to know, how are we doing at this life thing? And when we don't have an objective measure by which to judge ourselves or our progress, what we do is we look around us for a similar other to compare ourselves with. And this is such a natural inclination that we don't even notice ourselves doing it. And when we compare ourselves to others, I wanted to know how social comparisons were affecting people's bottom line. And so, I did a number of surveys, asking people about who they compare themselves with, how often, whether they're comparing themselves with people they think are higher on the socioeconomic ladder or lower. And then I asked a series of questions about their financial well-being. So specifically, I was asking them about their emotional experiences with money, how often they felt joy, peace, satisfaction, and pride, versus how often they were feeling anger, stress, helplessness, and anxiety with respect to their money.

What I found in analyzing the results of this was that first of all, most people are comparing themselves financially--no big surprise there. And in every income group, most people are comparing themselves with those that they believe are better off. Not everyone, but more than half of the people in every income group are looking up the socioeconomic ladder when they compare themselves. And then I looked at the correlation between that upward comparison versus downward comparison and the emotional experience with money. And it was no big surprise to me to find that the people who were comparing themselves with those they thought were doing better, were experiencing more stress, lower satisfaction, and not only that--they were spending more and saving less, because they were trying to reach that higher level or live the lifestyle that they were looking at and admiring.

We end up with a situation where this need to compare ourselves may actually be driving us to lower financial health, because the people that we tend to compare ourselves with are doing better, and so the natural comparison makes us feel bad. And in order to deal with that psychological pain, some people spend in order to try to achieve the lifestyle that they're admiring of the person higher up the ladder. There was, however, in this research, a very interesting finding, which was that who people compare themselves with made a big difference in one particular category. There was this one little group of people that said, they compare themselves not to their friends or families or neighbors or celebrities, or even themselves at a previous time in life. All of those people who were making those comparisons, which was the vast majority followed this pattern, where if they looked up, they felt bad; if they looked down, they felt great. And most of them were looking up and therefore feeling bad.

This one little group compared themselves with a financial role model--specifically a financial role model. And they, regardless of whether they were looking up or down the socioeconomic ladder at that role model, they were feeling consistently more financial satisfaction, regardless of their income level and regardless of which way they were looking up the ladder, up or down the ladder.

And it really, I think, illustrates the difference between what I would call evaluative comparison, which asks the question, “Do I measure up right now?” And aspirational comparison, which asks the question, “Can I follow in their footsteps and be where they are in the future?” Which you may have noticed is a future-oriented question. And so, it also ties into that long-term view. But when we look up the socioeconomic ladder and compare ourselves with people that we think are doing better, we may think we're being aspirational in doing so. But if the question you're asking yourself is, “Do I measure up?” And you're looking up the ladder, of course, the answer is no. You don't measure up because you're choosing a target that's doing better than you are, at least you think they are--you can't see their debt.

But those that choose a financial role model, don't ask that question, “Do I measure up now?” They're looking at someone who, who has made decisions that they want to emulate, and they're asking, “What can I do to be more like them? How can I follow in their footsteps?” Then you can say no, “I don't measure up now, but that's OK, because I can do what they've done.” And that's the difference between aspirational, true aspirational comparison, which can be very healthy and adaptive and motivating, and evaluative comparison, which is maladaptive and unhealthy and demotivating.

Ptak: Let's shift and talk about the pandemic. Some consumers were able to use the pandemic period as an opportunity to repair their household balance sheets. American savings rates soared, especially in the early part of the pandemic. The question is, how can those consumers hold on to those healthy habits, even as the economy has opened back up, and there are more spending opportunities? What do you think?

Newcomb: I was so happy to see that finally Americans were saving, but it took a crisis. And I think there's a couple things we have to try to remember, in order to hold on to this new habit of saving. First of all, remember how scary it is to realize you don't have solvency--the state of people's emergency funds in this country are atrocious. We all have probably been exposed to one stat or another that you know that the majority, or at least 40% of Americans, couldn't come up with $400 at a moment's notice without borrowing it from someone or going into debt or putting it on credit. That is a very alarming statistic, because what that means is that we walked into this pandemic largely insolvent. Many, many, many households don't even have short-term solvency and you can't even think about long-term solvency without short-term solvency.

When people are afraid, they save, and then when they're not afraid anymore, they spend. And I'm all for consumer confidence, I think that's great. I'm not anti-spending. But I do think that we have to first of all remember how scary it is to not have solvency, remember how scary it was, if you were one of those people that decided you absolutely needed to start saving, and you wished you had been doing it all along. Try to remember that feeling, because you don't want to be there again, and you don't have to be there again. Then on the other hand, really holding on to that feeling of how good it feels, to have a bit of solvency, to have some slack, to have some security. I generally don't talk about emergency fund in those terms--I think of it in terms of months of safety. How long could you go on your liquid assets, if you lost your income today, just with the money that you could get your hands on in a week or less with no penalties? How long could you maintain your current lifestyle before you'd have to make changes? That's your safety net. It tells you how much freedom you have to be able to handle a shock, or to rebuild after a shock, or to make a major transition.

And I think that what the pandemic really exposed for many people was a basic need for solvency. And I hope that we will really emotionally remember how it feels to be insolvent, and then start to really appreciate how good it feels to be solvent. Because those of us who are not saving enough--which you know, listeners to this podcast probably are great savers--but maybe you know someone who's not a very good saver. Generally, it's because saving doesn't feel as good as spending. We do things that feel good to us, we do cost-benefit analysis all the time. And if what you choose is to spend, then that's because spending won out in your mental cost-benefit analysis. The emotional, the nonfinancial benefits outweighed the financial costs. And your overall utility of spending in your mind's eye was greater.

So, in order to keep this habit of saving, we have to love saving, we have to like the feeling of having money more than the feeling of spending money. I think really leaning into that--many people don't, they feel like it makes them greedy, or somehow we have all these negative connotations around money and greed in our society. And the idea of really sort of savoring that feeling of having money can feel very strange and even bad to some people, especially those who haven't had money. And I think just really leaning into the feeling of security and stability and peace of mind that having money brings, to help you to counter the temptation to go and get the short-term payoff of that new thing that you want. I'm all for spending so long as you maintain that solvency that allows you to sleep at night, and to think long-term and to bounce back when there's another shock, because there will be one.

Benz: What inning would you say we're in, in terms of behavioral science and psychology permeating the investing and finance areas?

Newcomb: I think I would say maybe the fourth or fifth inning. We've gone through periods of establishing the models of behavioral economics as both psychologically and empirically valid. We've gotten the message out that these models of decision-making work and are often more accurate than our rational choice models. And the field has gained notoriety, the academic journals have expanded, and there's more respect for the field both in academia and in the private sector. I think that there's a widespread knowledge now of behavioral science as a field of some of the major models and concepts of behavioral science. So, we've sort of permeated the landscape of finance, but I think that we still have a long way to go in terms of maturing as a field and specifically coming up with proven solutions.

Behavioral science has a lot to say about how we deviate from rational decisions, has a lot to say about how we make maybe imperfect decisions, or how we can get in our own way financially. But we have very few proven methods for solving these things. These are difficult problems to solve, because the work required in order to create proven solutions, it involves field tests in the wild of actual financial interventions and psychological interventions. And a lot of people are--it's very hard to get access to the kind of data that is necessary to perform these studies, because a lot of people don't want their financial information to be exposed to researchers, people are loath to be experimented on, they don't want to be part of the trial, they want only the proven solution. And so a lot of the companies that have the data that the researchers need in order to create these randomized control trials that will allow us to create proven solutions, there's a lot of barriers to getting that data into the hands of researchers, to getting the types of interventions that might help to be tried and validated.

Some of that work is being done. But it would go a lot faster if there was more of an appetite for trying new things. It's just difficult. It's difficult, in the intervention space, in the solution space. We've got a lot of things that maybe work in the lab with volunteers and college students, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it works in real life with all the other types of noise around us in decision-making. I think that we still have a long way to go to mature, and to be able to provide real solutions beyond just explaining the problem to people.

Benz: Behavioral finance researchers like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler have become celebrities in the financial industry over the past couple of decades. Are there any researchers whose work you feel is underappreciated relative to its importance?

Newcomb: I do. Yes, I think I have got to shout out to Gerd Gigerenzer. He is a contemporary of Thaler and Kahneman and Cass Sunstein. And his work, he's got a great book that is about, it's about smart shortcuts is what I call them. And I did a series a couple years back on Morningstar about simple shortcuts that make us smart. What Gigerenzer, the point that he's trying to make and the bit that he's bringing, the angle that he's bringing to the academic and public discourse on the topic of behavioral finance, is that heuristics are actually in many cases, adaptive strategies for making good-enough decisions under the constraints of time and information that we have to deal with. And heuristics are our beautiful brain's wonderful way of being able to make really good decisions when we don't have enough time to process all the information, or we don't have enough information to really assess the problem. We can still make a good-enough decision with some smart heuristics.

The issue is that when we misuse heuristics--and heuristics are rules of thumb, they're the simplifications that our minds create in order to make fast decisions under uncertainty and time constraints. And so, heuristics can be very adaptive, they can be very beneficial, but they can be maladaptive in two specific cases. First of all, when taken to an extreme, they can, anything taken to an extreme can be maladaptive, but heuristics either used in the wrong situation, or taken to an extreme can lead to biases, and biases are really the things that are the enemy of good choices, not heuristics themselves. So Gigerenzer I think deserves a lot more notoriety and should be getting a lot more play in the media because he's really, I think, illuminating how we can work with heuristics to make really great choices. Instead of trying to turn ourselves into robots by figuring out all the ways that we're irrational and then trying to be more rational. I think it's much easier to work with our brains rather than against them.

Ptak: There's been a lot of interest in the investments and financial-services industry, in customization, for example, services that allow investors to customize a portfolio based on their preferences, which can include ESG preferences or their tax circumstances. Can you discuss what you see as the pros and cons of that kind of customization from your standpoint? It seems an investor might be more likely to stick with a customized portfolio, but are investors in a good position to understand the trade-offs of some of the choices they're making, for instance, by removing all the energy exposure from their portfolio?

Newcomb: I'm generally pro customization, I think it's great to be able to align the portfolio with the person. But again, I want to go back to this idea of the maximizing versus satisficing mindset. Where if you're so focused on getting the perfect portfolio for you, you might end up really in a situation where you're paralyzed and can't pick one. I think that customization to an extent is great but understanding the limits that if we go too far down the bespoke portfolio rabbit hole, you can end up with trying to overfit the portfolio to the person.

And, our preferences are not necessarily stable. What we want is, is for our portfolios to match the things that we care about deeply, the things that, the goals that we want to achieve. And yes, someone may be more likely to stick with a highly customized portfolio. But I think what really it comes down to is that we're a lot more likely to stick with an investment strategy that we understand. Because then when moments of uncertainty and volatility happen, we can look at the investment strategy that we've chosen. And if we understand it, if a client can explain the overall strategy of their investment portfolio, in their own words, not your words, but their own words, then they truly understand it. And when they understand it, their confidence in it is going to increase and when their confidence in it is higher, then they're more likely to stick with it.

It's not so much that they want it to match them perfectly. It's that they need to understand it and believe in the strategy so that when things get rough, and they will, they can hold tight to that strategy. If someone doesn't fully understand the strategy, then when they start losing money, they're going to doubt the validity of that strategy. And I think that transparency, financial education, teaching people why you're investing, why their strategy is right for them--that's where the magic really happens. So much of the financial advice industry seems to be relying on trying to blind clients with all this knowledge and techno speak. And we obfuscate where we should be simplifying. What really is valuable to people when it comes to a financial plan or an investment strategy is the confidence that they know that they've made good decisions.

And so that comes from understanding, not from just trusting someone to be smarter than them. That doesn't help them stay in when things get hard. What helps is if they themselves really understand. So, I think that it's interesting, because I feel like I'm in an industry that loves to use big words and complex equations, and I'm here saying we need to think about feelings, and we need to simplify everything. But I think it's really true. We make so much out of the math and we forget that, our lives do not revolve around our investments. It's the other way around. And, if people can trust that they've made sound--that their investment portfolio was made on sound principles that they understand, then they're going to be able to stay with it when it gets tough.

Robby Greengold: Over the 10-year period ending September 2019, more than two of every three actively managed large-value funds failed to beat the total returns of the Russell 1000 Value Index. Mid-value funds fared even worse, with nearly nine out of 10 lagging their Morningstar Category index. Across the board, relative results for value funds have been disheartening for proponents of active management. The fierce competition for alpha begs the question, What flavors of value investing are out there, and what are the ingredients for success? Among value investors who take a fundamentals-based, bottom-up approach, a few distinct philosophies stand out. Some value investors focus on finding bargains, which they shop for through the lens of intrinsic valuation--they ask themselves, ""what's the worth of this company's assets today, on a per-share basis, and how does that compare to its stock price?""

The managers at Gold-rated AMG Yacktman are reliably valuation-conscious, which sometimes leads to hefty cash stakes when the team can't find cheap stocks to buy. Contrarian value investors look for stocks that are out-of-favor--companies that the market has punished for one misstep or another but that offer a better fundamental outlook than the market appreciates. The managers of Invesco Comstock, a Silver-rated large-value fund, often go against the grain. They conduct rigorous analysis of a company's financial statements and growth drivers, in addition to macro, industry, and idiosyncratic factors, all in order to gauge a stock's upside potential and downside risk. Weathering the storm of a controversial bet can take time to pay off, but the managers are patient as their investment theses play out. Other value investors prioritize quality over discounts. For example, Silver-rated MFS Value aims to emphasize companies with competitive advantages, solid balance sheets, and relatively high margins. That focus has contributed to the fund's historical resilience over the long run. For almost any fund that picks stocks using fundamental analysis, success relies heavily on the strength and stability of the team involved. Does the team stand out for its ability to construct a benchmark-beating portfolio that responsibly manages risk? For the three value-oriented funds we've discussed here, the answer is a resounding ""yes.""

Michael Hodel: For most of 2019, we've been recommending AT&T shares as the most attractive in the U.S. telecom industry, sporting a generous yield in addition to trading at a significant discount to our $37 fair value estimate. However, over the last several months, AT&T shares have rallied strongly, especially after Elliott Management started to take an interest in the company and push for changes in the management team and the corporate strategy.

With this stock now trading at a little bit of a premium to our fair value estimate, we don't see a ton in the U.S. telecom industry that's particularly attractive for dividend-seeking investors. Right now, if we were to pick one stock in the sector, we would look at Comcast. While Comcast shares don't yield as much as AT&T or even Verizon, they still yield about 2%. And importantly, the company doesn't pay out nearly as high a percentage of its free cash flow as AT&T or Verizon do. Comcast pays out about half as much as those two companies, roughly 25% to 30% of its free cash flow, and that gives the firm a lot more room to grow its dividend over time. So, while AT&T and Verizon have been growing their dividends about 2% annually, Comcast most recently raised its dividend 10%. And we think that dividend growth is set to continue over the next several years as Comcast digests the Sky acquisition, continues to repay debt, and continues to shift its focus more towards the dividend and away from share repurchases. And Comcast, we expect, will eventually return to share repurchases once it gets its leverage down to a more comfortable range. But we do think that that dividend will make up a more important portion of the firm's total capital return over time.

And with regard to the balance sheet, Comcast and AT&T have similar leverage. So, Comcast after the Sky acquisition has about 3 times debt to EBITDA, which is a little bit higher than where AT&T is at, at about 2.7 times, but AT&T also has its pension obligations that aren't factored into that metric. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, the balance sheets between Comcast and AT&T are roughly comparable. And so, we think Comcast has equal if not a little bit better credit profile than AT&T does.

So, Comcast isn't a compelling bargain today. It trades right in line with our $45 fair value estimate. But relative to AT&T and Verizon, which again are trading at premiums to our fair value estimates, we view Comcast as somewhat more attractive today.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar. Many retirees are terrified of running out of money in retirement, but they need to balance that worry against a competing consideration: underspending and not enjoying their retirements to the fullest. Joining me to share some thoughts on how retirees can strike the right balance is Joel Dickson. He's Vanguard's global head of advice methodology.

Joel, thank you so much for being here.

Joel Dickson: Great being here, Christine. Thank you.

Benz: Joel, when I heard we were sitting down, I wanted to discuss something with you that came up when you taped our podcast, our Morningstar podcast. And we were discussing this whole thing about retirement plans, sustainability, and people like you and me think a lot about how can we make sure this person doesn't run out of money. But you raised a really provocative point, which is that it's a big deal if someone way underspends during their spending horizon. So, let's talk about why you think that issue is under discussed.

Dickson: I do think there's been so much focus on the worry about not having enough resources during your accumulation years to then be able to meet a retirement approach, a retirement spending approach. And a lot of times, it's like, the headlines about people aren't ready for retirement, they're not going to be able to spend how they want, maintain their standard of living. And in many ways, I think that's overblown. Not to mean it isn't important! People need to think about, you know, what do I need for retirement. But where I look at it is that we have kind of the standard assumptions for how we define success and whether you will have sufficient resources to meet your retirement needs. And I think it's really important to look and understand what those assumptions are. And a big one in retirement is, the standard approach in advising around success and retirement: retire at age 65, plan for a 30 year or more retirement.

Benz: Right.

Dickson: And success is basically,do I run out of money by the time of the end of that planning horizon? So, for 100% of people, we are using a planning horizon of let's say, age 95 or age 100 to which less than 5% of people will probably actually survive--at least under current mortality assumptions. So that 5% case is extraordinarily, in some ways, conservative. Now, there will be people that make that…

Benz: Right.

Dickson: …that far and we need to worry about.

Benz: Right. Plus, there's a real connection with wealth and longevity, right?

Dickson: There is.

Benz: So, people watching us probably, I'm guessing have portfolios, they are wealthier individuals, they may be a little closer toward that 30 year time horizon.

Dickson: Yes, very much so, but at the same time, even to the extent let's even say it's 10% of people that make it that long. In many ways, you're going to have not so much of retirement savings crisis, but a retirement spending piece of, there's going to be money left over. Not a bad thing necessarily, but you know, it's more of, could you have enjoyed that during your lifetime, in a different way? And I think it gets back to working with your advisor or talking with yourself, your partner, and so forth about what does success look like in retirement? What is it that I want to accomplish and achieve? Because what I call the ""bounce my check at the funeral"" approach, which is, hey, do I run out of money by the time I'm age 95 or 100? And I'm just going to spend to that piece, right? Actually, it doesn't reflect how people have generally, at least how we've seen people spend money in retirement.

Benz: OK, so have that discussion about whether a bequest is a big deal to you. If it's not, then you may want to spend a little more actively from the portfolio, or how should you approach that?

Dickson: I think especially in the early years of retirement, those are the years that most people can enjoy the spending. There's often another part of the assumption in the whole planning process of, I have this 85% number of my final income, that I'm trying to target. And it's going to grow with inflation. You know, in terms of what I'm spending in retirement. What we see in terms of actual spending, all those things like healthcare spending, tends to increase over the retirement period. Overall spending tends to decline in inflation-adjusted terms. So, what we end up seeing is actually--and in part, my 80-year old parents are very much in this situation right now--it's not that they don't necessarily want to spend, but they don't really have the ability to spend on things, like they just can't go on trips in the same way they did or come visit the grandchildren in the same way that they did. And so those types of physical, mental limitations and so forth as we get older. One question is whether that spending can be shifted a little bit early. So maybe you spend a little bit more in early retirement years when you may be more able to do that, recognizing that your spending will probably adjust automatically or you may adjust it based on resources as well later in retirement.

Benz: Right. So one other complicating factor--and we could talk about this all day--if the market is not so great in your early retirement years, when you were hoping to really do a lot of your spending, that can be a problem, especially if you are needing to spend from an equity portfolio that's declining.

Dickson: Yeah. It's interesting because, this whole sequence of returns question, which is that point: Does it matter when the returns of the market happen in terms of your own retirement journey? I actually still see that as a longevity question not so much as a market question, which is that sequence of return only matters if you live a long time. If you only end up living to 85, then the sequence of returns if you have otherwise been said to be sufficient to age 95 or 100, the fact that you live to 85, probably that sequence of returns isn't as important. So, it's ultimately a longevity thing. And can you think about ways to protect against that longevity risk while still spending from your portfolio in a way that just doesn't say, I'm going to forgo spending now because I'm worried about potentially running out of money later.

And that's why things like, think about, we talk in a kind of a Vanguard global retirement framework standpoint, about different buckets of money--not buckets in the ways the same way, Christine, that you talk about it for investing. But in terms of things like your basic level of income or discretionary income or spending. We kind of bucket that all together when we talk about, oh, you have an 85% chance of not outliving your resources. But probably what most people want is 100% chance or as close as possible to being able to meet the basic everyday living expenses. Yeah, I've got some sort of roof over my head, I've got the food, I've got my basic medical needs taken care of.

Benz: Don't have to move in with the kids.

Dickson: Exactly. It's the ""don't be a burden,"" sort of, ""I don't want to be a burden to someone else"" piece. If the discretionary pieces now, on top of that, it's like, well, yeah, OK, I'd love to do it. But if I can't, I'm still not being a burden. That piece of it I think, thinking about it from that standpoint and focusing on what's the basic level of income that I really need to insure against, and that's being the first piece. And that may be covered by Social Security, it may be covered by you having defined-benefit income, you might even early in your years work part-time. There are any number of ways.

Benz: Use an annuity perhaps in that context.

Dickson: Use an annuity, exactly. Potentially also long-term care insurance in retirement to, I guess, again, managing some downside risks, although that market is complex and probably needs some guidance...

Benz: Right.

Dickson: ...In looking at that. But there are a number of things that, if we focus on what's the kind of basic level of income, that then frees up, kind of the flexibility in the discussion for other sources of income and how you then think about enjoying that, and maybe you can even then front-load some of that early in the retirement years.

Benz: OK, Joel, great insights. Always great to hear your perspective. Thank you so much for being here.

Dickson: Thank you, Christine.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.

Charles Gross: Narrow-moat Sherwin-Williams is among the largest producers of architectural and industrial paint in the world. We assign a $340 per share fair value, well below the prevailing market price of $590. With shares trading well into 1-star territory, we strongly recommend clients avoid purchasing shares, or divest their current holdings.

The market price currently bakes in two key assumptions that we disagree with. The first is that Sherwin-Williams will gain unrealistic amounts of market share over the coming decade. The second is that the company will achieve record-breaking adjusted EBITDA margins and sustain them over the economic cycle. Both outcomes appear highly unlikely to play out.

Digging into the first argument--Sherwin-Williams grows its share of the coatings market by opening new stores. Over the last two decades, the company has been able to grow its footprint by about 2% to 2.5% annually. In order for us to generate a fair value comparable with the current market price, we have to assume that the company can accelerate that opening pace to 3.5% per year--more than 200 new stores each year--into an increasingly saturated market for paint. The constraints that will prevent the company from reaching those expectations come down to labor constraints and only so many attractive new storefront locations. Management has already noted how challenging it is to maintain current growth rates of new store growth, let alone opening twice as many stores going forward.

On margins, today's market price implies substantial profit gains on both the retail and industrial side of Sherwin's business. On the retail side, Sherwin would need to achieve and maintain EBITDA margins of 27%--that's not only well above the best-ever performance Sherwin has generated, but it's well above the best performance we've seen in the entire industry over the last 20 years. On the industrial side of the business, the company would need to maintain EBITDA margins consistent with the highest levels seen across the industry since 1999 indefinitely. We think neither outcome is realistic.

We think future energy or pigment price shocks will be enough to shake Sherwin's share price back to earth. About half of each can of paint is linked to energy prices. Even though paint companies are often thought of as industrial businesses, their margins are clearly correlated with changing input prices. The company benefited significantly from the energy price collapse in 2014 and 2015, which we think is part of why investors are so optimistic about future margin levels. Even in the absence of an input price shock, we think competition over market share will be enough to prevent record-high margins from lasting indefinitely.

Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski. Morningstar director of personal finance Christine Benz just put the finishing touches on the content of our annual Portfolio Makeover Week. Christine is here to share some of the key lessons from the week that we can all learn from.

Christine, thanks for joining us today.

Christine Benz: Susan, it's my pleasure.

Dziubinski: Now your first lesson is for people to think about getting help planning for their retirement. Do we all need financial advisors?

Benz: Well, possibly. One thing I would say is when I looked through the submissions, and we got a lot this year, many of them were from people who were just getting ready to retire. So, they're trying to figure out, do I have enough? If when I embark upon retirement, I'm looking at my portfolio, how much can I withdraw from it each year? Really hard questions. And I do think that because retirement decumulation is inherently more complicated than accumulating assets for retirement, it is a good spot to stop and get some help.

What I would say though, Susan, is that not everyone needs ongoing portfolio handholding. So don't assume that if you have an advisor who you're using to help with your retirement plan that you necessarily need to sign on for an ongoing engagement. You might just get maybe a one-time check on your plan, and then maybe checks every couple of years, as you go along. You might not need that ongoing handholding. So, I leave it to each of our viewers to decide how much help they need. But it's definitely helpful, especially at this life stage to seek out the help of a tax-savvy financial advisor.

Dziubinski: Now, you noticed that a number of people who had submitted portfolios said that they were planning to delay their retirement, which--there's nothing wrong with that. But you suggest that people have a backup plan. Why is that?

Benz: Well, I love to hear that. And I will say, for example, one of the couples who I profiled, he was 80, she was 70. They had really enjoyed working, they work together actually, and they were just now getting fully retired. So, we're seeing this more and more I think in our lives, too. And there's a lot to be said from the standpoint of finances when it comes to delaying retirement. The thing I come back to, though, is what Mark Miller says, Morningstar contributor Mark Miller says, which is that delaying retirement is a worthy aspiration, but it's not a plan.

And to sort of accentuate that fact, I would point to some research from our colleague David Blanchett, who's Morningstar Investment Management's head of Retirement Research. And David's research has shown that people oftentimes don't retire at the point in their lives when they expected to. So oftentimes, people who expected to delay are forced to retire earlier than they expected. It might be their own health considerations. It might be spouse’s or parents’ health considerations. It might be that they were maybe forced out of that higher-paying job sooner than they expected to. So, I think it's always worthwhile to lay a backup plan. If your plan is to extend out your working years, put in place a plan for what you would do in case you couldn't keep working.

Dziubinski: Now, Portfolio Makeover Week is usually about, sort of the investments in the portfolio. But you can't deny the importance of Social Security and sort of the equation of retirees. So, can you talk a little bit about how impactful delaying Social Security can be, and what you found with the makeovers.

Benz: It's huge. And so, you know, we'll run through sort of various scenarios using portfolios with different asset allocations, and different withdrawal rates, and changes that we can make at the portfolio level. But some of the changes that you can make with Social Security delay date, if you're willing to extend that a little bit can be just so much more impactful. So, an example I would give from the Portfolio Makeover Week is that one of the people was a 60-year-old woman, and she was sort of toying with retiring at full retirement age claiming Social Security benefits at what Social Security calls her full retirement age. So, like 67 versus waiting all the way until age 70. And what she found was that the differential was like between $2,500 a month and $3,200 a month, so a $700 a month differential for delaying. And it's just impossible to make that kind of gain in a portfolio value with changes.

Dziubinski: With some tweaks.

Benz: Right, right. So, it's just one of the biggest-ticket changes that you can make to a plan. The thing I would say is that delaying Social Security doesn't necessarily mean delaying retirement. So, it may be that someone retires, pulls from their say, Traditional IRA assets first, and then delays Social Security and is able to claim that benefit later. So, there are a lot of moving parts here. But it doesn't necessarily mean that delaying Social Security means a later retirement date, part-time work can also figure into the mix.

Dziubinski: Now, it always pays to be sober about market return expectations. But you noted in the in the makeovers that that's especially true for pre-retirees and retirees. Why is it so important for that cohort?

Benz: Well, because that the first say 10 years of retirement is a really important time in retirement, and you want to make sure that you're not drawing too much from your portfolio, or expecting too much from your portfolio during those early years. So, when I was plugging in return assumptions for people who are getting ready to retire, I was using very muted return expectations, in part because of the current market environment that we're in. So, we have very low bond yields, currently. We have not-cheap equity valuations, although I've been singing that same song for a couple of years now, and things really haven't changed, things have continued to be really quite good. But nonetheless, I think it is probably just prudent when you're thinking about the next 10 years to be mindful that market returns might not be that great. You definitely don't want to extrapolate from the past 10 years for the next 10, because we rarely see things work out that way.

What I would say, though, Susan, for folks who have longer time horizons who aren't so concerned about near-term retirement, but maybe they're planning to retire in 50 years or 40 years, or something like that, well there I say if you have an equity-heavy portfolio, go ahead and use long-term market return assumptions, maybe 8% or so for the equity market. Because I do think over long periods of time, it's the best we have to go on. And you probably don't want to give your return expectation that much of a haircut if you have a really long time horizon.

Dziubinski: And speaking of people, investors who have longer time horizons, you had a few makeovers this past week that focused on older folks who are either entering retirement or nearing retirement, but you did have a couple of younger portfolio makeovers this year. And for those, there's an emphasis on remembering to balance the short term and the long term. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Benz: Yeah, it's really interesting to me. One was a younger individual not yet married, the other was married couple, three young children. And so what really struck me in looking at their plans was, yes, they needed to prioritize retirement funding because they can take advantage of compounding, all those things we hear about, the advantage of getting started early on your retirement fund. But they were also balancing here-and-now considerations and in both of their cases, what I saw is, in my view, they're pretty underfunded in terms of their emergency fund. So, I think a little multitasking is in order. Both were trying to purchase homes in fairly high, expensive property markets. So that was another challenge.

So, one thing that I would say is kind of a tip for people who are trying to balance the long term and the short term, is to think about using a Roth IRA for part of the plan. And one reason that I have always talked about the Roth IRA being such a nice multitasking vehicle, is that you can withdraw your contributions at any time and for any reason without taxes or penalty. So even if your intention is to leave the money to grow until retirement, if you need to get at it sooner, you can get in there without many strings attached. So, I think that's a nice vehicle to consider maybe in addition to taxable accounts that you might have for emergency fund needs.

Dziubinski: Great. Well, Christine, thank you for sharing these lessons today and thank you for the makeovers this week.

Benz: Thank you, Susan.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com. Morningstar's director of manager research, Russ Kinnel, is a long-time observer and researcher of mutual funds. He's here with me today to share some of the holdings in his own portfolio.

Russ, thank you so much for being here.

Russ Kinnel: Glad to be here.

Benz: Russ, I feel a little like I am getting a look at what's in Bobby Flay's cupboard or something like that. It's great that you are willing to share some of your own personal portfolio holdings. Before we get into them I'd like to talk about what qualities generally speaking you look for when selecting mutual funds.

Kinnel: I look for low cost, great management, great strategy, ideally something that can be a core holding for a long time in my portfolio. Really a lot of the things we look for in a Gold-rated fund are what I look for. To be a top holding in my portfolio naturally has to be something you can really depend on, something I really have a high opinion of.

Benz: Where do you come down on the passively managed versus actively managed question when it comes to your own portfolio?

Kinnel: I think they are both great. I have mostly active funds in my portfolio, but I do have some passive as we'll discuss. I think they are both great. We have Gold-rated funds from both categories. I think most people should probably own some of each, I think it just makes a lot of sense--each can do a good job and it also depends, how much effort you want to put into the research obviously. Active requires a little more effort than the passive.

Benz: Good point. Before we get into some of your specific holdings, for each of them I am hoping you can say where you hold them--whether you hold them in 401(k), IRA, taxable account, or so forth. Let's start with American Funds New World. Talk about where you hold it and then I'd like to get into why you like it.

Kinnel: I have got this one in my 401(k), it's in Morningstar's 401(k). I just like the fact that it's a nice conservative emerging-markets fund. We have institutional share class of the fund, so very low cost, very dependable fund.

Benz: For people who aren't familiar with this particular fund. It's really different from most other pure emerging-markets equity funds. Let's talk about that and how it's construction sets it apart and makes it more conservative.

Kinnel: That's right. It's got some of your typical emerging-markets equities. But it also has some in developed market equities from businesses that do a lot of business in emerging markets. It's kind of taking a more holistic approach to that, and what that means is that it's less volatile, but it also means you are giving up a little. When emerging markets really rally this fund's going to lag. I think it makes a lot of sense, that there are a lot of different ways to get that exposure. To me, it makes a lot of sense, but it's not going to be the highest potential returner in the EM space.

Benz: Right. So, in a year like 2017 when EM is going strong this fund will perhaps tend to not perform quite as well.

Kinnel: That's right, but I think its useful for investors because these more cautious EM funds are the kind that people will hold through the downturn, because when emerging markets get hit they get hit really hard. You lose 50% or 60% of your investment. If you can minimize that loss or reduce it a bit that's going to help people stick through to the good side.

Benz: Really good point. Let's look at another international fund, this is Dodge & Cox International Stock. Let's talk about where you own it first and why you own it.

Kinnel: Sure. I have got this one actually in my 401(k) and in a taxable account. I initially brought in a taxable account before it was available in our 401(k), later added it to our 401(k), so I own it in both places.

Benz: In terms of it's appeal it lands in our foreign large blend category it's a Gold-rated fund. Really time-tested process on display in this fund.

Kinnel: Dodge & Cox is an old school value investing firm. But to me maybe the most important thing is just the stability of people, that their analysts and managers tend to make a career of it there. You've got team-managed approach here, and so one person, retiring doesn't throw off the fund in the least. Really a great group of analysts and managers there. When I talk about a fund you can own and forget about, Dodge & Cox is really almost like an index fund in that you can buy their funds and they are pretty much going to be the same fund in five or 10 years.

Now this one does obviously have some risks. It got burned in '08, it had too much in financials, but I really believe in the fund, obviously, I owned it before that time and I held through. So, I am a true believer.

Benz: Dodge & Cox funds are really low cost.

Kinnel: Very low cost. Again, we talk about active versus passive, and I think whether you are active or passive, you want low costs. When you have a low-cost active fund like this one, they only have a small hurdle to catch up with a passive fund.

Benz: Now, let's look at another fund that you hold. This is Vanguard Primecap Core. Let's talk about where you hold it and why you like it. By the way, this is one I own, too.

Kinnel: This one is closed to new investors. I hold it in a taxable account. There are Primecap Odyssey funds that are still open, so you can get pretty similar fund. But low cost, the best growth investors out there. I just really believe in them. You have a team approach here where each manager picks stocks separately from the other managers, but they all have the same input of their analysts. They are just very good fundamental growth investors. You put that together with Vanguard, and its really low cost. This one I have in a taxable account. I have Vanguard Capital Opportunity in an IRA, and I have Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth in a 401(k). So, I am a big fan.

Benz: It is one of the firms, when we ask our analysts, what's your highest conviction active shop, Primecap usually bubbles close to the top.

Kinnel: They are outstanding.

Benz: Let's talk about the last fund, also a Vanguard fund, this is Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation. Based on its name, I'm assuming you hold it in a taxable account, you better.

Kinnel: Good guess.

Benz: Let's talk about that. I think that these tax-managed funds, you and I both like them, but they are kind of under-recognized among investors, especially as many investors have gravitated toward ETFs for tax efficiency. Tax-managed funds, though, are still worth a look.

Kinnel: Yeah, they are. Jack Bogle once joked about the words ""tax managed"" being the best way to scare investors away, and it seems to continue to work. You put ""tax"" in the name and people think it's boring, you are sacrificing returns. It's really just essentially the Russell 1000 with a couple of tilts. One, they tilted slightly away from dividend payers, because dividends sometimes get taxed more than capital appreciation. The other thing is they actively harvest losses in order to offset gains. The upshot is on an aftertax basis you should do really well, and in fact it has done really well. It's actually beaten the Russell 1000, the S&P 500 on a pretax basis. I don't know that I would necessarily that going forward. That may just be a little bit of luck. But the more important thing is on a aftertax basis, this fund should continue to deliver. It really is good at avoiding capital gains distributions.

Benz: It gives you very broad diversification almost indexlike exposure but with a little bit more tightness around the tax efficiency.

Kinnel: That's right, and it's super cheap and of course when these funds came out there were not many ETFs out there. Now it's maybe less of a standalone draw compared with ETFs because now there is lots of ETFs with good tax advantages. But it still keeps on chugging, it's really low cost, and it does a great job.

Benz: The other thing that I like about it is that it can adjust to the tax regime. If tax laws change, and as you suggested dividends could be at some point taxable as ordinary income again, the fund would be able to adjust its strategy a little bit.

Kinnel: That's right. Because it's not actually an index fund, it's passive more or less, it does have some flexibility to adjust that. It is nice because the tax laws change every few years.

Benz: Russ, thank you so much for giving us a peek into your own portfolio, really helpful.

Kinnel: You are welcome.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com.

Heineken is the only truly global premium lager brand, and we see the firm as well-positioned to exploit the long-term trend of consumers demanding higher-quality alcoholic beverages.

At 8% global market share by volume, Heineken is a distant second behind Anheuser-Busch InBev, which controls more than one fourth of the market. But those volume figures don't tell the whole story. Heineken's consumers have higher incomes than drinkers of mainstream beer categories, where AB InBev dominates.

Demand for premium beer is also less subject to cyclical macroeconomic forces, and consumers are somewhat less price-sensitive. As a result, brand loyalty is a more significant source of economic moat for Heineken than it is for the other leading brewers.

Heineken's narrow economic moat is also supported by its cost advantage over smaller competitors. Heineken is the number-one or -two brewer in the majority of its large geographies and is the global leader in cider. This market leadership gives the firm a cost advantage, since brewing is a capital-intensive process that requires large investments in plant and equipment.

We expect Heineken's competitive positioning to strengthen over time and for the company to deliver long-term improvements to returns on capital. We therefore assign the firm a positive moat trend rating.

Our fair value estimate for Heineken's ADRs is $52 and shares are fairly valued today. At a wider margin of safety, though, Heineken is a solid investment opportunity.

***

Jaime Katz: Narrow moat Tractor Supply continues to trade a compelling discount to our $84 fair value, in 4-star territory. The company released solid first-quarter results despite a spring that has yet to arrive across many of its geographies, capitalizing on an increasingly nimble supply chain to keep cold-weather gear in the network where appropriate. Moreover, this implies that spring sales remain postponed in many areas, potentially leading to a warm-weather season that is compressed into the second quarter and comps that could be around 3%, similar to first-quarter comp store sales of 3.7%. The first quarter was the third sequential quarter of same-store sales growth above 3%, a key level where Tractor Supply can leverage expenses, although we caution investors that the rest of the year is forecast to deliver comps below this quarter's metric.

While some of the categories that Tractor Supply operates in are relatively mature, we view the breadth of its offerings and potential for growth of its current consumer base, as well as increased penetration of new consumers, as positive factors that could drive top-line growth. We project that total sales can grow at 7% over the next five years supported by low-single-digit comparable-store sales and mid-single-digit square footage growth. On the cost side, our assumptions incorporate modest margin expansion of about 20 basis points annually on average after 2018 leading to an operating margin of 9.4% in 2021. Besides lower costs attributable to opening new distribution and third-party logistics facilities ahead, Tractor Supply should be able to tactically allocate its advertising spend, drawing on information from the 7.6 million members in the Neighbor's Club loyalty program the company launched nationally just one year ago.

For investors seeking exposure to the consumer discretionary industry, we think Tractor Supply remains one of the best-positioned brick-and-mortar retailers in operation, thanks to its differentiated product mix, loyal customer base, and defensibility against e-commerce competitors, thanks to the high weight/value proposition of their products.

***

Billy Fitzsimmons: We recently re-evaluated our entire cybersecurity coverage list. And in doing so, we took a fresh look at Palo Alto Networks. We still maintained the no-moat rating, but we upgraded the trend to positive from stable. Overall, we think there's two major trends affecting cybersecurity vendors like Palo Alto Networks. First, complexity and second, consolidation.

It used to be that network security vendors were creating firewall services whether physical or virtual. Today, the vectors of attack for enterprises is becoming much more complex. You have firewall, you have SaaS, you have endpoint security, cloud security. They are making the enterprise security efforts much more byzantine. You need multiple solutions to protect yourself from all those vectors.

Second is consolidation. It used to be that a point vendor would sell you the services for endpoint which would be separate from firewall. Now we're seeing consolidation where one vendor like Palo Alto can do all those things together. We think that's increasing the switching costs for a company like Palo Alto Networks. We have solid uptick in new products such as WildFire, sandboxing operation, and we are also seeing growth in nascent products such as VM-Series and Aperture, which are poised to grow.

We think overall instead of just selling the next-generation firewall, which is Palo Alto's bread and butter, customers are going to increasingly buy subscription offerings from them, which is going to keep growing average revenue per user, which has been ticking upward the past five years. We think this is poised to continue and as enterprises purchase more and more solutions from Palo Alto Networks, it engrains Palo Alto's services inside the IT infrastructure of its client base, growing switching costs.

Now, having said that, our $182 fair value estimate places Palo Alto Networks in fairly valued territory. For investors looking to get into this space, we'd recommend a look at Check Point Software Technologies, which we believe is trading at a discount. It's poised to grow at a slower rate than Palo Alto, but we like the firm's 50% operating margins, $4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and strong management team that we think is poised to continue to buying back shares over the ensuing years.

Jeremy Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. It's graduation season, and many people might think a check to the new grad is the best gift. Christine Benz, our director of personal finance, thinks that there's some more nuance there and some other choices that you have.

Christine, thanks for joining me.

Christine Benz: Jeremy, great to be here.

Glaser: You think that when thinking about gift giving to new grads, you really do have to consider their life stage and that cash may not always be the best choice?

Benz: That's right. For people exiting high school, oftentimes college is on their radar, so some sort of dedicated college savings vehicle might make sense. If it's someone who is exiting college, maybe they have higher education or further education on their radar, maybe additional savings for that educational expense makes sense. For people who are exiting college and beginning new jobs, you may have some other investment types that you want to help contribute to on their behalf.

Glaser: Looking at high school grads, or someone who has grad school on their future, are 529s really the best vehicle?

Benz: Well, certainly, when it comes to the tax benefits, 529s are hard to beat. As long as the money stays within the confines of the 529 plan, assets can be invested and grow without any tax burden. Then when you pull the money out for college expenses, for qualified college expenses, those withdrawals will also be tax-free. Another key advantage is that if you contribute to your home state's 529 plan or whatever plan you contribute to offers tax deductions or credits, that also burnishes the appeal of 529 plans from a tax standpoint.

Glaser: One downside though can be how it impacts your financial aid?

Benz: That's right. It does depend mainly on your relationship to the student. If you are a parent, the 529 assets tend not to be particularly punitive from the standpoint of that FAFSA form, that financial aid form. But if you are a nonparent, say, you are a grandparent or an uncle who wants to contribute to educational expenses, those assets will tend to affect the child's financial aid eligibility if they are spent prior to the child's final year of college. That's one reason why college funding experts say, if you are a nonparent, advise the parents to hang on to those assets until that last year of school, so it won't affect financial aid eligibility.

Glaser: Writing a check or giving cash also is going to impact financial aid too?

Benz: Well, it could. Large cash gifts to a student will potentially affect their financial aid eligibility; so will saving for the student within the confines of a UGMA/UTMA account, because those assets are technically the property of the child. That tends to look the worst from the standpoint of the financial aid applications. The other thing to know about the UGMA/UTMA accounts is that those assets become the property of the child when he or she reaches the age of majority. The child does not bound to use those assets for college funding. If that's your goal, you may want to get the money inside some sort of college savings wrapper.

Glaser: Let's talk about investing in these 529 plans. Sometimes the time horizon is quite short. For a high school student, it could just be a couple of years. What's the right asset mix that's going to make sense?

Benz: It's a really good question. Certainly, if you have a time horizon of, say, shorter than five years, you should not be in stocks with that component of the 529 plan. You'd want to focus on high-quality bonds, ideally short-term bonds, perhaps even cash investments for very near-term expenditures. Some 529 plans have stable-value funds. Those can be a nice option that offer you a little bit higher yield than cash, perhaps a little bit more risk, but not much more so. That's another vehicle type to investigate.

Glaser: Turning to the grad who doesn't have school in their future again, what are some of the options there that could get them off on the right foot?

Benz: There are a couple of things to think about. One is, if the student has some sort of student loan that he or she is exiting college with, perhaps you can lend a helping hand in terms of paying down that debt. The typical student exits college with about $30,000 in college expenses or in college loans. Many students have much more than that. If you can help burn through some of that debt, I think that that's a really gracious, terrific thing to do.

Another idea is, if you have someone in your life who is just exiting college, maybe getting an apartment, getting that first lob, maybe you can just give a baseline of cash and counsel about the virtue of having that emerging cushion. Say, this is not money that I intend for you to use to take great trips or buy a car. This is money that you are going to use to hold as an emergency fund to help defray any unanticipated costs. You can do a little bit educating along the way.

Finally, for young people who are exiting college and who have landed jobs, one other idea is to consider contributing to a Roth IRA on his or her behalf. The big advantage is that that young person can take advantage of his or her very long runway to grow those assets for retirement. Of course, there are really valuable tax benefits that accompany a Roth IRA. The other thing I like about the Roth IRA as kind of starter savings vehicles is that it can multitask for emergency fund needs and for long-term retirement funding. If you pull your contributions out of a Roth IRA, there will be no taxes or penalties, which makes it a nice, kind of, retirement savings vehicles with training wheels for people who are trying serve multiple goals.

Glaser: The question I know you get a lot is about the gift tax and people being worried about the gift tax. You think a lot of these worries are overblown?

Benz: I do. If you contribute or if you give more than $15,000 to a single individual in a single year, so in 2018, you will have to file a form to accompany your tax return. But unless your total lifetime gifts combined with your estate after your death exceed $11 million, you will not be subject to actual gift tax. You won't have to pay extra taxes for having been generous during your lifetime. I do think that sometimes people hear about that gift tax form and think that it necessarily entails paying extra tax; in most cases, it doesn't.

Glaser: Christine, thanks for your gift giving tips today.

Benz: Thank you, Jeremy.

Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. Thanks for watching.

Disney shares were modestly lower this morning despite the firm turning in better than expected quarterly results. With the stock trading in the 4-star range, we believe current prices offer an attractive entry point for investors.

While management did not discuss the potential for a spoiler bid from Comcast for either the Fox assets or Sky, CEO Bob Iger reiterated the importance of the assets and the firm's desire to buy both the Fox media assets and Sky.

Overall revenue for the quarter increased 9% year over year to $14.5 billion. The studio segment continues to outperform as Black Panther has grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has already exceeded $1.2 billion in global box office without opening in China.

Andrew Lane: Within the Morningstar equity research department, we keep a close eye on the performance of the Wide Moat Focus Index, a collection of the cheapest U.S. wide-moat-rated stocks under our coverage. Typically, the strategy holds 40 to 50 stocks, with the reconstitution and rebalancing process taking place four times per year. The index is important to us as its construction represents the cross section of our differentiated economic moat methodology and our rigorous bottom-up valuation work.

In the first quarter of 2018, the strategy underperformed its Morningstar U.S. market benchmark by 1.6 percentage points. This represents a pause from the strong momentum established over the last two years. In 2017, the Wide Moat Focus Index outperformed its benchmark by 2.3 percentage points and in 2016 the strategy outperformed its benchmark by 10 percentage points.

In the first quarter, index performance benefited from a positive allocation effect, driven primarily by an overweight position in the consumer cyclical sector. However, unfavorable stock selection more than offset sector positioning tailwinds. From a stock selection standpoint, the index saw impressive first-quarter performance from technology holdings but disappointing performance from healthcare and consumer cyclical stocks. Veeva Systems, Amazon, and Salesforce stood out as top contributors to index performance in the quarter.
