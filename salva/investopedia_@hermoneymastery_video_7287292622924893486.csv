benefits of high-yield savings accounts vs traditional savings accounts,Checking vs. Savings Accounts,Checking and savings accounts may have different interest rates and rules. Learn the difference between checking and savings accounts and how they work.,https://www.investopedia.com/checking-vs-savings-accounts-4783514,"A checking account and a savings account have several key differences such as their interest rates and withdrawal rules. Both are bank accounts designed to keep your money safe. But a checking account is more for holding money for regular spending, while a savings account is designed for longer-term goals.
Learn more about the difference between a checking account and a savings account.
A checking account is an account held at a financial institution that allows you to make credit and debit transactions. These accounts can offer both a debit card and check-writing capabilities.
Withdrawals can take the form of cash withdrawals made at a branch or an automated teller machine (ATM), as well as debit card purchases, checks, money orders, ACH transfers, and wire transfers. Similarly, deposits can be made by depositing cash, checks, or money orders at a branch or an ATM, as well as via mobile check deposit, automated clearing house (ACH) transfer, or wire transfer.
“If you need to use funds for daily transactions, a checking account is the best way to do that,” John Bergquist, President at Lift Financial in South Jordan, Utah, said.
A checking account is useful if you need to:
Checking accounts may or may not be interest-bearing. If it is, the money you deposit earns interest as long as it stays in your account. These accounts can be offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.
A savings account is a deposit account that’s designed for holding funds that aren’t earmarked for everyday use. For example, you might open a savings account to grow your emergency fund, set aside money for a vacation, or build your down payment.
Like checking accounts, savings accounts have different rates and are from different financial institutions like traditional banks, online banks, and credit unions.
You're more likely to earn higher interest with savings accounts. Banks pay savers an annual percentage yield (APY) as an incentive for depositing and keeping money in their savings accounts. The APY savers can earn isn’t uniform, however. It can vary from bank to bank. On average the national savings rate was 0.46% as of Aug. 19, 2024.
1
“An online savings account is a much better option at almost 20 times higher a rate than the traditional checking account,” Bergquist says. “In fact, it’s even very similar to what you would earn when purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond.”
Online banks often have the capability to pass on higher interest rates to savers, owing to their lower overhead and operating costs. The rates can vary widely, but it’s not unthinkable to find high-yield online savings accounts from banks and credit unions earning an APY of up to 5.50%.
An advantage of checking accounts is that withdrawals are virtually unlimited. You could use your card multiple times a day to shop, make daily cash withdrawals, and pay your bills without being penalized. But that may not be the case with your savings account. This started with Regulation D, which was a rule imposed on banks by the Federal Reserve.
According to Regulation D:
Although Regulation D withdrawal restrictions were lifted in April 2020, some financial institutions may still charge their customers excess withdrawal fees if they're made from a savings account.
3
 It's always a good idea to ask your bank or credit union for the rules about your savings account so you're not surprised with fees that you weren't expecting.
When comparing checking and savings accounts, you may find that one is better suited to your needs. In some cases, you may benefit most from using both. Here are some questions to consider when shopping around for a checking or savings account.
You should also check whether the bank offers any special perks for opening an account.
“Banks are highly competitive in a ridiculously low-interest-rate environment, and there are occasional incentives that could make a checking or savings account more attractive,” O’Donnell says. For example, you may be able to join a debit card rewards or discount program that could save you money. Or you could take advantage of promotional deals for opening other accounts, such as a money market or certificate of deposit (CD).
Lastly, keep in mind the kind of access you need when it comes to banking. Whether you choose a checking or savings account, consider whether the bank offers the online and mobile banking tools you need to manage your money digitally, the number of ATM locations, and whether branch banking is available, if that’s something you occasionally use.
Both checking accounts and savings accounts can be valuable tools in your financial life. While they both hold your money safely, they are designed for different purposes. With checking accounts, you can use your money to make convenient purchases. With savings accounts, you can earn some interest and keep your funds safe. Before you open a checking or savings account, compare different rates and terms to ensure you get the best account for you.

current annual percentage yield for high-yield savings accounts,Saving for My Wedding Is So Much Easier With a High-Yield Savings Account,"After getting engaged, I knew we needed to open a high-yield savings account to save money for the wedding. We chose Wealthfront's cash account which pays 4.80% APY.",https://www.investopedia.com/saving-for-wedding-is-easier-with-high-yield-savings-account-8350996,"This column is the first in a series of articles that offer insights into personal experiences with the products and services that you read about on Investopedia every day.
After I got engaged, I was excited to jump into wedding planning right away. But my eagerness faded when I started crunching the numbers. My fiance and I are hoping to save $15,000 by the time the big day rolls around in July 2024, and to do that, we know budgeting and saving money need to be a priority.
Most weddings aren’t cheap, but I didn’t understand just how expensive they can actually be until I started planning my own. The average cost for a wedding in the U.S. in 2023 is $29,000, according to a study from wedding planning site Zola.
1
 To have the celebration that my fiancé and I wanted, we’d need to be diligent about saving money.
We started brainstorming the best ways to save money for major expenses and decided to look into the best high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs).

As a freelance writer who covers financial topics, I consider myself to be pretty well-versed in personal finance. I knew that keeping cash in our low-yield personal bank accounts wasn’t the best way to grow our money, and opening a high-yield savings account together would help us earn more in interest. It would also simplify payments for wedding expenses because we could pull all of the money from a single account.
However, I wanted to be sure that a high-yield savings account would be the best way to reach our financial goal of saving for a wedding. I considered other options, like short-term investments, but realized that we needed something low-risk and easily accessible when making vendor payments.
After I settled on a high-yield savings account and got my fiancé on board, I started looking for the best one. 
I’ve been a Bank of America client for over a decade, but Bank of America doesn’t offer a high-yield savings account. So, I started researching institutions that offer high-yield savings accounts and made a list of some promising options. 
If you’ve ever shopped for something like a mortgage lender, investment brokerage, or even a crypto exchange, you know that it can be overwhelming. There are seemingly endless options on the market, and it’s confusing to figure out which one is the best.
My solution? I looked on Reddit. I knew that most high-yield savings accounts were similar, but I wanted to understand people’s experiences with the bank, the ease of depositing and withdrawing funds, and of course, the current annual percentage yield (APY). 
Unsurprisingly, Reddit was a gold mine of information about which providers were worth considering and which were better avoided. I also read reviews on sites like Trustpilot and checked for any glaring complaints on the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
While I didn’t rely on Reddit to make my final decision, I did use it to narrow down the list of banks to evaluate further. My next step was to compare the best high-yield savings accounts I thought would work for my fiancé and me.
Some of the options I considered were Marcus by Goldman Sachs, LendingClub, Ally Bank, Wealthfront, and SoFi Bank. I analyzed each one based on my most important criteria, which included:
When I first started looking at high-yield savings accounts, I thought they were all the same. However, I quickly realized that some accounts (and the financial institutions that provide them) are better than others.
In the end, my fiancé and I opened a cash account with Wealthfront. While Wealthfront is a robo-advisor, it offers a great cash management account with a competitive APY of 4.80%, which you get regardless of your balance (well above the national average of 0.45%).
2
We started with $2,000 in the account in July 2023, and are hoping to save $13,000 more over the course of 12 months. That's an average of about $1,083 per month that we need to save in our account. Interest in the account compounds monthly so that will help us save even more than $15,000.
3
 For example, if we stuck to this plan, by the end of the 12-month period, we'd have a total of $15,387.58 in the account—almost $350 more than if we saved in an account with a 0.45% interest rate.
We found Wealthfront's website and mobile app incredibly easy to use, and we were able to quickly transfer money from our personal bank accounts to our Wealthfront cash account. We also liked that Wealthfront charges very few fees (just a wire transfer fee and an out-of-network ATM fee) and has unlimited transfers and withdrawals. Money in the account is also protected with up to $8 million in FDIC insurance.
4
It’s worth noting that Wealthfront doesn’t have the highest APY you can find—Popular Direct offers 5.40% APY. However, I found that Wealthfront had a better user experience than these other financial institutions.
With a high-yield savings account, the APY will fluctuate. I felt more comfortable choosing an account that was secure, flexible, and easy to use, even if it meant getting a slightly lower rate.

Since opening our Wealthfront cash account, I’ve realized just how easy it can be to save money for big expenses. We schedule regular deposits into our account and see the money grow. Plus, it’s completely separate from our personal savings accounts, so there’s no temptation to spend the money we’re trying to save.
If you’re actively saving money for something in the short term, whether it’s a vacation, new car, down payment, or just a rainy day fund, I would highly recommend opening a high-yield savings account to make your life easier.
Many reputable financial institutions offer high-yield savings accounts with no monthly fees and generous APYs. Whether you set up recurring deposits or just contribute what you can, when you can, it’s a great tool to save money without any risk.

However, I found that I liked Wealthfront's user experience more than these other financial institutions, so I was OK trading a lower interest rate for a better experience.

current annual percentage yield for high-yield savings accounts,"Today's Top Money Market Account Rates, June 30, 2023: Are They Better Than Savings Rates?","The highest rate on a money market account right now is 5.25%, which is higher than the top savings account rate of 5.17% APY. Both pay at least nine times the national average rate.",https://www.investopedia.com/todays-top-money-market-account-interest-rates-better-savings-account-rates-7510614,"The top rate on a money market account today is 5.25%, which is a little higher than the current top annual percentage yield (APY) on a high-yield savings account. The latter has a top rate of 5.17%. So if you're looking for the absolute best place to stash your savings until you need it, right now the top money market account is the better option.
Traditionally, money market accounts were known for requiring higher minimum balances and offering higher interest rates than high-yield savings accounts. But nowadays, that isn't always the case. Both accounts offer competitive rates and high-yield savings accounts usually pay more as a group.
For example, the top money market account rate may currently be higher overall, but the range of rates for the top 15 savings accounts, from about a hundred that Investopedia tracks every day, is narrower and collectively higher. Namely, while the top 15 money market account rates range from 4.15% to 5.25% APY, the top 15 high-yield savings account rates range from 4.81% to 5.17% APY. So if you don't care for the features or requirements of the top money market account, you'll have a greater number of high-paying options in our high-yield savings account ranking.

Today's savings rates are the highest we have seen in more than 15 years. They have reached record levels thanks to the Federal Reserve's mission to tame inflation. The federal funds rate has been increased 10 times over the last 15 months, and it may not be done yet.
1
 The Fed meets again this week, and at the same time, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is released on Wednesday. While it's widely expected that the Fed will pause rate hikes on Wednesday, the inflation report may give us some indication as to whether we could see another rate hike at the Fed's July meeting.
2
If the Fed does hold on rates this Wednesday, rates on the best money market and high-yield savings accounts may also hold steady. Regardless, the top rate offered by a money market account is almost nine times the national average rate of 0.59% APY, while the top rate on a high-yield savings account is almost 13 times better than the 0.40% APY national average. So it makes sense to not only act soon, but to shop around for a leading rate from our rankings.
3
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer money market, savings accounts, and CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

Views may not be representative, see more reviews at the App Store and Google Play Store. Learn more about this relationship.
Robo-advisors continue to disrupt traditional investment service models. The number of robo-advisor options can make it confusing to determine which one best suits you. Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios present two intriguing choices that have distinct features but share a common mission of making portfolio management simpler, smarter, and more accessible to everyone. Additionally, both companies are among the winners in our list of the best robo-advisors of 2024, with Betterment winning best for beginners, cash management, tax-loss harvesting, and crypto while E*TRADE Core Portfolios wins best for mobile.
E*TRADE began in 1982 as a discount broker before growing into a top trading platform, eventually expanding into digital investment management by launching Core Portfolios. Morgan Stanley’s 2020 acquisition of E*TRADE further bolstered its position in the industry and has led to a deeper asset pool and new services like tax-loss harvesting. Betterment arrived on the scene with its robo-advisor service in 2010. An early challenger to conventional portfolio management, Betterment continues to think ahead as illustrated by its addition of cryptocurrency portfolios.
1
 Compare the two and all that they offer to see if one of these robo-advisors is right for your financial situation.
Betterment has a smooth, simple onboarding process with a clear emphasis on a friendly user experience. To get started you’ll share your goals, investment experience, and other personal information to help the system identify a portfolio best geared toward your profile. Accounts can have different investment allocations based on separate goals, ensuring each portfolio accommodates your preferences. Like many robo-advisors, the investment strategy generally follows a passive approach based on modern portfolio theory (MPT) and invests in the market through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that combine to make up different risk levels (crypto allocations are made separately). While there is no minimum required to open and maintain an account at Betterment, a deposit of just $10 is required to start investing. If you’re looking for further guidance, you can access human advisors through separately purchased packages or at the premium tier once you have deposited $100,000.

3
Creating a Core Portfolios account at E*TRADE is similarly straightforward and intuitive. Before you invest, E*TRADE offers a risk tolerance questionnaire to help assess your investment profile, factor in deposit estimates, and generate potential portfolio allocations. When you’re ready to get started, the Core Portfolios strategy requires at least a $500 initial deposit. In terms of investment approach, E*Trade’s Core Portfolios also follow a classic, passive strategy based on modern portfolio theory.
4
 Your money will be invested in ETFs exclusively. Investment advisors are accessible to prospective and current users without an additional fee, although this service is more geared toward getting you set up on the platform.  
The onboarding process at both digital investment advisors is relatively quick, easy, and entirely digital, but we give a slight nod to Betterment here since there is no investment minimum compared to E*TRADE Core Portfolios’ $500 minimum.
E*TRADE and Betterment both offer the most commonly used investment account types, with a couple of differences. Betterment supports trust accounts and a high-interest cash management option. While E*TRADE Core Portfolios doesn’t offer these accounts, support is provided for Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts that Betterment doesn’t offer.
Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios both have the most commonly used account types. If you are looking for trust accounts, 529 plans, or high-interest checking accounts, then Betterment may have an edge, but the same is true of E*TRADE Core Portfolios if you want a custodial account.
Transferring funds into and out of Betterment can be done seamlessly and without a fee by linking your bank to the platform. You can also transfer other investment accounts to the platform with relative ease. Once your money is on Betterment’s platform, you can use cash management services or automate your portfolio management. While these are all helpful tools to manage your money, Betterment does not offer lending services and margin accounts. 
E*TRADE’s Core Portfolios lets you set up regularly scheduled deposits that are easy to adjust as your financial situation changes. Other financial transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, or moving money to other E*TRADE accounts are simple to set up. While financial tools such as margin, stock trading, and options aren’t available through Core Portfolios, you can access these features in other areas of E*TRADE’s product ecosystem. 
Betterment won our best for cash management award for robo-advisors with a strong lineup that includes a checking account, debit card, and high-yield cash reserve account with a 5.00% variable APY.*
7
 Combined with portfolio management and financial planning options, Betterment provides various offerings if you’re looking to consolidate your finances under one umbrella.
E*TRADE’s Core Portfolios has limited cash management options in comparison. Cash in the portfolio is swept into a money market account so you can potentially earn a little higher interest than a traditional bank savings account offers. The minimum cash balance in your portfolio is 1% and it is swept into a Morgan Stanley bank deposit program for a yield of 0.01%.
4
 While other cash management features such as checking or bill pay aren’t available through Core Portfolios, you can access these options in other areas of E*TRADE’s site. 
*Cash Reserve is only available to clients of Betterment LLC, which is not a bank, and cash transfers to program banks are conducted through the clients’ brokerage accounts at Betterment Securities. For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.
Checking accounts and the Betterment Visa Debit Card provided and issued by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Checking made available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment Financial LLC, nor any of their affiliates, is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC reimburses ATM fees and the Visa® 1% foreign transaction fee worldwide, everywhere Visa is accepted.
Betterment has more options for cash management than E*TRADE's Core Portfolio, but it is important to note that there are options in E*TRADE's larger financial ecosystem.

Goal planning is one of the key features of a strong digital investment advisor, and Betterment stands out here thanks to a broad and powerful range of tools, calculators, and goal-planning options. The goals you can choose from include general investing, retirement, major purchases, emergency funds, and education.
8
 If you fall behind on your goals, you’ll be prompted to adjust your strategy so you can get back on track. Betterment also allows you to link external financial accounts to the platform so you can get a better sense of your overall picture. Pairing these features with the available digital financial planning tools can help you get an insightful assessment of the likelihood of reaching your financial destination.
E*TRADE’s Core Portfolios platform doesn’t focus on goal-planning tools and features. This is intentional, as the experience is geared towards a streamlined portfolio management approach without unnecessarily complicating your dashboard with separate goals. As a result, you’ll use a single bucket of money to fund all of your financial objectives. Reporting progress on your goal is easy to follow, but you won’t receive tailored prompts to help improve your situation. Linking other E*TRADE accounts to the Core Portfolios site can give you a bit more insight, but other financial accounts can’t be synced. E*TRADE does provide you with extensive research and education resources to help supplement the planning experience, with some tools and calculators embedded in these sections. However, these features aren’t located within the Core Portfolios planning experience, limiting their usefulness.
When it comes to goal planning, Betterment has a clear edge over E*TRADE due to its far more comprehensive range of tools and taking external financial holdings into account. 
Betterment uses ETFs exclusively to build portfolios.
9
 These allocations are divided up into several subcategories that include:
The portfolio makeup of E*TRADE Core Portfolios includes a variety of ETFs that can be combined to make up a variety of risk levels.
4
 While the investment strategy closely follows modern portfolio theory across the board, you have the ability to include socially conscious, income-focused, or smart beta ETFs as part of your investment allocation. These allocations are all highly diversified internationally and domestically across equity and fixed income. E*TRADE has increased the pool of assets it is pulling from as part of its tie-up with Morgan Stanley, so there are more global equities of all sizes being used to construct your diversified portfolio. E*TRADE Core Portfolios has also added an all-equity option for users with the highest risk tolerance.
Betterment offers a Flexible Portfolio feature which gives you more say over how investments are allocated in your account.
10
 All Betterment portfolios let you adjust risk levels, but the Flexible Portfolio lets you go further by choosing amounts to allocate towards specific asset classes. Advanced investors will find this an especially intriguing option to fine-tune their portfolio.
E*TRADE offers the ability to customize your allocation as part of the available portfolio tooling. However, this is limited to risk level adjustments and portfolio preference opt-ins such as socially responsible, smart beta, and income-focused ETFs. While these features help align the portfolio to your liking, the level of customization is less than what Betterment offers. 
Betterment's Flexible Portfolio feature offers more opportunities to customize than E*TRADE Core Portfolios.

Automatic rebalancing is one of the fundamental portfolio management strategies that both Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios offer, albeit with slightly different approaches.
Betterment can rebalance your portfolio when the allocation drifts beyond your target allocation threshold and when the account balance minimum has been reached or passed.
11
 If you link external accounts, you can receive additional recommendations for your goals. 
E*TRADE will rebalance your allocation automatically on a semi-annual basis or when the portfolio drifts more than 5% from the initial weighting.
4
 A rebalance is also triggered if cash exceeds more than 6% of your holdings. E*TRADE also keeps you informed on market movements that could impact your portfolio allocations.
Both robo-advisors offer rebalancing features and similarly have a threshold if the account drifts away from its set goals. Although there are some unique differences between the two robo-advisors, such as Betterment allowing external accounts or E*Trade Core Portfolio's informing investors of market movements, the award could go either way depending on the needs of the investor and what they are looking for in a robo-advisor.
Ensuring your taxable accounts are tax-optimized is an important aspect of portfolio management. Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios both offer tax-loss harvesting for users who have taxable accounts. Both robo-advisors also undertake tax optimization where tax-advantaged investments like municipal bond funds are prioritized in taxable accounts.
While no two robo-advisors will be identical in how they optimize and tax-loss harvest within a portfolio, both E*TRADE Core Portfolios and Betterment carry out these processes so you can hold on to more of the capital you earn in your portfolio.
Betterment is not a licensed tax advisor. Tax Loss Harvesting+ (TLH+) is not suitable for all investors. Read more at https://www.betterment.com/legal/tax-loss-harvesting and consider your personal circumstances before deciding whether to utilize Betterment’s TLH+ feature. Investing involves risk. Performance not guaranteed.
E*TRADE and Betterment prioritize your financial security to ensure your assets are safeguarded. Standard Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage is in place on both platforms for missing funds, which covers up to $500,000 total value or $250,000 cash in your account.
12
13
 E*TRADE has excess SIPC coverage through Morgan Stanley to an aggregated limit of $1 billion for securities and $1.9 million per client for uninvested cash.
13
 Both platforms also protect your data through encryption, two-factor authentication, and account monitoring. 
Your portfolio is safe at either of these companies, but we give E*TRADE Core Portfolios the edge here due to the excess SIPC coverage it has as part of the larger Morgan Stanley financial universe.

Betterment investors will find a user-friendly experience throughout the site with financial tools, reporting, and calculators that are intuitive and easy to use. Performance metrics, account details, and dashboard functionality are readily accessible and simple to navigate. If you connect outside accounts to Betterment, you’ll find it relatively effortless to monitor your finances.
The E*TRADE Core Portfolios desktop experience is also relatively simple to maneuver. The tabs, reports, and tools on the pages are spaced out to give an uncluttered feel to the site. Educational resources and research materials are also easy to find. Although account linking is limited to other E*TRADE holdings, you can quickly get a sense of how you are doing financially if you hold more than one account with the brokerage. 
Betterment scores highly for its mobile experience, ranking 4.7 out of 5 for the iOS version and 4.6 out of 5 for Android.

 The mobile app has all the features and functionality that you would expect to see on the desktop experience, which is welcome news to users who prefer to access their portfolio from the app.
E*TRADE’s mobile experience is outstanding, winning our best in category for robo-advisors. The mobile app is sleek and exceptionally easy to navigate, especially during the mobile account opening process. Reporting and performance metrics are also very clearly understood. Users of other E*TRADE platforms will find that the Core Portfolios experience is a seamless transition.
Betterment’s customer service team is available by phone and email from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. If you’re part of the Premium Investing service, you’ll have unlimited access to financial planners. Investors who purchase advice packages can also engage with advisors based on the package offered. The FAQ and site resources are sufficient for most general inquiries as well.
E*TRADE’s phone lines are available 24/7. You can talk to a financial advisor on the phone or walk into a physical location for help. Keep in mind that this advice is generally more limited to ensuring you are set up on the platform correctly. The online FAQs are somewhat limited, although most general inquiries can be answered online. 
Overall, E*TRADE Core Portfolios has better customer service than Betterment because it is easier to get people on the phone to help. Whether this matters depends largely on how you prefer to access help.
Fees are an important starting point when exploring a relationship with a financial institution so you can be sure that you’re getting the value, products, and support needed to drive your desired financial outcomes. 
Betterment provides two separate experiences with different fee structures. The Investing plan includes digital advice, tax-loss harvesting, automatic rebalancing, and the full suite of accounts and portfolios for a 0.25% annual fee or $4 per month for balances under $20,000 that do not deposit at least $250 per month. The Premium Investing plan is priced at 0.65% annually and includes the Investing plan features plus unlimited communication with a certified financial planner. This additional fee is applied to assets in the investment and cryptocurrency accounts, but not cash accounts. For accounts with at least $2 million, there is a fee discount of 0.10%. Crypto accounts are charged an annual fee of 1% plus trading expenses. Additional costs not included in either plan fee are ongoing ETF fund fees, ranging from 0.05% to 0.13%. It is important to note that you don't have to opt for premiums at higher balances. You can stick with the 0.25% investing product.
16
E*TRADE Core Portfolios has an annual fee of 0.30% of assets under management.
17
 This fee is assessed quarterly based on the average daily balance and is deducted from your cash in the account. The portfolios hold between 1% and 6% in cash so that assets don’t have to be unnecessarily liquidated to pay fees. There are no additional trading fees associated with your account, but there are ongoing expenses for the ETFs that make up your portfolio ranging from 0.05% for the lowest cost to 0.16% for some of the SRI or smart beta funds. 
Both of these robo-advisors offer low fees, but Betterments has a slight edge. The fees at Betterment are balance-dependent, however, so there will be cases in the $500 to $20,000 balance area where E*TRADE Core Portfolios has lower fees if you do not meet Betterment's $250 monthly deposit.
Betterment and E*TRADE Core Portfolios both provide strong portfolio management options to help manage your money in a more cost-effective way than traditional solutions. Deciding between the two offerings depends on your goals, investment background, customization preferences, and desire for additional financial guidance. Existing E*TRADE users looking to simplify and automate their portfolio strategy will find a seamless transition when utilizing the Core Portfolios platform. The ability to link other E*TRADE accounts and an excellent mobile experience are other nice features to keep in mind as well. 
Even so, Betterment clearly stands out for tremendous goal setting, financial planning, cash management, and portfolio customization functionality. The option to link a wide range of external financial accounts and invest in crypto further enhances the money management tools at your disposal. While the premium tier costs slightly more than E*TRADE’s Core Portfolios, Betterment is the only option with balances below $500 and the standard offering is cheaper at most balance levels. There is a little quirk with Betterment costing more on a $4 monthly charge than E*TRADE Core Portfolios on balances between $500 and $16,000. Overall, however, Betterment provides a cheaper and much more robust platform on your journey towards improving your financial standing. 
Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We used our 2023 consumer survey to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 robo-advisor awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 64 questions to each of the 21 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Jan. 8 to Feb. 9, 2024.
We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 59 criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:
Additionally, during our 2023 research, many of the companies we reviewed granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.
Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.
Read more about how we research and review robo-advisors.
Separately, our research team conducted a survey of 205 U.S. adults aged 18 to 72 who are current clients of one of 18 robo-advisors. While the information collected did not influence the development of our ratings model, it was instrumental in gathering the valuable insights published in Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey.
Participants in our 2023 Robo-Advisor Survey opted in to an online, self-administered questionnaire from a market research vendor. Data collection took place between Aug. 30 and Sept. 15, 2023, with 11 video interviews conducted with volunteer respondents from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17, 2023. Multiple quality checks, including screeners, attention gauges, comprehension evaluations, and logic metrics, among others, were used to ensure only the highest quality responses were included.
The above material and content should not be considered to be a recommendation. Investing in digital assets is highly speculative and volatile, and only suitable for investors who are able to bear the risk of potential loss and experience sharp drawdowns. Digital assets are not legal tender and are not backed by the U.S. government.

potential earnings comparison high-yield vs traditional savings,Charles Schwab vs. E*TRADE,"Charles Schwab and E*TRADE measure up well in a head-to-head showdown, with both brokerages offering a comprehensive variety of financial services at highly competitive rates.",https://www.investopedia.com/charles-schwab-vs-e-trade-4587938,"Charles Schwab and E*TRADE are both heavyweights and early entrants into online brokerage. Their long experience in the business and very large customer base provide them both with significant resources to invest in their platforms and services. Although Charles Schwab is the larger of the two, both brokers have the size and experience to serve investors and traders of all types. They have also grown even larger in recent years, after Morgan Stanley purchased E*TRADE in 2020, and following Schwab's purchase of TD Ameritrade in the same year.
1
2
 In 2024, size matters because larger firms are able to expand access to new assets like spot cryptocurrency ETFs.
E*TRADE and Charles Schwab were quick to go commission-free for stocks and ETFs.
3
4
 They also offer similarly excellent tools and screeners as part of their platforms. While E*TRADE and Schwab are both very good online brokers that have many common features on their respective mobile, web, and desktop platforms, and consistently rank highly in all the categories we measure. we will take a closer look at the differences between them to help you decide which is right for your investing or trading needs.
Both Charles Schwab and E*TRADE have robust platforms that offer streaming quotes and allow you to trade stocks and ETFs commission-free.
3
4
 The two brokers have the capability to handle conditional market orders on their intuitive platforms. Charles Schwab and E*TRADE also make it easy to check balances, access fundamental and financial information, and conduct research on stocks.
Both platforms have a web version and a streaming version, with the streaming versions being the most robust. Schwab has a single mobile app offering, while E*TRADE has a mobile platform for each of its online and computer workstations that replicates the web or desktop experience.
Overall, we found E*TRADE’s platforms easier to use, but this category was very close. 

Charles Schwab has a website and a fully integrated thinkorswim online and desktop platforms, all of which have real-time data streams and stock screeners.
5
 While the website does not offer many customization options, thinkorswim's platforms can all be customized for things such as information shown in the top account balances line, the ability to save specific stock or ETF searches, and even the ability to customize the trade ticket. Thinkorswim greatly increased the charting capabilities at Schwab and provided an upgrade to Schwab's whole trading experience.
E*TRADE’s offerings include a standard website that, while mostly intuitive, has a two-level menu system that can sometimes be confusing. Trading on E*TRADE is simple and straightforward: Enter a symbol, select an order type and quantity, and preview and approve. E*TRADE’s platforms allow you to create customizable watchlist views and the watchlists can be easily created from screeners. More advanced traders will lean towards the Power E*TRADE platform with powerful charts, technical pattern recognition, probability analysis, and other trading tools.
6
E*TRADE’s recent platform redesign has improved its options offerings, as it now uses a drop-down menu that shows the various strategies and can even help determine a strategy based on risk tolerance and sentiment on the expected price direction of the security. E*TRADE allows users to trade directly from a chart, and you can track your order visually.
While the technology was quite close and both brokers offer screening tools, portfolio analytics, news, and educational material, we feel Schwab's integration of thinkorswim puts it slightly above E*TRADE in terms of serving the most active traders.

Charles Schwab’s mobile platform is intuitive and easy to use, and you can trade the same asset classes as the desktop version. Investors and traders can see basic information such as balances and news on stocks in your portfolio. The Schwab mobile app also provides charts, Schwab’s research rating, a quote summary, news, earnings and announcements, and margin requirements for individual securities. Schwab provides an easy drop-down menu for selecting up to four leg options strategies, but the mobile app does not provide options profitability graphs or high level options analytics.
The mobile platform’s inability to handle contingent orders is another notable weakness. Schwab’s mobile app will meet the needs of most investors, but active traders (especially options traders), will prefer the thinkorswim mobile app that fully mirrors the features of the thinkorswim desktop and web apps. Again, this is a big change for Schwab in terms of closing the gap with E*TRADE when it comes to active traders.
E*TRADE offers its customers the choice of two mobile apps corresponding to the different platforms, web and desktop. The E*TRADE mobile app is focused on watchlists, market research, quotes, and portfolio management, so it is excellent for investors, but less so for active traders. The regular E*TRADE app, just like the website, provides third-party investment research, real-time data streaming, and market news from Bloomberg TV. Now with Morgan Stanley as an owner, Morgan Stanley research is available through the app (and all platforms).
The Power E*TRADE app is designed for active investors and traders, and has a deeper set of tools and functions. This includes the ability to trade stocks, ETFs, basic and complex options up to four legs, and futures all from a single trade ticket. E*TRADE's mobile apps also support contingent orders. E*TRADE’s apps do not have fixed income, so active bond investors will find an important gap at E*TRADE. 
Overall, we give Charles Schwab the edge for mobile offerings. It is very close, with both brokers giving investors the option to pick the app that best suits them, but thinkorswim brings a fresh experience aimed at heavy traders to Schwab.

Charles Schwab and E*TRADE both have very similar offerings. Neither of them offer direct exposure to cryptocurrency, but you'll find a wide range of assets at either broker.
The Charles Schwab and E*TRADE platforms both provide multiple order types. Schwab offers one-triggers-other (OTO), one-triggers-two orders (OTT), one-cancels-other (OCO), and orders contingent on spread price, price, volume, and time on its desktop platform. Thinkorswim also offers traders an opportunity to enter more sophisticated orders, such as a limit order with an OCO contingent order, and stop loss and profit taking levels.
E*TRADE offers contingent, bracketed, OTO, OCO, one-triggers-a-one-cancels-other (OTOCO) on its website and desktop platforms, and contingent and OTO orders on its mobile platforms.
We give Schwab the edge because of the specialized orders available through thinkorswim.

Schwab provides price improvement on more than 97.5% of its orders by using its own proprietary order routing system with an average execution speed of 0.03 seconds and a savings to investors averaging $22.84 per order (500-1,999 share trades in S&P 500 shares).
7
 E*TRADE also uses its own system for order routing and the average time to fill an order is approximately 0.17 seconds with a price improvement of $9.91 per order (100-9,999 share trades in S&P 500 shares).
8
 These are not apples-to-apples comparisons. In our analysis, we found that Charles Schwab generally saw $0.0190 per share in price improvement and E*TRADE came in lower at $0.0092 per share. In terms of payment for order flow (PFOF), something both brokers accept, E*TRADE was higher with $0.0014 per share to Charles Schwab's $0.0006 in the period we looked at. These are nowhere near the industry leaders in PFOF, but still worth noting.
Both firms offer portfolio margining, but Schwab offers fractional shares while E*TRADE only offers fractional shares in its dividend reinvestment and robo-advisor offerings.
Both fill their orders quickly, but Schwab gets the small edge over E*TRADE for trading technology.

Both Schwab and E*TRADE were quick to adopt commission-free trading, so neither company charges commissions for stock and ETF trades. E*TRADE charges options traders with less than 30 trades per quarter $0.65 per contract and $0.50 per contract for active traders with over 30 trades. Schwab charges $0.65 per options contract for all traders. For those trading over-the-counter stocks, Schwab charges $6.95, while E*TRADE charges $6.95 for less active investors and $4.95 for more active account holders. Neither company charges inactivity or minimum fees, and both charge $25 for broker assisted trades.
9
10
In fixed income, Schwab does not charge commissions for T-Bills, Notes, bonds, TIPS, and new certificate of deposit (CD) issues.
11
 At E*TRADE, secondary market transactions for CDs and corporate, municipal, agency, and zero-coupon bonds are $1 per bond, with a $10 minimum and $250 maximum commission.
12
 E*TRADE is less expensive for trading mutual funds outside of the no transaction fee program, with E*TRADE charging $0 per trade compared to $74.95 at Schwab.
13
At Schwab, margin rates are slightly lower than E*TRADE’s. E*TRADE charges 14.20% for account balances of $10,000, and Schwab comes in at 13.575%. As the balances go up, the difference remains roughly consistent, with Schwab charging 12.075% at $100,000 to E*TRADE's 12.70%.
14
15
While it is a bit of a mixed bag in regards to which products you specifically trade, Schwab offers lower margin rates and fixed income fees, giving it the edge in costs. E*TRADE may still appeal to lower-balance account holders who want robo-portfolios. Traders focusing on options trading are likely to find Schwab and E*TRADE pricey in comparison to lower cost brokers catering to this market.
Both E*TRADE and Schwab have excellent research, news, account analytics, screeners, calculators, and tax reporting tools for account holders. E*TRADE has seen a jump in the amount of quality research available across platforms with the integration of Morgan Stanley's offerings and ratings. We found Schwab to have the better ETF screener, but both brokers had strong screeners in addition to options-specific screeners. E*TRADE’s charting offering used to be better than Schwab’s because it has better drawing tools and you can visually see orders and positions on charts. Schwab's integration of thinkorswim has erased that edge as both platforms now have great charting tools and technical studies.
E*TRADE no longer has a large charting edge on Schwab. Both firms continue to expand the breadth of information they give to investors.

Both Schwab and E*TRADE have excellent suites of analytics for accounts, margin, and buying power, in addition to calculators covering retirement and long term planning.
16
17
 They also offer all the tax reporting tools an investor needs.
18
19
The brokers are both excellent in this category. Schwab and E*TRADE offer portfolio analysis galore along with excellent tools but Schwab gets the thinkorswim bump here due to the additional backtesting capabilities it brings for active traders.

Again, both platforms have a broad range of educational offerings, including many articles, videos, and classes. E*TRADE has a lot of good information for new investors covering long-term investing, tax planning, and options and futures. E*TRADE also recently introduced Virtual Learning Environments, which are full-day structured online events with targeted learning objectives, such as beginner options. Schwab also has a very robust array of educational offerings.
Both E*Trade and Schwab increased the volume of webcasts and online events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Schwab offers more of this programming than E*Trade. Schwab also has a branch network to assist customers further, while E*Trade has been absorbed into Morgan Stanley's branch presence.
We give the edge to Schwab in the education category because of the volume of information, including five hours of daily live programming, and a branch network with professionals that can also educate investors.

Both E*TRADE and Schwab offer customer service to account holders and potential customers with 24/7 support by phone. Additionally, Schwab offers support via chat with a live person. The support received is generally good, and customers can speak with live brokers and financial advisors.
20
21
E*TRADE's customer service is not lacking, but Schwab’s customer service is better and it also has a branch network that can provide service. Schwab has the advantage in customer service. 

Schwab and E*TRADE are tied when it comes to security. Both Schwab and E*TRADE have strong security that includes two-factor authentication for all platforms.
22
23
 E*TRADE hasn't reported any significant outages or data breaches in the past year. Schwab hasn't experienced outages or data breaches in the past year either.
Schwab carries excess Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance provided by London insurers with an aggregate limit of $600 million, limited to a combined return to any customer of $150 million, including cash of up to $1.15 million.
24
 E*TRADE clients will be covered under the Morgan Stanley excess of Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) supplemental insurance policy, which has an aggregate limit of $1 billion. This amount is above and beyond the required insurance by SIPC.
25
Charles Schwab and E*TRADE are both up to industry standards when it comes to security.
Charles Schwab and E*TRADE both offer the full range of commonly used account types. This includes:
There are some differences with E*TRADE offering an IRA specifically for minors and Schwab offering a global account with access to 12 international markets in local currency.
28
27
 That said, most investors will find the account types they need with either broker.

While E*TRADE and Schwab are very competitive with each other, we give the nod to Schwab for the average investor by the smallest of margins. This is because Schwab has better customer service, a larger breadth of educational offerings, superior screeners, and lower commissions for fixed income. More importantly, Schwab closed a big gap in trading experience for more active investors by finally finishing the integration of thinkorswim and the retirement of the TD Ameritrade brand. That said, the competition was very close, and other investors may find E*TRADE the better choice. E*TRADE is cheaper in terms of options with enough volume and has a comparable trading platform.
All in all, however, both brokers are excellent choices for the majority of investors and traders. The main exceptions are highly sophisticated traders that want control over routing their own orders, even lower options commissions, and direct access to cryptocurrencies. 

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024.
We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories:

Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

potential earnings comparison high-yield vs traditional savings,tastytrade Review 2024,"Learn how tastytrade compares to other brokers. This tastytrade review covers usability, cost, trade experience, order types, and more.",https://www.investopedia.com/tastytrade-review-4587986,"Tastytrade is best suited for experienced and active option traders. These users generally love the tastytrade platform, while users new to option trading may find its many features bewildering at first. Tastytrade has built its stellar reputation on helping active traders magnify their own efforts through the platform’s high-powered functionality. The platform was thoughtfully constructed to help even novice traders learn their way around. The broker’s fee structure rewards active traders of stocks, options, and futures, making it an attractive choice for frequent traders. Certainly the buy-and-hold investor crowd will think that using a tastytrade brokerage account is like using a sledgehammer on a pushpin. However, even these users would admit to being surprised at the valuable analytical tools available on the platform. That’s a big part of what makes tastytrade a legitimate choice as a brokerage for any user, but especially for active traders.  

The broker formerly known as tastyworks officially changed its name to tastytrade in 2023, but that change only reaffirmed the company’s commitment to customer satisfaction. Launched in 2017, tastytrade is one of the fastest-growing online brokerage firms in the world. It was designed by the founders of thinkorswim with sophisticated functionality for robust trading in options and futures. Though it has a do-it-yourself vibe and provides the technology, education, and support a retail trader needs to succeed, it brings industrial-level tools and execution to a retail crowd.
1
 It is a valid question to ask whether this platform gives you what you want in a brokerage because not everyone will feel that it does. This review will take a look at how tastytrade ranks against its more established rivals to help you decide whether it is the right fit for your needs.
When it comes to usability the tastytrade platform stands out. The brokerage frequently wins awards and acclaim, much of it related to the well-designed user experience. The guiding principle behind the design can be summed up in six words: see it, click it, trade it.
2
 
The team behind the user experience relies heavily on user feedback to tweak the operation of features so that the platform helps traders do the kind of analysis they like. For example, users can create watch lists and sort them by their implied volatility (IV) score–something you care a lot about if you are an active options trader.
This kind of hyper-focused design makes the platform seem obvious to the target user it is designed for, but rather oblique to those simply looking to run screeners for selecting mutual funds. 
It helps to remember that company founders Tom Sosnoff and Scott Sheridan were 20-year veterans of the options pits at the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange). They built the tastytrade platform to be the tool they wished they had back in their floor-trader days, but with access to modern markets such as cryptocurrencies and small-exchange futures contracts, and the ability to extend to whatever markets become popular. 
Admittedly there is a lot to look at on the platform. However, when it comes to execution, the platform is designed to help you complete an order with a minimum of clicks and scrolling. But it goes beyond that. The team at tastytrade listens closely to user feedback as they work to home in on the optimal implementation of the user interface. So not only can you search out options on ETFs with high trading volume and open interest, but you can also execute a market-order trade in as little as two well-placed clicks. 
Traders can choose between three viewing modes in the interface—table mode (a typical options chain view), analysis mode (which focuses on comparing prices and relative values), or curve mode (to help visualize the profit and loss potential of your trading strategy). 
Using either view, you can access predefined trading strategies such as butterfly, straddle, iron condor, and more. As part of using these modes, traders can see the options they have selected and all of the associated statistics, including the probability of profit, delta, theta, standard deviation, P/L, implied volatility, the expected move, max profit/loss, expiration dates, prices, and more. This makes for a sophisticated analysis of the option positions with the intent to improve the probability of trading profitability. 
Tastytrade provides four separate trading mediums: a website portal, a desktop program, a mobile app for iOS and Android, and an app specifically for use on the iPad/iOS.
3
 The first two are similar but the mobile apps differ in presentation based on available screen sizes. There is very little that can be done on the desktop or web-based versions of the tastytrade platform that can’t be done through the mobile platform. All order types and analysis are available with only the exception of some of the charting functions.
The mobile platform is smartly designed, but not meant to be a simple single-thumb interaction experience. The interface on mobile devices is designed to optimize available screen space. For example, the appearance of advanced order entry screens provides all the same options in its display, but has them rearranged to accommodate the more compact screen (see graphics).
Tastytrade offers users the ability to trade in stocks and ETFs, futures (both indexes and commodities), and of course every available option contract on all of the types of underlying assets they trade with. You can trade options on stocks, as well as options on futures and indexes. You can even trade options on option-oriented indexes such as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX).
4
In 2024 tastytrade also made Treasury bond trading and investing possible, though you have to call the trading desk to implement orders. There is a $25 fee to open a Treasury bond position (regardless of size), and a $25 fee to close it. There is no fee for holding it to maturity. Once a Treasury bond position is open, it will display among the trader’s open positions on the platform.
5
Traders looking for a wide selection of order types to help manage their options positions will not be disappointed in tastytrade's offering.
Some of the more popular order types available on the tastytrade platform are as follows:
These orders are, like so much else in the platform, optimized for active option traders who want to carry out their option trading strategies most effectively.
Tastytrade is a technology-driven broker, which brings many advantages to trading through its platform. Like many brokers today, tastytrade uses a proprietary order routing system. The platform’s algorithms focus on order fill quality and price improvement. The electronic system will route orders to the market maker that will yield favorable execution for the customer. Customers have even mentioned the fill performance on Trustpilot reviews.
6
Another advantage is that tastytrade offers fractional share trading, which makes higher priced stocks accessible even for smaller account sizes. If your favorite stock is trading for $1,000 per share, but your account only has $500 of buying power available, you could enter an order for .5 shares (or less) and get a fill. The fee for doing so is ten cents per trade.
7
 
No matter what the size of a trader’s account is, they are likely to find the strongest feature of this platform, by far, is its sophisticated analytics. The wide variety of ways to research and analyze an option trade or trading strategy leaves all other competitors behind. 
It’s hard to imagine a way for any retail trader to get an edge in the overly competitive world of option trading, which is so heavily dominated by sophisticated math-driven pricing models. Yet tastytrade finds a way to make such advantages freely available to its customers each day through the design of its interface. It not only identifies pricing and strategy data (see illustration below), but helps a trader focus on where a pricing advantage might exist no matter what strategy is selected.
The base commission for option trading is $1 per contract and it is capped at $10 per trade (or per leg in combination trades). This innovative pricing means that a one-contract option trader is paying more than they might elsewhere, but a 100-contract trader is paying about ten-cents per contract. That’s nearly impossible to beat. As a bonus, there is no cost to close option positions making this platform the most cost-efficient option in the market. In addition to these prices, the following fees apply:
Of course there is no fee to access the platform, and there are no fees for ACH deposits and withdrawals.
8
The methods in which brokers make money from you have become less transparent over the years. Here are some ways tastytrade makes money from your business: 
Conversely, here are a couple ways tastytrade makes money for you:
The tastytrade platform was built in-house using proprietary technology and brings to bear all the decades of experience collectively captured among its senior staff members. It offers limited portfolio analysis tools and no third-party research resources. Since tastytrade is built for the frequent trading of options, most of its research amenities are designed to help you act like a market maker.
The tastytrade platform doesn’t have a dedicated stock screening tool, however, it does have sophisticated watchlist tools that accomplish a similar task. The platform has nine major categories of these characteristics (see table below).
The platform does not have a dedicated platform screener as found in thinkorswim (the other Sossnoff-inspired option-trading platform). The prebuilt or custom-built watchlists.and analysis tools go a long way to helping you find trade ideas the way a screener does. 

One feature of the platform is an important calculation device. The purpose for it is subtle, but the impact can be powerful for a trader. Actively trading multiple option positions may generate more portfolio heat, or combined trade risk, than a trader anticipates. To help with this the tastytrade platform has a feature called the Portfolio Risk Analysis Tool. It can help you identify whether too many of your options are highly correlated to one another.
12
tastytrade has robust, interactive charting tools with over 250 available technical studies that can be used to analyze price and volume action. Fundamental research and news are also available. Chart windows can be detached from the main screen and spread across a multi-monitor setup for unlimited customization.
Within the platform tastytrade provides a link where you can follow any one of 20 ongoing feeds from tastylive experts such as Tom Sossnoff, Tony and Nick Battista, Liz Dierking, Jenny Andrews and many others. These expert option traders not only give you trade ideas, they explain them too.
News feeds are delivered along with the other information for a specified ticker symbol. These feeds pull financial news and broader topics from Reuters, Eikon, IFR and others. The news feeds are active around the clock and provide accurate, authoritative content to confirm or refine your trading ideas.
13
With uninvested cash earning 0.01%, and no banking features like ATM access available, tastytrade's cash management offering is among the weakest in the industry. While there is no minimum to open a margin account, you must have at least $2,000 in your account to gain margin privileges, and begin trading on margin.

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024.
We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories:

Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.
Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top online brokers and trading platforms.

high-yield savings accounts reviews and performance,How to Find and Open a High-Yield Savings Account,Learn how to maximize your earnings on cash saved for an emergency fund or a special goal by finding and opening a high-yield savings account that's right for you.,https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-open-a-high-yield-savings-account-4770631,"To find and open a high-yield savings account that's right for you, start with some research regarding rates, terms, and account features. Check our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings account rates to get a head start. Then, opening a new account is usually an easy process that can be completed online or in person at a bank or credit union.
Below, you'll find featured savings and cash management accounts—from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks—available from our partners, followed by information on how to find the highest savings account rates nationwide.

Hundreds of savings accounts at banks and credit unions are accessible via the internet. If you hope to beat inflation, you may need to move funds into a high-yield savings account outside your primary bank. There's no limit to the number of checking and savings accounts you can have at multiple banks.

That said, you may already bank at a top-paying institution. So, check what you can earn in a savings account at your existing bank or credit union. Then, review the top national high-yield savings account rates.
Many of the top rates are offered by online banks. Internet-only banks don't carry the overhead costs of physical branches and often pay the most competitive deposit rates in the country. However, many brick-and-mortar institutions now offer separately-branded online banks with competitive rates.

When shopping for rates, be sure to read the fine print regarding:
After identifying rates of the top-paying savings accounts, it's time to figure out the right choice for you. If you find your existing bank's savings rate competitive and worthwhile, open a new account with your current bank. You'll enjoy the convenience of a single bank login, instantaneous transfers between checking and savings accounts, and a streamlined signup process.
But if you're like most rate shoppers, you'll find that you can earn more by opening a savings account at a new institution. Top national rates are often 10 to 12 times higher than the national average rate.

If a top rate is from a credit union, ensure you qualify. Banking at a credit union requires you to first become a member of that institution. Any credit union appearing on Investopedia's ranking of the top savings accounts accepts members nationwide, although some may require a small membership fee in the form of a charitable donation.

Review any fees that may be associated with the institution's account. Common bank fees include:
You may also want to research the institution by reviewing complaints regarding high-yield savings accounts in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Complaint Database. However, there are very few complaints—only 53 out of over 5 million complaints total—as the CFPB has taken action against companies that misrepresented high-yield savings accounts.

Once you've selected your new high-yield savings account institution, complete the required application, likely online. In most cases, it should only take 10 minutes or so.
You will need to provide the institution with your:

You'll also need to decide whether to open this account as a single individual or jointly with another person, such as your spouse. If you opt for a joint account, provide all of the second applicant's information, as well.
You can visit a branch if you're opening an account at a physical bank in your community. But even with local institutions, you can likely open an account online. This saves you a trip to the branch and makes for a faster process than in-person with a banker.
Some institutions require you to set up an electronic transfer of funds from an outside account into your new account. You may be asked to do so immediately to fund the minimum initial deposit, while others allow you some time, and others don't have minimum deposit requirements.
Ways to fund a new savings account include:
Funding your new account from an existing bank account usually requires you to provide the institution's routing and account numbers. The online application may also ask for your bank's login credentials to instantly verify the account.
If not, your new account may send two trial deposits to the account you're linking, which you'll use for account verification over the next few days.
Once you've opened your new account, it's typically wise to enroll in online banking. You may be able to do this right away after completing your online application. For some banks and credit unions, you may have to wait a few days until you get an email or letter with the account information for online enrollment.
As you set up online banking, note your username and password in a secure physical place or with password storage software. Then, set up the bank's app on your smartphone or tablet. Bank apps are free for customers. Within the app, you'll need to log in with your username and password to interact with your accounts.
Unless you already did this during the application process, log in to your account and designate one or more beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are those you name to inherit your account balance should something happen to you.
Almost all accounts allow for establishing a primary beneficiary. Many also accommodate secondary beneficiaries, who inherit the account balance if the primary beneficiary isn't alive.
A typical scenario is to designate your spouse as the primary beneficiary (if they are not jointly named on the account) and your children as secondary beneficiaries. But your beneficiary choices are up to you and your situation.
Review your choices for account alert options. You might want to get alerts regarding deposits or withdrawals over a certain amount or if your account balance drops below a designated amount. You can often choose whether activity alerts are sent by email, text, or notifications from the app.
Also, consider whether you want electronic account statements. E-statements may offer more secure protection against identity theft, and some online-only banks may require opting into e-statements—or charge a monthly fee if you request paper statements.
If you set up a transfer for the initial deposit, you likely linked an external bank account to your new high-yield savings account. But with most accounts, you can link multiple external bank accounts. This can be useful if you bank at multiple institutions or often transfer funds to your children's accounts.
Start the account linking process immediately so it's ready when you need it; the setup can take a few days.
Lastly, understand all of your account's rules and requirements to avoid future fees. Fees could quickly eat into any interest returns.
While some accounts have no monthly fees, others do have such fees. But there are usually specific actions you can take to avoid them. These actions could include:
High-yield savings accounts can be great for accumulating money for future purchases or emergencies, and they're usually quick and easy to open. Some of these financial institutions might also offer high-yield checking accounts. Typically, you'll find that your primary banking institution doesn't offer the best rates, so opening a new account at a different institution can be smart. Online-only banks tend to offer the best rates, although this isn't always true. You'll earn much more than a typical savings account, but keep an eye on fees that might eat up that interest."
