Snowball debt payoff method effectiveness,How to Choose a Debt Payoff App,Debt payoff apps can help organize your debts and provide advice for repayment. Learn more about choosing the right debt payoff app for your situation.,https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-choose-a-debt-payoff-app-8548983,"Debt payoff apps can help you organize your debts and formulate an effective repayment plan. These apps come with various structures, features, and prices to suit many financial situations. With a bit of effort, you can find something that works for you.
There’s a variety of debt payoff apps and services. Some are designed to help you with budgeting, while others help you stay on track with bills or even consolidate debt.
If you need help organizing your debts and budgeting for repayment, a bill organizer or budget planner app like undebt.it may be a wise choice. These apps generally let you add your debts to one account, select a repayment option based on your needs and preferences, and offer advice on prioritizing your bills. Essentially, they tell you to put more money toward specific debts.
With undebt.it, for example, you can choose from eight different debt payoff plans, including the popular debt snowball and debt avalanche methods, and track how you’re progressing toward full repayment.1
A debt reduction spreadsheet isn’t necessarily an app, but it can help you accomplish the same goals—understanding your debts and repaying them. While you could create a debt reduction spreadsheet on your own, doing so may be complicated and time-consuming unless you’re skilled with Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
Fortunately, companies like Vertex42 offer pre-made debt reduction spreadsheets to help you organize and prioritize your bills, and formulate a plan for debt repayment. The basic version of Vertex42’s debt reduction sheet is free and lets you choose from multiple repayment options, including the basics along with stair-stepper and custom strategies.2 It could be a good solution for someone with a handful of payments to manage. 
Consolidating your debt—i.e., using one loan or credit line to repay multiple debts—often makes it easier to manage your payments and may also reduce your interest costs. For instance, if you have four high-rate credit cards and juggling payments is difficult, consolidating them could make those debts more manageable. If you consolidate at a lower rate (or a lower average rate), you can save money overall, as well.
Certain apps, like Tally, offer debt consolidation for eligible users in addition to debt management guidance. Tally not only helps reduce your debt burden but also helps you formulate a plan for repayment and track your progress.4 This combination can be useful for someone struggling to manage high-rate debt and several monthly payments.
Automated bill payment apps like Bright Money are another solution that could help with debt repayment. With these apps you can track and manage your bill payments in one place, helping you stay organized and reducing the likelihood that you’ll pay late or miss a payment entirely. 
For example, Bright Money analyzes your financial situation and credit card debts and helps you determine how much to pay toward each card (at least the minimum due). It then makes your payments for you according to your specific financial goals. When you progress toward repayment or improve your credit score, Bright Money sends you encouraging notifications that can help you stay motivated.5
Just as many debt payoff apps exist, so too are there many debt payoff strategies. Here are some popular strategies debt payoff apps may offer. 
The debt avalanche method focuses on prioritizing your highest interest rate debt first, with the goal of minimizing your total interest charges and saving the most money. With the debt avalanche, you make the minimum monthly payments on all your debts and use any money left over toward your highest-rate debt. 
Depending on your balances, it can take longer to see progress with the debt avalanche method, so it’s not for everyone. But if you want to prioritize your high-rate debts and keep more money in your pocket, this could be the perfect option.
The debt snowball method focuses on quick wins in debt repayment. With this method, you prioritize your smallest debts first, making minimum payments toward your other debts. Once you’ve fully repaid the smallest debt, you switch focus to the next-smallest, and so on. 
As with the debt avalanche method, the debt snowball isn’t right for everyone. But it could be ideal if repaying small debts fairly quickly will keep you motivated. 
“Amounts owed” is a key factor in your credit score, accounting for 30% of your total FICO score.6 Focusing on your highest credit utilization first is a good way to reduce the amount you owe and potentially improve your credit score over time. In practice, this usually means focusing on the credit card with the least available credit.
While prioritizing your highest credit utilization first might not save you as much money as focusing on your highest-rate debt first, it’s a wise move if your primary goal is to build credit. 
The stair-stepper, as explained by the Vertex42 tool, is a combination of the debt avalanche and the debt snowball that could be good for someone with many debts. You begin by grouping your debts according to balance, such as $0–$3,000, $3,001–$6,000, etc. Then, starting with the lowest group, you pay off the balances with the highest interest rate first. Then you move on to the next-smallest group of balances, and so on.2
If none of the above payoff plans sound like the best solution, you can also create a custom payoff plan that better meets your needs. For instance, you might prioritize a specific type of debt, like student loans, as doing so could help you feel unburdened. Some debt payoff apps allow you to create custom plans like this.
Consolidating debt involves combining multiple debt accounts into one, reducing the number of monthly payments you have to make. You do this by getting a new loan or credit line and then using it to repay multiple existing balances. In some cases, the lender may pay off those balances directly, without sending the money to you. The primary goal of debt consolidation is to make it easier to manage and track your payments, although you may also be able to reduce your interest rate.
Refinancing debt means replacing an existing loan or credit line with a new one at a lower interest rate, or with an extended term that results in more manageable monthly payments. Take note, however, that if you refinance with a longer term you will likely end up paying more overall than you otherwise would have.
The right debt payoff app combined with the right attitude could help you formulate a debt repayment plan and stick to it. Fortunately, several types of debt payoff apps and strategies are available, so there’s likely a solution that will align with your situation and goals. Compare app costs, features, integrations, and other details. Doing so will help you choose the best possible solution and stay motivated as you tackle your debt.  "
Snowball debt payoff method effectiveness,Best Debt Reduction Software Programs for 2024,High levels of debt are a problem for many households. These debt reduction programs and apps help people craft a plan to dig their way out of debt once and for all.,https://www.investopedia.com/best-debt-reduction-software-4844305,"While debt reduction software programs cannot make your debts disappear on their own, they can help you create a thoughtful plan to pay things down faster or create more interest savings over time. Debt reduction programs can also help you create a formal debt snowball or debt avalanche plan, then track your results. In addition to helping with budgeting, some software programs will automatically make payments to better ensure you stay on schedule.
By the end of 2022, Americans carried $986 billion in revolving credit card debt.
1
 This illustrates how much Americans rely on credit cards and why debt reduction software can be a good tool to rein in that debt.
We compared more than 20 debt reduction software programs and apps to find the best options for different types of consumers. This ranking of seven represents the best options available today based on function, price, ease of use, and more.

(with Quicken)
Quicken is our best overall because this company has been around since 1982.
2
 While you won’t find a free version available, the annual cost is reasonable when you consider the access you receive to this software and the mobile app.
Quicken is a company that offers comprehensive financial tracking software with a debt reduction component. This money management tool lets you see your entire financial life in one place, including your bank accounts, investments, loans, and other financial details. You can oversee and pay your bills using the interface with some plans, which are available for Windows or Mac. You can also create a debt reduction plan and oversee all your spending with tools that let you search for transactions and determine where your money is really going.
Quicken was founded in 1982, and over 20 million people have used its software.

 This company has 256-bit encryption that protects your data, and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee period.
5
The most affordable option is Quicken Starter which costs $41.88 per year. However, this option lacks some debt reduction features that could be very useful for readers of this article and is also restricted to Windows. For a mobile-focused experience, Quicken offers Simplifi for $47.88. From there, you can upgrade to the popular “Deluxe” version for $59.88 per year. This plan allows you to create a budget and track your debt, so it’s likely the best for someone seeking debt reduction help. The next plan up is the “Premier” version for $83.88 per year, which includes some real estate and investment features. There is also a version called ""Home & Business"" which is the most complete version and costs $119.88 per year. Quicken frequently offers a discount so your first year will likely cost less.

(with ZilchWorks)
ZilchWorks focuses on creating the fastest path for anyone to get out of debt, mostly because they use the debt avalanche or debt snowball method, depending on your needs. While this software isn’t intended to oversee your full financial picture, its promise is simply to help you relieve debt in the least amount of time.
ZilchWorks is ideal for consumers who want software that focuses on debt reduction. Their program works diligently to analyze your debts and figure out the fastest and most efficient way to pay them off. Once you create a plan with ZilchWorks, you will know exactly how much you need to pay each month toward each debt, and it will tell you when you’ll be debt-free.
An interesting fact about Zilchworks is that you only have to purchase this software once. This makes it less expensive for the long haul than some other debt reduction software programs that require a paid annual membership. A standard program for a single user starts at $39.95. ZilchWorks has also been around since 1990.
6
We like the fact that ZilchWorks creates an efficient debt payoff plan for you based on either the debt avalanche or debt snowball methods—the choice is yours to pay off the highest debt or the highest rates first. It’s important to note that you do have to enter your debt payments manually into this software. Also, note that Zilchworks doesn’t have its own mobile app, so you’ll need to use desktop software which is only for Windows.

(with Tally)
Tally made our list as the best debt reduction app because it incorporates debt reduction with consolidation all from a smart device. The app specifically makes it easy to manage your credit cards and bills in one place, and that includes the new line of credit Tally provides. We also like that Tally will pay your credit card bills on your behalf if you want, creating the ultimate hands-off debt repayment process.
Tally is an automated debt manager. This mobile app helps consumers by offering a line of credit at a lower interest rate than they’re paying on their credit cards. From there, Tally monitors each credit card and its balance and then uses its smart technology to help you know which cards to pay off first. Generally speaking, Tally operates using the debt avalanche method, meaning you would pay off credit card balances with the highest APRs first.
Tally is free to download. You can apply for the app's Tally+ feature which includes a credit line to consolidate your debts. This carries a fee of $0 to $300 per year. The company also makes money by charging you interest on your line of credit, which should be lower than the interest you were paying on a credit card. The service typically requires a credit score of at least 660.
7
While this app promises to automate debt repayment for you, it does offer the option to let you pay your credit card bills yourself. Tally also promises the safe transfer of your data, which is transmitted securely using a 256-bit encryption.
(with Unbury.Me)
While Unbury.Me is incredibly basic, it’s totally free to use. We also believe it’s a helpful tool for consumers who want help creating a debt payoff plan without having to deal with complicated software or syncing their bank accounts.
If you really just want access to a free tool that can help you create a debt repayment plan you can manage yourself, Unbury.Me is a good option. This software includes a basic debt repayment calculator you can use to craft a payoff plan using the debt snowball or the debt avalanche, two different strategies that have you focus on the smallest debts or debts with the highest interest rate first.
Interestingly, you don’t download this software to your computer. Instead, you create an online account where you can store your information. Then, each time you want to tweak or update your debt information, you sign on and make the changes manually. The app does not sync with your banking and other accounts.
Even though there are a lot of limitations with this debt reduction software, it is effective in helping you see the big picture and determine whether to use the debt snowball or debt avalanche method. For someone disciplined to follow a set plan, Unbury.Me might be all they need.
(with Qube Money)
Qube Money helps you manage all aspects of your finances and is the only debt reduction software that made our list for envelope budgeting. If you want to pay down debt and start using a budget that works, consider giving it a try.
Qube Money is a comprehensive financial management tool that lets you plan your finances using the “envelope budgeting method.” This method of budgeting forces you to set spending limits in all discretionary categories including groceries, dining out, entertainment, transportation, and more. From there, Qube Money sets up digital envelopes that work in conjunction with a Qube Money debit card tied to your account. The app tracks your spending and other family members’ spending who are synced to the program, letting you work within parameters and stay on track. 
Qube Money is also rolling out automated debt reduction, which will help you manage your credit card bills and other debts in an optimized way. With the Qube Money budgeting help that you receive, you’ll also be in the best position possible to “find” extra money you were wasting before and can use to pay down debt faster. 
Qube Money offers a ""free"" Basic version, which has a one-time fee of $5. There is also the Premium version for $79 per year and the Family version for $149 per year. You can also choose to pay monthly, but this will cost you more over the course of a year. Their default security system also requires you to open a “qube” using your mobile app before you can spend money with your Qube debit card, making the system foolproof and secure. You can also apply for Qube Kid cards that let your little ones learn about and be part of the family finances. 
(with Undebt.it)
The Undebt.it debt snowball calculator uses a streamlined interface to create a savvy debt repayment plan for free. The snowball method pays off your smallest debts first. If the snowball is not to your liking, there are other repayment strategies as well.
Undebt.it is a free debt reduction calculator you can use on any desktop computer or mobile device. This calculator helps you use the debt snowball method, which asks you to pay off your smallest debts first while making minimum payments on the rest. While the program focuses on the debt snowball, you can choose from other methods if it doesn't suit your situation. Founded in 2012, Undebt.it claims to have users currently paying down billions of debt.

9
Creating an account is entirely free, but you do have to enter all your individual debts and accounts manually. From there, Undebt.it will help you craft a debt payoff plan using the debt snowball method, or via seven other methods if you prefer, including the debt avalanche. You can also use “Debt Snowflakes” to tack on additional payments to specific bills, and you can track your credit utilization, spending, and debt payoff plan all in one place.
Undebt.it is a secure option to consider if you want a debt reduction program that doesn’t require you to enter your banking information or passwords. For anyone concerned with identity theft or compromised information, this is a bonus even though it does limit the features available.
Quicken is a well-established company that was founded in 1982, and we believe this is the strongest choice for most situations. Its software works on the most popular platforms, including Mac and Windows for desktop versions and Android and iOS for mobile versions. It syncs with your bank data so you have the option to handle pretty much all of your finances through Quicken if you so choose.
To find the best debt reduction software programs, we looked for services that offer a wide range of functionality for a reasonable cost (or no cost at all). We included some programs that sync with your bank accounts and provide oversight of your complete financial picture, but we also wanted to include free tools that can help you create a path out of debt without having to link your bank accounts.
Overall, we looked for programs that have solid reviews, a history of helping people out of debt, and security features that can keep your information safe."
Snowball debt payoff method effectiveness,How Much Does Debt Relief Cost?,"Some debt relief methods come with costs of their own, which can be quite steep. Learn which options are best for you and the debt relief costs you may have to pay.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-a-debt-relief-program-cost-7371803,"Debt relief costs vary widely depending on the method—debt payoff apps are often free or inexpensive, while debt settlement and bankruptcy can cost thousands of dollars in fees.
Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt. We’ll go over the costs for five popular debt relief options: debt settlement, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt payoff apps, and bankruptcy.
Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?
2
Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.
Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.
Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:
More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:
Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.
Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.
7
Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.
8
 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:
You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.
Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.
Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.
If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.
Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:
And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:
The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 
Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.
Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.
Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.
Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.
10
After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:
Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
11
 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:
Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.
If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”
There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 
It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.
Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:
You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 
Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. "
Avalanche debt payoff method comparison,How Much Do Debt Payoff Apps Cost?,"A debt payoff app could be a valuable tool if you’re struggling financially. Some are free, but if you want advanced features you typically need to pay a small fee.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-do-debt-payoff-apps-cost-8549020,"Some debt payoff apps are free, while others offer more advanced features and charge monthly or annual fees ranging from a few bucks a month to several hundred dollars per year. 
Learn more about how much debt payoff apps cost, their functions, and other options for getting out of debt.
Debt payoff app costs vary depending on the tool you choose. Some apps are free and not-for-profit, with no ads. Others rely on in-app ads to generate revenue. Still others have a free trial, a nominal monthly subscription fee, a one-time membership fee, or additional costs associated with services like subscription management or bill negotiation. Some tools include debt consolidation/refinance loans or credit lines, which come with their own interest fees and origination fees.
For instance, the simple debt calculator unbury.me is available at no cost and has no ads, but you’ll pay up to $14.99 per month for a full-featured app like YNAB (You Need a Budget) after its 34-day free trial ends (or $99 annually, coming to $8.25 per month).
As you compare different options, consider any costs relative to the potential savings you could get from using the app consistently. If a certain app could help you repay debts you’ve struggled with for years, it could be worth paying a small fee in exchange for that relief and peace of mind. 
Here’s a look at the costs of some popular debt payoff apps.
There are several types of debt payoff apps and services, each providing a different method to achieve the same goal: getting you out of debt. Some are mobile apps or desktop apps, some are web-based, and some are downloadable spreadsheets.
If you have several types of debt and are struggling to prioritize monthly payments, a bill organizer or budget planner could be a useful solution. These apps help you organize your debts and guide you on which to pay off first. Often, they employ strategies like the debt snowball or debt avalanche methods to help you prioritize. 
One example of this type of app is Undebt.it, which has a free version and a premium version (Undebt.it+), which costs just $12 annually. The free version includes the ability to add unlimited debt accounts, support for promotional interest rates (such as introductory APR credit cards), debt payoff method comparisons, and a downloadable payoff plan. The premium version includes features like account tracking and reporting, bill management, customized debt payoff plans, and more. 
A simple spreadsheet to organize bills or create a budget may suffice for those with few debts or household expenses. If you’re skilled with spreadsheets, you could build your own customized spreadsheet using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. 
But other options, like Vertex42’s Debt Snowball Calculator, let you work from an existing template. This approach could be easier if you don’t have the time for or interest in creating your own debt reduction spreadsheet. The basic version of the Vertex42 Debt Snowball Calculator is free, and there’s an upgraded version for $9.95.
High-rate debt can be difficult to repay, as interest charges add up quickly. People struggling to keep up with multiple unsecured debts or high interest rates could benefit from a debt consolidation app. These apps typically have two components: a low-rate loan or credit line that lets you consolidate and refinance existing high-rate debt, and tools or guidance that help you better understand and manage debt. 
If you’re able to refinance at a lower rate, you may save money compared to your previous debt accounts (just watch out for origination and other fees). If you consolidate multiple debts into a single loan or credit line, you can simplify your payment schedule. And, if you wind up with a longer payment timeline, you may have lower monthly payments—but you’d also end up paying more for the debt over time.
Tally is a typical example of a debt consolidation app. The basic, free version doesn’t come with any consolidation tools, but the premium version offers a low-interest credit line to eligible users. The premium version of Tally is $300 annually; the company claims that most users save more than that by using the app.
An automated bill payment app can help if you’re having trouble keeping track of your monthly bills. These apps automatically pay your bills on their due dates, providing you with the assurance that your bills like credit cards and loans will be paid on time. 
Bright Money is one option for automating your monthly bills. It lets you easily track and manage all your credit card and loan accounts under one umbrella, automating payments but also alerting you when a payment is due. You can choose from a few membership plans, depending on how long you want to use the service:
A debt payoff app could be a good solution for many people, including those with just a few debts, those with many debts, or those seeking assistance with managing their finances in general. Here are some pros and cons of using debt payoff apps.
Debt payoff apps can also be used alongside other debt relief options, including the following. Note that some are more expensive than others and could affect your credit. 
You don’t need to solve your debt problem alone—the right debt payoff app will make the process much simpler and give you a timeline to track your progress, which can be encouraging. And with the wide variety of apps available, you should be able to find one to suit your unique financial needs."

There’s a variety of debt payoff apps and services. Some are designed to help you with budgeting, while others help you stay on track with bills or even consolidate debt.
If you need help organizing your debts and budgeting for repayment, a bill organizer or budget planner app like undebt.it may be a wise choice. These apps generally let you add your debts to one account, select a repayment option based on your needs and preferences, and offer advice on prioritizing your bills. Essentially, they tell you to put more money toward specific debts.
With undebt.it, for example, you can choose from eight different debt payoff plans, including the popular debt snowball and debt avalanche methods, and track how you’re progressing toward full repayment.

A debt reduction spreadsheet isn’t necessarily an app, but it can help you accomplish the same goals—understanding your debts and repaying them. While you could create a debt reduction spreadsheet on your own, doing so may be complicated and time-consuming unless you’re skilled with Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
Fortunately, companies like Vertex42 offer pre-made debt reduction spreadsheets to help you organize and prioritize your bills, and formulate a plan for debt repayment. The basic version of Vertex42’s debt reduction sheet is free and lets you choose from multiple repayment options, including the basics along with stair-stepper and custom strategies.

 It could be a good solution for someone with a handful of payments to manage. 
Consolidating your debt—i.e., using one loan or credit line to repay multiple debts—often makes it easier to manage your payments and may also reduce your interest costs. For instance, if you have four high-rate credit cards and juggling payments is difficult, consolidating them could make those debts more manageable. If you consolidate at a lower rate (or a lower average rate), you can save money overall, as well.
Certain apps, like Tally, offer debt consolidation for eligible users in addition to debt management guidance. Tally not only helps reduce your debt burden but also helps you formulate a plan for repayment and track your progress.

 This combination can be useful for someone struggling to manage high-rate debt and several monthly payments.
Automated bill payment apps like Bright Money are another solution that could help with debt repayment. With these apps you can track and manage your bill payments in one place, helping you stay organized and reducing the likelihood that you’ll pay late or miss a payment entirely. 
For example, Bright Money analyzes your financial situation and credit card debts and helps you determine how much to pay toward each card (at least the minimum due). It then makes your payments for you according to your specific financial goals. When you progress toward repayment or improve your credit score, Bright Money sends you encouraging notifications that can help you stay motivated.

Just as many debt payoff apps exist, so too are there many debt payoff strategies. Here are some popular strategies debt payoff apps may offer. 
The debt avalanche method focuses on prioritizing your highest interest rate debt first, with the goal of minimizing your total interest charges and saving the most money. With the debt avalanche, you make the minimum monthly payments on all your debts and use any money left over toward your highest-rate debt. 
Depending on your balances, it can take longer to see progress with the debt avalanche method, so it’s not for everyone. But if you want to prioritize your high-rate debts and keep more money in your pocket, this could be the perfect option.
The debt snowball method focuses on quick wins in debt repayment. With this method, you prioritize your smallest debts first, making minimum payments toward your other debts. Once you’ve fully repaid the smallest debt, you switch focus to the next-smallest, and so on. 
As with the debt avalanche method, the debt snowball isn’t right for everyone. But it could be ideal if repaying small debts fairly quickly will keep you motivated. 
“Amounts owed” is a key factor in your credit score, accounting for 30% of your total FICO score.

 Focusing on your highest credit utilization first is a good way to reduce the amount you owe and potentially improve your credit score over time. In practice, this usually means focusing on the credit card with the least available credit.
While prioritizing your highest credit utilization first might not save you as much money as focusing on your highest-rate debt first, it’s a wise move if your primary goal is to build credit. 
The stair-stepper, as explained by the Vertex42 tool, is a combination of the debt avalanche and the debt snowball that could be good for someone with many debts. You begin by grouping your debts according to balance, such as $0–$3,000, $3,001–$6,000, etc. Then, starting with the lowest group, you pay off the balances with the highest interest rate first. Then you move on to the next-smallest group of balances, and so on.
2
If none of the above payoff plans sound like the best solution, you can also create a custom payoff plan that better meets your needs. For instance, you might prioritize a specific type of debt, like student loans, as doing so could help you feel unburdened. Some debt payoff apps allow you to create custom plans like this.
Consolidating debt involves combining multiple debt accounts into one, reducing the number of monthly payments you have to make. You do this by getting a new loan or credit line and then using it to repay multiple existing balances. In some cases, the lender may pay off those balances directly, without sending the money to you. The primary goal of debt consolidation is to make it easier to manage and track your payments, although you may also be able to reduce your interest rate.
Refinancing debt means replacing an existing loan or credit line with a new one at a lower interest rate, or with an extended term that results in more manageable monthly payments. Take note, however, that if you refinance with a longer term you will likely end up paying more overall than you otherwise would have.
The right debt payoff app combined with the right attitude could help you formulate a debt repayment plan and stick to it. Fortunately, several types of debt payoff apps and strategies are available, so there’s likely a solution that will align with your situation and goals. Compare app costs, features, integrations, and other details. Doing so will help you choose the best possible solution and stay motivated as you tackle your debt.  "
personalized debt payoff plan best practices,How to Get Debt Relief in 2024,You have many options for debt relief. Learn what you need to know and how to get each one so you can get started on your debt payoff journey.,https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-get-debt-relief-7514809,"You can get debt relief through a variety of methods—your main options are consolidation loans and balance transfer credit cards, debt payoff apps, credit counseling services, debt settlement, and bankruptcy.

Consolidation loans and balance transfer credit cards are relatively simple to get, just like applying for any other loan or credit card. Debt payoff apps and services can easily be downloaded from app stores or accessed through websites. Credit counseling and debt settlement companies, however, are more involved—they require consultations and program enrollment. And while it's possible to file for bankruptcy on your own, working with an attorney can ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible.

Personal loans for debt consolidation generally offer interest rates that are fixed, and lower than credit cards. This means your payment won’t change from month to month, and if you refinance at a lower rate you can save money overall. Taking out a longer-term loan can make your payments more manageable, but be mindful that this can ramp up the total amount of interest you pay over time, as well. Many personal loans come with one- to five-year term lengths, but some may be available for 10 years or even longer.
Moving debt from a credit card to a personal loan can increase your credit score, because revolving debts like credit cards are penalized more heavily by credit-scoring models than installment debts like personal loans.
1
 But if you’re going to pay off credit cards with a personal loan, commit to paying off your credit cards in full each month to avoid running up a large balance again and getting into more debt. If you have trouble controlling your spending, you should be careful with debt consolidation strategies.
Personal loans may also come with origination fees, which (when charged) are often around 1% to 9% of your loan amount. Another downside is how your current debt may limit the usefulness of this strategy; to qualify for the best rates, you’ll typically need good credit. However, having a lot of debt—especially credit card debt—can lower your credit score, sometimes making it tough to get approved for better rates on a personal loan (unless you can apply with a creditworthy co-signer).
Another debt consolidation/refinance option is to open a 0% APR balance transfer credit card. These are credit cards that offer an introductory period with no interest on debt that you transfer over, typically 12 to 21 months (in some cases, current cardholders may get 0% offers, as well). During this period, 100% of any payments you make will go directly toward reducing your original balance, with none spent on interest, making this a good time to ramp up your extra payments, if you can. 
Although some card issuers only allow you to use their balance transfer cards for credit card debt, others may allow you to transfer personal loan debt, auto loan debt, business loan debt, and more.
After the intro period ends, the interest rate will go back up to its regular level—that means any remaining balance will start accruing interest, usually at a pretty high rate. Some people with large credit card balances “surf” between balance transfer cards, opening a new one as soon as the intro period expires. However, this strategy can be limiting since you usually can’t transfer over debt from within the same company. You can’t use a Discover balance transfer card to consolidate debt from other Discover cards, for example.
You’ll typically have a brief period of 45 to 60 days after opening your new card to complete the transfer; after that, you lose the intro 0% offer. You’ll also usually need to pay a balance transfer fee, which isn’t insubstantial; it's often around 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
There are dozens of browser-based online tools and mobile apps that help you get debt relief using various strategies to pay down your debt faster. Some apps, such as Chip and Changed, allow you to round up purchases that you make with your debit or credit cards to the nearest dollar, periodically sending that cash in as an extra payment to help you pay down your debt quicker.
Other services like Undebt.it and Unbury.me allow you to input or link your debt accounts to organize and create a custom debt payoff plan, sometimes with automated payments as well. They usually encourage you to use a debt payoff strategy like the snowball or avalanche method. These programs can help motivate you to stick with a plan and/or make extra payments toward your debt by showing you exactly how much money you’ll save, and how much sooner you’ll be out of debt.
Many of these apps are free, or use a freemium-based model where extra features require a nominal subscription fee. 
Credit counselors offer tailored education and support for your specific situation. They might help you create a budget, check your credit and teach you how to improve it, or explore options to help you reach your financial goals. These consultation services are often free, although you’ll usually pay certain costs if you enroll in a debt management plan (DMP); this is the main way credit counselors can help lower your debt payments.
2
If you agree to a DMP, your counselor will attempt to negotiate lower interest rates with your creditors and set up a payment plan to pay off all of your debt, at a monthly payment you can afford. Your creditors may close your credit cards at this time, which can cause your credit score to decrease, and the counseling agency may require you to refrain from opening any new credit cards until you’ve completed the plan (you may be allowed to keep one card open for emergencies).
3
 You may be required to pay a setup fee, usually $75 or less, along with a monthly fee. 
Debt settlement companies offer an attractive proposal: Hire them, and they’ll work directly with your creditors to negotiate a settlement for less than you owe, letting you off the hook far sooner and potentially saving thousands of dollars. Plus, you won’t pay any fees if they aren’t able to negotiate a settlement; what’s to lose? While these debt relief companies do legitimately help many people, unfortunately, it’s not that simple. 
To give you a bargaining chip for negotiations, debt settlement companies require you to stop making payments on the debts you enroll in the program, and instead funnel that money to a third-party savings account (which may charge a monthly fee rather than offering interest).
4
 After several months or years have passed, you’ll have defaulted on your debt and incurred many late fees—but you’ll have a pot of savings in your account that the debt settlement company will offer to your creditors in exchange for releasing you from the debt.
If your creditors accept this settlement, you’ll owe a fee of up to 30% of the debt, depending on the company (some companies charge a percentage of the enrolled debt, while others charge a percentage of the settled debt). Plus, any debt that’s forgiven will typically be counted as taxable income when you file your taxes, potentially making for an explosive tax bill as well.
5
Creditors aren’t required to accept a debt settlement, though—and if they don’t, your credit will still be damaged and you’ll be on the hook for the full debt balance, plus late fees and potentially even court costs if your lender decides to sue you for the debt.
6
Bankruptcy has a huge stigma around it, and perhaps for good reason. It’s a legal process that requires going through the court system. Many people are surprised to find out they can usually keep the things that matter to them the most, such as their home and vehicle, after bankruptcy. For many people, bankruptcy is the only option to break free from debt that they’d otherwise be carrying around for the rest of their lives. 
If you can’t afford a good bankruptcy lawyer, you may be eligible for help from free or low-cost legal aid clinics.
There are several types of bankruptcy, but Chapter 7 bankruptcy is the most common, and it’s the one that people often think of: The court will sell off assets that aren’t protected by state-specific exemptions (commonly including your home and car) in exchange for discharging eligible debts over the course of a three- to four-month process. Some people, such as high-income earners and those with homes vulnerable to foreclosure, opt for Chapter 13 bankruptcy instead, which discharges eligible debts at the end of a three- to five-year court-ordered repayment plan.

Unfortunately, there are many predators looking to exploit people in desperate financial situations. Here are some tips on how to avoid debt relief scams:
You don’t always need to sign up for a formal product or plan to get help with your debt. And even if you do, it’s a good idea to consider other debt relief strategies that can boost your efforts and help you become debt-free even sooner.
You don’t have to be stuck in debt. We’ve explored many options for how to get debt relief, but no matter which one you choose, it’s best to lay some groundwork before you begin. 
“The first step in getting out of debt is to lock your credit cards and stop taking out new debt. Then you need to get on a budget,” says Zigmont. “It doesn’t matter what budget or app you use, what’s important is to find the one that works for you.” Only then will these other methods, such as credit counseling or bankruptcy, help you find success in staying debt-free in the long run.

budgeting for extra debt payments strategies,How Extra Payments Affect Future Personal Loan Payments,"Making small extra monthly payments to your principal loan amount can accelerate your loan term, lowering the amount you spend on interest. Here's how to pay off debt faster.",https://www.investopedia.com/extra-payments-affect-future-personal-loan-payments-7973996,"Making extra payments toward a personal loan, whether monthly or whenever you can, helps you save money in interest and pay off the loan faster.
When you make extra payments, you reduce the loan's principal—or the outstanding balance. Paying extra can also lower your future monthly payment amount if you have a variable payment schedule like a line of credit. However, be aware of lenders charging prepayment penalties for repaying a loan earlier. Discover how extra payments can affect your future loan payments and financial outlook.
One of the biggest advantages of making extra payments on your personal loan is that you can save money.
When your extra payments reduce your principal, you also reduce the amount of total interest you're charged (based on the principal).
1
In addition, extra payments shorten the length of time you're in debt. If you want to get out of debt faster, extra payments can reduce the time it takes to pay down the debt. When you have your loan paid off, you can put the money you were using to make extra payments toward paying down other debt or other financial goals like saving for retirement.
You can use a personal loan calculator to determine potential savings and to compare different extra payment amounts.
When considering whether to put extra money toward paying down your personal loan early, consider the possible downsides.
Check whether your lender charges a prepayment penalty if you pay off the loan sooner than the original loan term. Some lenders charge a fee when you don't keep the loan until the end of the term. Then, use a loan calculator to check whether the amount you would save in interest by making extra payments would offset the prepayment penalty. You might find that it's worth paying the penalty to be out of debt sooner, especially if you would still have interest savings left afterward.
2
Another consideration is how long a personal loan stays on your credit if you make extra payments. Monthly payments are reported to credit bureaus, which can help your credit score. Additionally, keeping the loan can contribute to a longer credit history. In fact, in some cases, your credit score might drop after you pay off a loan.
3
 However, generally paying down your debt is more beneficial to your credit history than paying a loan reliably for a few months longer.
4
Finally, think about how the extra payments might impact your personal finances. If putting extra money toward a loan means you cannot pay other bills, this strategy can do more harm than good. Or, you could put the extra money toward an investment that could earn you more than you would save in interest by making additional payments.
You could also use extra money to build an emergency fund, which can ensure you can afford an unexpected major expense, such as a hospital bill or car repair bill.
5
If you want to pay off your personal loan early, you can take specific steps to make the debt repayment more manageable. These include:
Using a personal loan calculator can help you get a sense of how much you could save over the life of the loan—and how quickly you can pay it off—by making extra payments.
For example, let's say you have a $10,000 loan with a term of seven years at a 15% interest rate. Your monthly payment would be $192.97. The total interest you'd pay on that loan would be $6,209.27.
If you want to pay off the loan faster, you could put an extra $100 toward the loan each month. With this plan, you could be out of debt in a little less than four years and save more than $3,000 in interest. With these extra payments, you'd be saving money in interest and be out of debt faster.
A personal loan results in interest payments and can cost you more money over time. Paying down your debt faster can save you hundreds of dollars in interest while reducing your time in debt. However, before you devote a large portion of your budget toward making extra payments, make sure you have sufficient financial resources and a plan for reaching your other financial goals."
budgeting for extra debt payments strategies,How to Consolidate Debt With Bad Credit: Strategies and Options ,"Consolidating debt when you have bad credit is not impossible. Solutions include debt consolidation loans, balance transfer credit cards, and home equity loans. Alternatives such as credit counseling or a debt management plan also are available.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-consolidate-debt-with-bad-credit-strategies-and-options-8557822,"When high-interest bills start to pile up, finding a way out may seem overwhelming, especially if your credit is not so great. The good news is that there are debt consolidation options available to you, even if you have bad credit. Interest rates are usually higher than for those with better credit scores but there can still be cost-saving opportunities available. Uncovering these opportunities involves knowing your credit score, shopping around, and comparing debt consolidation options with credit card balance transfer offers, personal loans, and, if you're a homeowner, home equity loans. Read on for how to consolidate debt with bad credit and get your bills under control. 

Before embarking on any debt consolidation method, it's important to assess your credit score and credit history to see where you stand. Lenders use your credit score and history to evaluate how risky it is to loan you money. The higher your credit score, the better.

If you have bad credit, you could still be eligible for certain debt consolidation options, but the interest rate and other terms may not be as favorable. That being said, the terms could still be better than what you currently have with your various creditors. 

You can review your credit history by obtaining a free copy of your credit report from the three major credit reporting agencies at AnnualCreditReport.com. If there are errors, you can request they be corrected, which could improve your credit score.
1
Your credit score is not included in your credit report, so you have to request it separately. Many banks and credit card companies will provide free credit scores and they also available free of charge from other sources.
Debt consolidation is the process of combining several debts into a single debt. Options include a debt consolidation loan, transferring all of your credit card debt to a new card, or taking out a home equity loan. Having just one payment makes it easier to manage, plus you often save on interest. Consolidating debt may be harder for those with bad credit, but it is still possible.
2


Here is how each option works: 
Debt consolidation loans are typically personal loans from a bank, credit union, or online lender. The lender will provide a lump sum of money that you can use to pay off your creditors. After that, you repay the loan over a set period through monthly payments.
2


These loans have many benefits, including one monthly payment, generally lower interest rates than credit cards, and a specific time frame for paying off the loan so you know when your debt will be behind you. 

However, it could be hard to qualify for a debt consolidation loan if your credit score doesn't meet lenders' eligibility requirements. Also, even if a lender is willing to make a loan, the lower your credit score, the higher the interest rate will typically be. In addition, the lender may require a co-signer, someone who agrees to pay the loan if you cannot, in order for you to qualify. 

Even so, you could save money with a debt consolidation loan because it will most likely reduce what you pay in interest and late fees for other accounts, particularly credit cards. 

Many credit card companies offer cards that charge low or even zero interest for a period of time if you transfer the balances from your existing credit cards. This can not only consolidate your debt but reduce your interest payments and allow you to pay off your card debt faster. That is, provided you pay off the balance before the promotional rate expires and the card's regular—and likely much higher—interest rate kicks in. 

Unfortunately, if you have bad credit, it could be difficult to qualify for one of these cards. And if you do qualify, you might find it challenging to pay off the balance before the promotional rate ends. Also, if you have bad credit, you may not qualify for a credit card with a balance limit sufficient to accommodate all of your debt.
3
 So you may still have to deal with multiple accounts. 

If you own your home, you might qualify for a home equity loan to consolidate your debts, leaving you with one payment to manage.
4
 For instance, if your home is valued at $200,000 and you owe $140,000 on it, your home equity is $60,000. Typically, lenders will let you borrow up to 80% of your home equity. In addition, home equity loans often have lower interest rates than credit cards, so you could save on interest. 

Bear in mind, however, that with a home equity loan, your home serves as collateral. That means if you don't repay the loan as agreed, you could lose your home to the lender through foreclosure. 

If you're planning to apply for one of these debt consolidation methods, there are a few steps you can take to improve your likelihood of getting approved.
When shopping around for the best debt consolation solution, you'll want to take the time to compare all the loan terms and also check out the lender. 

On the surface, comparing interest rates sounds easy. You want the lowest rate, right? But it's not that simple. A loan with a low interest rate might have a longer repayment period, meaning that you'll pay more interest in total before it is finally paid off. For that reason, it's important to calculate how much interest you would pay over the life of the loan to see which option would save you the most money. 

Read and compare the exact terms of each debt consolidation solution. How long do you have to repay the loan? Are there prepayment penalties if you want to pay the balance off early? What happens if you ever have a late or missed payment? The answer to these questions can help you zero in on the best deal for you. 

When consolidating your debt, it's crucial to deal with a reputable lender or credit card company. If you aren't already familiar with a particular one, be sure to check its Better Business Bureau rating and read any customer reviews online. This could help you steer clear of companies that don't treat their customers well. 

Applying for a debt consolidation loan with bad credit is a relatively straightforward process. 

Following these steps will hopefully lead you to getting approved for a debt consolidation solution. 

Here are three lenders that offer debt consolidation loans with competitive rates for borrowers with less-than-stellar credit.
Once you have a debt consolidation plan in place, be sure to stick to it in order to pay off your debt. These tips might help:

For individuals with bad credit who may not qualify for traditional debt consolidation loans or balance transfer credit cards, there are some alternatives:

Talk with a certified credit counselor to see how you can create a realistic plan to pay off your debt. Many credit counseling agencies also offer workshops where you can learn more about managing your money.

A debt management plan is an agreement negotiated between a credit counselor and your creditors to get your bills paid off. This often includes waiving late fees, lowering interest rates, and extending the repayment period. It does not reduce how much you owe.
5
 

You can contact your creditors, explain your situation, and ask them to work with you to pay your debt. This does not require good credit, an application process, or paying any fees. Many creditors are willing to work with you by lowering interest rates, waiving late fees, or giving you more time to repay the debt. 

Consolidating debt when you have bad credit can be difficult but not impossible. You may qualify for a debt consolidation or home equity loan or a balance transfer credit card. Before you apply, it's important to clean up your credit report, research lenders, and shop around for the best solution for you. "
budgeting for extra debt payments strategies,What Is a Budget? Plus 11 Budgeting Myths Holding You Back,Budgeting involves estimating revenue and expenses over a specified future period of time. Budgets are usually established and re-evaluated on a periodic basis.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp,"A budget refers to an estimation of revenue and expenses that's made for a specified future period of time. Budgeting usually occurs on an ongoing basis, with individual budgets being re-evaluated regularly.
Budgets can be made for any entity that needs or wants to spend money, including governments and businesses, people, and households of any income level.
A budget is a microeconomic concept that reveals the trade-off made when one good is exchanged for another. In terms of the bottom line—or the end result of this trade-off—a surplus budget means profits are anticipated, a balanced budget means revenues are expected to equal expenses, and a deficit budget means expenses will exceed revenues. These principles hold true whether the budget is intended for an individual, a family, or a company.
First, let's take a quick look at the budgeting process for a corporation, and then personal budgeting.

Budgets are an integral part of running any business efficiently and effectively.
Corporate budgeting begins by establishing assumptions for the upcoming budget period. These assumptions are related to projected sales trends, cost trends, and the overall economic outlook of the market, industry, or sector. Specific factors affecting potential expenses are addressed and monitored.
The budget is published in a packet that outlines the standards and procedures used to develop it, including the assumptions about the markets, key relationships with vendors that provide discounts, and explanations of how certain calculations were made.
The sales budget is often the first to be developed, as subsequent expense budgets cannot be established without knowing future cash flows. Budgets are developed for all the different subsidiaries, divisions, and departments within an organization. For a manufacturer, a separate budget is often developed for direct materials, labor, and overhead.
All budgets get rolled up into the master budget, which also includes budgeted financial statements, forecasts of cash inflows and outflows, and an overall financing plan. At a corporation, the top management reviews the budget and submits it for approval to the board of directors.
There are two major types of budgets: static budgets and flexible budgets. A static budget remains unchanged over the life of the budget. Regardless of changes that occur during the budgeting period, all accounts and figures originally calculated remain the same.
A flexible budget has a relational value to certain variables. The dollar amounts listed on a flexible budget change based on sales levels, production levels, or other external economic factors.
Both types of budgets are useful for management. A static budget evaluates the effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides deeper insight into business operations.
Individuals and families can have budgets, too. Creating and using a budget is not just for those who need to closely monitor their cash flows from month to month because money is tight. Almost everyone can benefit from budgeting—even people with large paychecks and plenty of money in the bank may find it difficult to cover the expense of an unexpected home repair.

To manage your monthly expenses, prepare for life's unpredictable events, and afford big-ticket items without going into debt, budgeting is essential. Keeping track of how much you earn doesn't require you to be a math whiz and doesn't mean you can't buy the things you want.
What it does mean is that you can maintain control over where your money goes and enjoy greater financial confidence and success.

The specifics of budgeting will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. In most cases, though, the approach is the same no matter where you stand financially. Follow these seven steps to create your budget and adjust it as needed to reach specific financial goals.
Once you've created a budget, you may have to do some juggling, especially in the first few months. This means adjusting spending here and there so that you stay within your planned budget for income and expenses. And be sure to put it in writing: If you see it and commit to it, you'll have more incentive to stick to it.

Budgeting is a wonderful tool for managing your finances, but many people think it's not for them. It's important to become aware of budgeting myths—the erroneous logic that stops people from keeping track of their money and allocating it in ways that benefit them most. Then, you can create a budget that can help you live within your means, reach important goals, and build lasting wealth. Here are 11 budgeting myths.
Getting and keeping a handle on your monthly income and expenses allows you to make sure that your hard-earned money is being put to its highest and best purpose. For those who enjoy an income that covers all bills with money left over, a budget can help maximize savings and investments.
If one's monthly expenses typically consume the lion's share of net income, any budget should focus on identifying and classifying all the expenses that occur during the month, quarter, and year. And for people whose cash flow is tight, the budget can be crucial to identifying expenses that could be reduced or cut, and minimizing any wasteful interest being paid on credit cards or other debt.
Generally speaking, you don't need to be great at math to make and follow a budget. First of all, understanding general concepts relating to your income, spending, debt, saving, and allocating your funds are important. Then, the basic ability to add and subtract is most of what's called for. That's especially true if you're budgeting manually, with pencil and paper.
And now, thanks to budgeting software programs, math barely enters into it. You simply have to be able to follow instructions. Many of these programs are free and legitimate. Or, if you know how to use spreadsheet software, you can make your own ledger. It's as simple as creating one column for your income, another column for your expenses, and then keeping a running tab on the difference between the two.
No one's job is truly safe. If you work for a corporation, being laid off due to a difficult economy, downsizing, or a takeover always is a possibility. If you work for a small company, it could die with its owner, be bought out, or just fold.
You should always be prepared for a job loss by having at least three months' worth of living expenses in the bank. It's easier to accumulate this financial cushion if you know the amount you're bringing in and spending each month, which can be monitored with a budget.
Unemployment compensation is not a sure thing. Let's say a bad situation at work leaves you with no choice but to quit your job. Unless you can prove constructive discharge (that is, that you were virtually forced to resign), your departure will be considered voluntary, making you ineligible for unemployment insurance. Besides, the benefits may fall well short of the wages you're used to: in even the highest paying states, the average is less than $500 per week.
1
Budgeting is not synonymous with spending as little money as possible or making yourself feel guilty about every purchase. The aim of budgeting is to make sure you're able to spend on what's needed and save a little each month, ideally at least 10% of your income. At the very least, budgeting can make sure that you aren't spending more than you earn.
Unless you're on a very tight budget, you should be able to buy baseball tickets and go out to eat. Tracking your expenses does not change the amount of money you have available to spend every month. It just shows you where that money is going and allows you to make decisions about changing your spending habits.
If you don't have any major savings goals (e.g., upsizing your living situation, starting your own business), it's hard to drum up the motivation to stash away extra cash each month. However, your situation and your attitudes likely will change over time.
Let's say that you and your partner live in New York City in a small one-bedroom apartment and things are going fine for both of you until your family dynamic changes. For instance, you may have a child or an in-law who comes to stay with you indefinitely. This may mean you'll need (and want) more room to accommodate the new addition. If you don't save up for anything big, you may not be able to afford this change in your living situation down the road.
Yes, the catch-22 of student financial aid is that the more money you have, the less aid you'll be eligible for. That's enough to make anyone wonder if it isn't better to spend it all and have no savings in order to qualify for the maximum amount of grants and loans.
But that catch mainly applies to earned income. Whether you are an adult student going back to school or the parent of a student headed to college, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form (used for Stafford Loans, Perkins Loans, or Pell Grants), does not require you to report the value of your primary residence (if you own a home) or the value of your retirement accounts.

3
So if you want to save money without compromising your financial aid eligibility, you can do so by using your savings to buy a house, prepay your mortgage, or contribute more money to your retirement accounts. The savings that you put into these assets can still be accessed if you face an emergency, but you won't be penalized for it.
Even if you employ all the available legal strategies to maximize your financial aid eligibility, you still won't always qualify for as much aid as you need. So it's not a bad idea to have your own source of funds to make up for any shortfall.
Good for you! But being debt-free without any savings won't pay your bills in an emergency. A zero balance can quickly become a negative balance if you don't have a safety net. Budgeting can help you create one.
It's never a good idea to count on unpredictable sources of income. This may be the year that your company is unable to give you a raise (or as much of a raise as you hope for). The same is true of bonus money. Tax refunds are more reliable, but this depends in part on how good you are at calculating your own tax liability.
Some people know how to figure how much they'll get in a refund (or how much they will owe) as well as how to adjust this figure through changes in payroll withholding throughout the year. However, changes in tax deductions, IRS regulations, or other life events can mean a nasty surprise when you prepare your tax return.
If you're still not convinced that budgeting is for you, here's a way to protect yourself from your own spending habits. Set up an automatic transfer from your checking account to a savings account that you don't see regularly (i.e., at a different bank). Schedule the transfer to happen right after you get paid.
If you are saving for retirement, you may have the option of contributing a set amount regularly to a 401(k) or other retirement savings plan. This way, you can pay yourself first, have enough money for the transfer, and know that you can meet your savings goal. 
Sometimes budgeting just isn't a priority because you have too much on your plate. But there are certain government programs that can help you manage your household expenses. For instance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps recipients of all income levels work with their food budgets to make their benefits go further.

At the very least, set up that budget so you get a feel for spending limits, any change in how you originally planned to allocate your funds, whether you're paying all you can to get rid of debt, or whether your slipping too far into debt.
In general, traditional budgeting starts with tracking expenses, eliminating debt, and, once the budget is balanced, building an emergency fund. But to speed up the process, you could start by building a partial emergency fund.
This emergency fund acts as a buffer as the rest of the budget is put in place and should replace the use of credit cards for emergency situations.
The key is to build the fund at regular intervals, consistently devoting a certain percentage of each paycheck toward it, and if possible, putting in whatever you can spare on top. This will get you to think about your spending, too.
You should only use your emergency fund for true emergencies. For instance, if you lose your job and need to pay for expenses, you could tap into your rainy day fund until you join the workforce again. You can also use this money if you have an unexpected medical emergency that arises.
You would save money if you used your emergency fund to eliminate credit card debt, but the purpose of the fund is to prevent you from having to use your credit card for paying for unexpected expenses. With a proper emergency fund, you will not need your credit card to keep you afloat when something goes wrong.
Once you have a buffer between you and high-interest debt, you can start the process of downsizing. The more space you can create between your expenses and your income, the more income you will have to pay down debt and invest.
This can be a process of substitution as much as elimination. For example, cancel any recurring subscriptions that you don't regularly use or need. Use half of the money you save to invest for a goal or to pay off outstanding debts. Save the other half to bulk up your emergency fund.
Although eliminating expenses entirely is the fastest way to a solid budget, substitution tends to have more lasting effects. So consider:
People can sometimes cut too many expenses so that they end up with a budget that they can't stick to. Substitution, in contrast, keeps the basics while trimming costs.
Once you have your budget in place and have more money coming in than going out, you can start investing to create more income.
It is better to have no debt before you begin investing. If you are young, however, the rewards of investing in higher-risk, high-return securities like stocks can outweigh most low-interest debt over time.
You've got your budget set up. Now you've got to stick to it. But that credit card still calls your name, your clothes budget seems awfully small, and you feel deprived. At such moments, it helps to revisit the whole reason for a budget—to help you manage your finances, achieve financial goals, and lead a life free from fear of financial pitfalls.
Your budget can keep you out of overwhelming debt and help you build a financial future that will give you more freedom, not less. So think about the future you want and remember that keeping to your budget will help you get there. Adding to your debt load, on the other hand, will mean that your financial future could be less bright.
Every time you enter your spending in your software or budget notebook, review everything that's been spent to date and compare it to income received. This will keep you abreast of where things stand and encourage you to keep at it, especially if you are reining in your spending as intended. This daily or weekly activity can give you an enormous sense of accomplishment and keep you on track.
Make it more difficult to make impulse purchases. In other words, set up barriers that give you time to think: ""Is this purchase necessary?"" Opt out of retailer email lists. Remove your stored payment information on your favorite online shops so you can't just click to order. Adjust your phone settings to block tracking and advertising as much as possible.
If you feel like you're the only one in your group who is on a budget, search for some like-minded folks. You could find an online forum, a monthly meeting, or even a couple of friends who will listen to your concerns and share their budgeting experiences. Set up accountability calls with your frugal buddies to talk things over and keep temptation at bay.
Just know that you're not the only person setting sensible financial limits for yourself.
There's something powerful about handing over a stack of $20 bills for a purchase. You have to confront the money you're about to spend and accept that the spending is worth it. Swiping a debit card, on the other hand, may not feel nearly as real. 
Similarly, paying bills by writing checks and promptly entering the sums in your register keeps you up-to-date on how your account is affected in a way that autopay doesn't.
You don't have to use cash exclusively or completely forgo online payments. But handling transactions in hands-on ways can make you realize how much you're spending and enhance the power of self-regulation.
If you constantly look at what you have to give up, the very act of budgeting becomes distasteful. A mixture of long- and short-term gifts to yourself will help keep you motivated.
When you've been faithful to your budget for a month, give yourself a reward. Even small ones such as a night out with friends, a concert, or a little extra cash for spending can help.
Keep visual reminders of these rewards or the things you're saving up for. Start building associations in your brain that make sticking to your budget an enjoyable activity with happy results.
It's difficult to predict correctly how much money you'll need in every category of your budget. For instance, a new job may necessitate a wardrobe change and your existing clothing budget may not cut it. That's why it's important to conduct a regular check on how well your budget is working. It may need tweaking. This is to be expected. Just make sure that you always keep your long-term financial goals in the picture.
Learn all you can about finances, money management, and how you can best invest in yourself. Talk to your financially savvy friends and seek out real-world tips and advice from people who are doing well with their money.
The more you learn about handling money wisely and the rewards that can result from such an effort, the more concrete and acceptable the reasons for budgeting will be.
Budgeting is smart, but if you're suffering from mounting bills and a lack of funds, it may not be where your focus is. In such circumstances, consider some additional steps that you can take to gain control of your finances.
Don't be afraid to request bill extensions or payment plans from creditors. Skipping or delaying payments only worsens your debt. And late fees ding your credit score. 
Go over all your bills to see what can and should be paid first, prioritize those that are late, and then set up a payment schedule based on your paydays.
Call the bill companies to see how much you can pay now to get back on track toward a positive status. Explain that you are taking strict measures to catch up. Be forthright about the amount you can afford to pay now. Don't just promise to pay the full amount later.
Stashing 10% of your income into your savings account is daunting or impossible when you're living paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't make sense to have $100 in a savings plan if you are fending off debt collectors. Your savings can wait until you can reclaim financial stability.
To fix your finances, you need to get a handle on your outlay first. Online banking and online budgeting software can help you categorize spending so you can make adjustments. Many people find that just by looking at aggregate figures for discretionary expenses, they are spurred to reduce excessive spending.
Hopefully, your budget has given you a sense of where your money goes. Now it's time to tighten up. Start cutting back on items that you wouldn't miss. Change habits that are costing you, like letting food spoil before you can eat it. Prepare meals at home instead of going to restaurants or getting takeout.
You may be able to reduce some expenses that you shouldn't drop. For example, you might be able to lower your auto insurance premium by switching carriers.
Those ultra-high interest rates on your credit cards aren't fixed in stone. Call the card company and ask for a reduction in the annual percentage rates (APR). If you have a good payment record, your request might be approved. This won't lower your outstanding balance, but it will keep it from mushrooming as fast.
Once you've gone through these steps, monitor your progress for a few months. You can do this by writing everything you spend in a notebook, with budgeting apps on your phone, or with the software you may already use for your budget.
Ensure that every cent is accounted for. Fine-tune and adjust your spending as needed after each month. This not only can help get you out of financial trouble. It also can put the spotlight back on the importance of your budget.
For the time being, saving and investing is out. But consider ways to increase your earnings: working overtime, getting a second job, or picking up some freelance work.
A budget often conjures up images of complicated financial documents. But in reality, it's a money management tool that can be used by various entities, including governments, businesses, and individuals/households of every income level. Budgets can help prepare you to make better decisions about your money so that you can secure a brighter financial future."
