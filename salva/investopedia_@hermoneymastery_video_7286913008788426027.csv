benefits of multi-account strategy for financial management,Multi-Discipline Account Definition,A multi-discipline account is a managed investment account broken into several sub-accounts employing different investment strategies.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multidisciplineaccount.asp,"A multi-discipline account refers to a managed investment account that can be accessed by multiple investment managers with different specializations. These are composed of a number of sub-accounts—each overseen by a different fund manager with relevant expertise. Multi-discipline accounts provide investors with an efficient means to a diversified, professionally managed portfolio.
Multi-discipline accounts exist to achieve a diversified portfolio without the need to maintain multiple separately managed accounts (SMAs), which can be impractical and costly. These accounts—also called multi-style or multi-strategy accounts—allow individuals to invest their money in a single account that is divided into different asset class categories.
The minimum investment for a multi-discipline account may be as much as $150,000. Investors confer with the firm to divide their capital between different sub-accounts or sub-categories. These individual segments are accessible by different investment managers who bring different areas of expertise and investment strategies to the table. These managers are free to invest their clients' money as per their investment profiles and goals—just like they would do with individual accounts.
Although they employ a separate manager for each sub-account, multi-discipline accounts use overlay managers to oversee entire portfolios. This individual is able to guarantee that the account meets consistent asset allocation and coordinates the overall investment strategy. Having one manager oversee the entire account also streamlines performance reporting.
The main advantage of one of these accounts is the initial investment required. A conventional managed account normally requires a minimum investment of $100,000. For a multi-discipline account, this investment requirement may be as low as $10,000 and as high as $150,000, so even the average retail investor can access one.
Let's say an investor wants to divide their assets among four separate strategies—for instance, large-cap growth, large-cap value, international growth, and dividend strategy. The investor would need at least $400,000, and that assumes a plan to divide assets equally among all four strategies. Being able to commit and put down this much capital may be difficult and frustrating. Compare that to the option of a single, multi-discipline account that encompasses four sub-accounts. It requires less money to start and allows the investor to split assets asymmetrically.
Separately managed accounts have become popular among high net worth investors (HNWIs) looking for an instrument with more individual attention than comes with a mutual fund. Like a separately managed account, and unlike a mutual fund, a multi-discipline account allows investors to advantage of the specific-shares method, as each lot of shares purchased comes within an individual cost basis. A separately managed account gives an individual retail investor the benefit of customized portfolio management, something a pooled vehicle cannot offer.
But the minimum investments tend to differ between these two types of accounts. While multi-discipline accounts have a lower entry threshold, separately managed accounts may require a higher minimum investment. An HNWI may have no problem meeting the investment minimums necessary to set up multiple SMAs, but that doesn’t render the virtues of a multi-discipline account moot.
Whatever their investment minimums, multiple separately managed accounts come with the confusion inherent in chopping up a portfolio among multiple managers with no coordination. This confusion can mean having shares of the same stock in different accounts or in one account selling the stock that another account is buying. Further, with multiple SMAs, it is more of a chore to determine exactly how an investor’s portfolio is performing overall."

benefits of multi-account strategy for financial management,Enterprise Risk Management (ERM): What It Is and How It Works,"Enterprise risk management (ERM) is a holistic, top-down approach that assesses how risks affect an organization and devises plans on how to approach different risks.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprise-risk-management.asp,"Enterprise risk management (ERM) is a methodology that looks at risk management strategically from the perspective of the entire firm or organization. It is a top-down strategy that aims to identify, assess, and prepare for potential losses, dangers, hazards, and other potentials for harm that may interfere with an organization’s operations and objectives and/or lead to losses.

Enterprise risk management takes a holistic approach and calls for management-level decision making that may not necessarily make sense for an individual business unit or segment. Thus, instead of each business unit being responsible for its own risk management, firm-wide surveillance is given precedence.
It also often involves making the risk plan of action available to all stakeholders as part of an annual report. Industries as varied as aviation, construction, public health, international development, energy, finance, and insurance all have shifted to utilize ERM.
ERM, therefore, can work to minimize firm-wide risk as well as identify unique firm-wide opportunities. Communicating and coordinating between different business units are key for ERM to succeed, since the risk decision coming from top management may seem at odds with local assessments on the ground. Firms that utilize ERM will typically have a dedicated enterprise risk management team that oversees the workings of the firm.1

While ERM best practices and standards are still evolving, they have been formalized through COSO, an industry group that maintains and updates such guidance for companies and ERM professionals.
2
Modern businesses face a diverse set of risks and potential dangers. In the past, companies traditionally handled their risk exposures via each division managing its own business. Enterprise risk management calls for corporations to identify all the risks they face. It also makes management decide which risks to manage actively. As opposed to risks being siloed across a company, a company sees the bigger picture when using ERM.
ERM looks at each business unit as a “portfolio” within the firm and tries to understand how risks to individual business units interact and overlap. It is also able to identify potential risk factors that are unseen by any individual unit.
Companies have been managing risk for years. Traditional risk management has relied on each business unit evaluating and handling its own risk and then reporting back to the CEO at a later date. More recently, companies have started to recognize the need for a more holistic approach.
1
A chief risk officer (CRO), for instance, is a corporate executive position that is required from an ERM standpoint. The CRO is responsible for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating internal and external risks that impact the entire corporation.
The CRO also works to ensure that the company complies with government regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and reviews factors that could hurt investments or a company’s business units. The CRO’s mandate will be specified in conjunction with other top management along with the board of directors and other stakeholders.
The COSO enterprise risk management framework identifies eight core components that define how a company should approach creating its ERM practices.
A company’s internal environment is the atmosphere and corporate culture within the company set by its employees. This sets the precedence of what the company’s risk appetite is and what management’s philosophy is regarding incurring risk. The internal environment may be set by upper management or the board and communicated throughout an organization, though it is often reflected through the actions of all employees.
As a company determines its purpose, it must set objectives that support the mission and goals of a company. These objectives must then be aligned with a company’s risk appetite. For example, an ambitious company that has set far-reaching strategic plans must be aware that there may be internal risks or external risks associated with these lofty goals. In response, a company can align the measures to be taken with what it wants to accomplish, such as hiring additional regulatory staff for expansion areas it is currently unfamiliar with.
Positive events may have a great impact on a company. On the other hand, negative events may have detrimental outcomes on a company’s ability to continue to operate. ERM guidance recommends that companies identify important areas of the business and associated events that may have dire outcomes. These high-risk events may pose risks to operations (e.g., natural disasters that force offices to temporarily close) or strategic (e.g., government regulation outlaws the company’s primary product line).
In addition to being aware of what may happen, the ERM framework details the step of assessing risk by understanding the likelihood and financial impact of risks. This includes not only the direct risk (e.g., a natural disaster yields an office unusable) but also residual risks (e.g., employees may not feel safe returning to the office). Though difficult, the ERM framework encourages companies to consider quantifying risks by assessing the percent change of occurrence as well as the dollar impact.
A company can respond to risk in the following four ways:
Control activities are the actions taken by a company to create policies and procedures to ensure management carries out operations while mitigating risk. Control activities, often referred to as internal controls, are broken into two different types of processes:
Information systems should be able to capture data useful to management to better understand a company’s risk profile and risk management. This means not granting exceptions for departments outperforming others; all aspects of a company should be continually monitored. By extension, some of this data should be analyzed and communicated to employees if it is relevant to mitigating risk. By communicating with employees, there is more likely to be greater buy-in for processes and protection over company assets.
A company can turn to an internal committee or an external auditor to review its policies and practices. This may include reviewing what is actually performed compared with what policy documents suggest. This may also entail getting feedback, analyzing company data, and informing management of unprotected risks. In an ever-changing environment, companies must also be ready to assess their ERM environment and pivot as needed.
ERM practices will vary based on a company’s size, risk preferences, and business objectives. Below are best practices that most companies can use to implement ERM strategies.
ERM sets the organization-wide expectations around a company’s culture. This includes communicating more openly about the risks a company faces and how to mitigate them. This leads to less unexpected risks and more guided direction on how to respond to certain events.
In addition, this may lead to greater employee satisfaction knowing plans are in place to protect company resources, as well as greater customer service knowing how to respond to customers should certain risks actually occur.
ERM practices are often synthesized by a standardized risk report delivered to upper management. This report succinctly summarizes the risks a company faces, the actions being taken, and the information needed for decision making. As a result, a company may be more efficient with its time, especially considering what is delivered to upper management.
ERM may also have a company-wide positive impact on the resourcefulness of the business. ERM may eliminate redundant processes, ensure efficient use of staff, reduce theft, or increase profitability by better understanding what markets to enter into.
As a company builds out its ERM practices, it will likely consider familiar risks it has been exposed to in the past. Therefore, ERM is limited in identifying future risks that the organization is unaware of that may have more detrimental impacts. In this manner, some may consider ERM as reactive, as companies can only forecast risk based on what they have prior experience with.
ERM also relies very heavily on management estimates and inputs. This may be nearly impossible to accurately predict. For example, in the very low chance that a company forecasts the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, would a company be able to accurately calculate the fiscal impact of business closures or changes in consumer spending? ERM mitigation costs may also be difficult to assess.
ERM practices are time-intensive and therefore require the resources of the company to be successful. Though the company will benefit from protecting its assets, a company must detract time of its staff and may make capital investments to implement ERM strategies. In addition, a company may find it difficult to quantify the success of ERM, as financial risks that do not occur must simply be projected.
ERM can help devise plans for almost any type of business risk. Business risk threatens a company’s ability to survive, and these risks may be further classified into different risks discussed below. In general, ERM most commonly addresses the following types of risk:
ERM is particularly well-suited for large corporations operating in complex and diverse environments. These companies often face a bunch of risks across different business units, regions, and functions. ERM helps large corporations systematically identify, assess, and manage risks at both the operational and strategic levels.
ERM can also be specifically useful in certain industries. For example, ERM is great for financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and investment firms. These companies operate within highly regulated and volatile markets. These institutions face so many of the risks discussed above. By integrating ERM into their operations, financial institutions can strengthen risk management practices, optimize capital allocation, and enhance their resilience to economic downturns.
Last, it's worth calling out multinational corporations and global enterprises as ideal entities. These companies benefit from ERM because of their expansive operations across multiple countries and jurisdictions. These companies encounter diverse risks related to geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory compliance in varying regions. By implementing ERM frameworks, global enterprises can better track and maintain these risks, especially if their entity has higher risks in certain areas, departments, or business units.
ERM is primarily concerned with identifying, assessing, managing, and mitigating risks across an organization. On the other hand, enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools focus on integrating and optimizing core business processes. The primary purpose of ERP systems is to streamline operations across finance, manufacturing, sales, and marketing (amongst others). ERM addresses risks across various functions and departments within an organization. ERP systems are generally more specific in their scope. They tend to focus on more granular operational efficiencies instead of bigger-picture, comprehensive risks.
Implementing ERM tools requires collaboration among key stakeholders like risk managers, compliance officers, executives, and board members. These stakeholders work together to establish risk management frameworks. ERP implementations may be more geared towards collaboration among IT teams, department heads, and end-users. In addition to having a heavy part to play in operations, a primary component of ERP systems is the potentially live, interconnected play between data. For this reason, as opposed to an ERM tool, ERP systems may have a more technical demand to them.
Last, risk management strategies in ERM are designed to support long-term sustainability, protect organizational assets, and minimize potential disruptions. ERP systems align with an organization's strategic goals by improving productivity, reducing costs, and providing real-time insights into business operation opportunities. In a sense, ERM and ERP systems may counteract each other. For instance, an ERP system may signal growth and efficiency opportunities to expand in a specific new market; an ERM may signal that a new market is too great of a risk to consider.

Customer relationship management (CRM) systems are centered around managing interactions with customers and prospects. It leverages technology and processes to organize, automate, and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and support activities. The primary aim of CRM is to improve relationships with customers, streamline business processes, and increase profitability by understanding and meeting customer needs effectively.
Like an ERM, a CRM system consolidates data. However, the nature of the data is entirely different. While ERMs track and monitor risks, CRMs care most about customer data, interactions, and insights that enable the company to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. CRM implementation is crucial for sales teams, marketing departments, customer service representatives, and executives who rely on customer data to drive sales growth and improve overall business performance. Alternatively, ERMs are more useful for operational teams like risk, insurance, operations, or finance.
An ERM focuses on comprehensive risk management across all facets of an organization. This tends to be inward-looking, though it can also incorporate external market forces. A CRM, alternatively, is much more outward-facing. While it will consider current processes and resources within a company, a CRM exists to monitor what is going on outside of the company with a company's arguably most important resource (i.e. its customers).
ExxonMobil is a robust example of how ERM is implemented in a large multinational corporation operating in the oil and gas industry. ERM at ExxonMobil is a structured approach that spans all levels of the organization, aiming to identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks that could impact its business operations and overall performance. Information on ExxonMobil's ERM strategy is on the company's website.
ExxonMobil's framework integrates five core elements: organizing and aggregating risks, rigorous risk identification practices, a prioritization method, systems and processes for risk management, and comprehensive risk governance. This multi-layered approach includes defined roles and responsibilities for risk owners, functional experts, and independent verifiers. The goal is that each type of risk is actively managed and aligned with corporate requirements and processes.
3
Prior to initiating new developments, the company employs advanced data and computer modeling to assess potential environmental, socioeconomic, and health risks associated with construction and operations. Engaging with communities through public meetings and collaborating with regulators ensures transparent communication and compliance with regulatory standards, both of which can minimize risks in the future.
3
This rigorous process guided by an integrated ERM also enables ExxonMobil to implement tailored measures to prevent, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts. These different types of risks could range from changing weather patterns to sea level rise, seismic activity, or geological conditions. ExxonMobil's environmental assessments with its ERM are conducted for both offshore and onshore facilities to deploy protective measures effectively and uphold operational safety.
3
As a company makes, sells, and delivers goods to customers, it faces countless risks from numerous sources. To better plan for these risks, companies are turning to enterprise risk management, a company-wide, top-down approach to assessing risk and devising plans. The ultimate goal of ERM is to protect a company’s assets and operations while having strategies in place should certain unfortunate events occur."

high-yield savings account advantages,Apple to Launch a High-Yield Savings Account,The tech giant will team up with Goldman Sachs to allow Apple Card users to stash their cash back and other savings in the account.,https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-launch-a-high-yield-savings-account-6751274,"Apple has announced a new high-yield savings product for its Apple Card users. In the coming months, the tech giant will launch its Savings account with Goldman Sachs, allowing credit card holders to stash their Daily Cash rewards in an account with a high yield. Users will also be able to add more cash to the account through a linked bank account.
In the coming months, Apple Card users will be able to open a high-yield savings account from their iPhone and have their Daily Cash rewards deposited into it. Once they set up the account, cardholders will have their cash back automatically deposited into the Savings account, though they can switch back to having their rewards added to an Apple Cash card in their wallet.
Additionally, Apple Card users will be able to link an external bank account and transfer additional cash to their Savings account to take advantage of its high yield. The account will have no fees, no minimum upfront deposit, and no minimum balance requirement.
Apple hasn't yet specified what the annual percentage yield (APY) on the account will be but says that it will be competitive with the best rates available.

high-yield savings account advantages,Earn 6% on a Checking Account? It's Possible With These High-Yield Options,High-yield checking accounts offer an exceptionally high interest rate when you meet certain monthly requirements. And some of them are currently paying 6% or more.,https://www.investopedia.com/checking-account-high-yield-options-8363635,"It may sound too good to be true, but a handful of bank accounts currently make it possible to earn 6.00% or more—while enjoying all the conveniences of a checking account. That's more than the nation's best high-yield savings account, and as much as the top-paying 1-year CD.
There is, of course, a trade-off. To earn such an astonishing rate on a checking account, you have to jump through some transactional hoops, such as using a debit card many times a month. But if you choose an account whose requirements won't be too difficult to meet within your financial lifestyle, you can significantly boost what you earn in bank interest every month.
High-yield checking accounts operate on a simple agreement: The bank or credit union establishes a list of monthly account requirements, and whenever you meet those requirements, you're rewarded with a handsome annual percentage yield (APY) on your balance for that month. For this reason, these high-yield products are sometimes called rewards checking accounts.

The most commonly required hoop is using the account's debit card some minimum number of times each month. And we're not talking about three or four transactions. Typically, high-yield checking accounts require you to use your debit card 10, 12, or even 15 times each month, while some accounts stipulate that a minimum dollar amount must be spent on debit.

Other common requirements include requiring direct deposit, sometimes with a minimum dollar amount specified; having an ACH credit or debit post to your account; and signing up for electronic statements. Some also require logging into your online banking account a minimum number of times each month, while others allow you to meet requirements with a credit card issued by that institution.
Besides noting an account's list of monthly requirements, you'll also want to find out the maximum balance that can earn the high APY. Almost every high-yield checking account paying a competitive interest rate will specify how much of your balance is eligible for that advertised rate. For instance, it may indicate that the APY applies just to the first $5,000 of your balance. Though sometimes the thresholds can go as high as $30,000 or $40,000, it's more common to see maximums of $10,000, $15,000, or $25,000.
For this reason, it's best to keep your balance in this account at or below the maximum, as any portion of your balance in excess of the maximum will typically earn either nothing or some very minimal rate. This dilutes what you earn on your full balance, so the best way to maximize your return is by staying under the maximum and moving surplus funds to another high-yield account, such as a savings account.
It's also important to realize how much of an impact missing a month of requirements can be. Yes, you can earn 6% month in and month out, so long as you meet the requirements every month. But if you miss a month or more, your effective APY for the year goes down considerably, as you can see in the graph below. So be sure you choose an account you confidently expect you can succeed with every month.
The following high-yield checking accounts pay at least 6.00% APY when monthly requirements are met, and they are available to anyone nationwide. All are offered by institutions that are federally insured (by the FDIC for banks or the NCUA for credit unions), meaning your deposits up to $250,000 are protected in the unlikely case the institution fails.

Pelican State Credit Union - 6.05% APY on balances up to $10,000. Monthly requirements include: 15 qualifying debit transactions; at least one direct deposit, online bill payment, or automatic payment (ACH); agreement to receive electronic statements; and enrollment in online banking. Anyone can qualify to join Pelican State by making a $5 donation to one of the credit union's affiliated nonprofits.
Credit Union of New Jersey - 6.00% APY on balances up to $25,000. Monthly requirements include: 12 qualifying debit card transactions; at least one direct deposit, ACH credit, ACH payment, or bill pay transaction; and agreement to receive electronic statements. Anyone is eligible to join the credit union by making a $5 donation to the Credit Union of New Jersey Foundation.
Fitness Bank - 6.00% APY on balances up to $25,000. Monthly requirements include: maintaining an average of 10,000 steps per day using the FitnessBank Step Tracker app; making 15 qualifying debit transactions; and opening the account with a minimum deposit of $100.
Orion Federal Credit Union - 6.00% APY on balances up to $10,000. Monthly requirements include: spending at least $500 on your Orion debit or credit card, and receiving electronic deposits totaling at least $500. Anyone can join the credit union.
Texas Bank - 6.17% APY on balances up to $25,000, available to all Texas residents. Monthly requirements include: 12 qualifying debit transactions; at least one direct deposit or direct debit; and agreement to receive electronic statements.
ELGA Credit Union - 6.17% APY on balances up to $15,000, available to anyone who lives, works, or goes to school in Michigan. Monthly requirements include: 15 qualifying debit transactions; at least one ACH or direct deposit; and agreement to receive electronic statements.
Collins Community Credit Union - 6.05% APY on balances up to $15,000, available to those living in select areas of Iowa or Illinois. Monthly requirements include: 15 qualifying debit transactions; at least one direct deposit of $100 or more; at least one login to online banking; and agreement to receive electronic statements.
Union Square Credit Union - 6.01% APY on balances up to $35,000, available to residents of certain Oklahoma and Texas counties. Monthly requirements include: 12 qualifying debit transactions; at least one direct deposit, ACH credit, or ACH payment transaction; enrollment in online banking; and agreement to receive electronic statements.
If you don't think you'll be able to keep on top of the requirements for a high-yield checking account every month—or simply don't want the bother of thinking about these hoops every statement cycle—there are easier ways to earn a high return on your cash savings.
High-yield savings accounts are one of the simplest options. Though the best high-yield savings accounts don't pay as high as 6.00% APY, you gain the low-maintenance advantage of not needing to pay any attention to your account except when you want to deposit or withdraw funds.
Similarly, money market accounts offer you a low-stress way to just keep your money socked away—and earning a high rate if you choose from one of the best money market accounts. One advantage you gain with a money market account over a savings account is the ability to write paper checks.
Lastly, today's certificates of deposit (CDs) are paying record rates, and you can earn as much as 5.76% with the top choice in our ranking of the best CD rates. Though it's true you can't touch the money for the length of the CD term you choose (without facing an early withdrawal penalty), you gain the ability to truly ""set it and forget it,"" letting your CD balance simply accrue interest with no transactions needed.

Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

high-yield savings account advantages,Most Big Banks Pay Peanuts. These Savings Accounts Pay 5.25% or More.,"It's easy to earn 5% or more on your savings—but not with any of the big-name banks. Instead, these smaller banks are just as safe but pay 500 times more interest.",https://www.investopedia.com/big-bank-savings-cd-rates-earn-so-much-more-7968654,"If you're keeping your savings at one of the biggest U.S. banks, you're likely losing out on a lot of interest your cash could be earning. That's because you can earn literally hundreds of times more with a high-yield savings account. Even better, you don't have to change your checking account to take advantage of nation-leading savings account rates.
You may wonder whether it's worth moving some of your money to a high-yield savings account, rather than keep it where you do your primary banking. It's true that having money in two places will sometimes require transferring money between banks. But when you see how little some of the country's biggest banks are paying, you'll likely be convinced the substantially higher interest payments you can earn are worth the very slight extra effort.
Savings account rates from the five largest consumer banks in the U.S. (ranked by assets) are shown below. These five banks account for more than a third of all deposits held by all FDIC-insured banks, so millions of Americans hold accounts at these banks.1
As you can see, only Citi pays an even remotely competitive interest rate on its savings account, currently 4.35% APY in some markets. (In other markets, its rate is 0.12% APY.)2 Meanwhile, Chase, Bank of America, and U.S. Bank are paying virtually zero, at 0.01% APY.345 And while Wells Fargo outdoes those three by several multiples, it's still only paying 0.15% APY, with an option to earn a still unimpressive 0.25% APY if you keep a larger balance in your account.6
In stark contrast to the big bank rates, it's easy to score a rate above 5% by choosing from our daily ranking of the top-paying savings accounts. Our list always provides the top 15 account rates currently available to customers nationwide, including eight current offers between 5.25% and 5.33% APY.
The difference in earnings between the big banks and the leading high-yield savings accounts can really add up. Take the example of holding $5,000 in savings for one year.
As you can see, letting a bank hold $5,000 of your money for a full year and giving you 50 cents in return is not a smart money move, considering it's easy to instead earn upward of $250 on that same balance if you deposit it elsewhere. And if you hold more in savings than $5,000, you stand to gain even more by moving your money.
Only have $1,000 in savings? Sure, your earnings over a year will be less. But you still have the opportunity to earn more than $50 from a high-yield savings account, rather than only a penny per month from the banks paying 0.01% APY.
If you haven't held an account at a medium or smaller bank before, you may be concerned your money will be less safe at a new bank, or that having funds at two different institutions will be inconvenient. But these are easy worries to dispel.
Any bank that is an FDIC member is equally insured against bank failure. Each depositor is covered for up to $250,000 in deposits at each FDIC institution where they hold funds (and at each NCUA-insured credit union as well). So you are no more or less protected at a small bank than at a large one.
Online banks are also federally insured. Many of the online banks you encounter in our rankings are simply internet divisions of existing physical banks. But even internet-only institutions are FDIC insured. Just look for the words ""FDIC Member"" or the FDIC logo on the website of any bank where you're planning to open an account.
Having your money at more than one bank will involve transferring funds between them. But with today's online banking interfaces, this is extremely easy to do. Transfers typically take one to three days to appear in the receiving account, but so long as you don't move money that you'll need within that time frame to your outside savings account, the process is simple and convenient to manage.
You can also easily set up automated transfers from your primary account to your outside savings account to, say, put away a certain amount each month to reach a special savings goal.

If you still feel more comfortable depositing your money under the roof of a really big bank, know that some large institutions pay much better rates than others. Above we considered the five largest banks by assets, but within the top 25 largest banks, you have some more competitive options.
Note that most of the above are online-only accounts, though Capital One and BMO Harris operate some physical branches. As we've pointed out, however, this shouldn't cause concern since online banking makes transfers between banks easy to execute.

tips for managing dedicated bill accounts,Top 7 Finance Tips for New Grads,Congratulations! You made it through your degree. But now what? Don’t stress—here are our top tips for managing your finances after graduation.,https://www.investopedia.com/top-7-finance-tips-for-new-grads-5248426,"Transitioning from school to the working world can seem daunting enough without having to think about all the other responsibilities that come along with it. But don’t stress—here are our top tips for managing your finances after graduation.
Before embarking on this new phase of life, it can be helpful to take a moment to reflect on where you’ve come from and where you’d like to go. Understanding your past spending and saving habits is a good first step in being able to navigate this time of major financial change.
Maybe you have a tendency to spend more than you would like to in social settings, like when you’re out with friends. Perhaps you reward yourself after stressful events by online shopping or ordering in dinner. Or maybe you have a tendency not to spend much money at all, and you faithfully track your transactions and watch your account balance like a hawk. 
None of these are good or bad things, per se—they’re just preferences and habits that people develop around money and spending. However, more self-awareness is never a bad thing, so taking the time to think about and identify your money personality can be helpful in anticipating your spending patterns, and if required, changing them to suit your current financial situation.
A budget is simply a plan for your money, and when it comes to money, it’s best not to wing it. That doesn’t mean you can’t ever be spontaneous, and it doesn’t have to be perfect, but you should know roughly the amount of money going into your account(s) vs. the amount of money coming out. This way, you won’t spend more than you would like to, or incur unnecessary debt by spending money that you might not have. 
There are many different methods for budgeting, but at their core, they all help in figuring out the answer to this question: what are your financial inputs, and what are your financial outputs? Put differently, how much do you make, and how much do you spend? Once you get organized, you’ll be better able to anticipate what your finances will look like on any given day.
Use this free budgeting calculator, take a look at some apps and software, or try out the straightforward 50/30/20 rule for creating a budget, which allocates 50% of your earnings to your needs, 30% to your wants, and 20% to savings.

 You can also break things down into the short term and long term to help with big expenses and financial goals. A good first step is making a list of your recurring bills and their payment deadlines and keeping everything in one place, whether it’s consolidating paper bills in one folder or having all e-bills sent to a dedicated email address.
One way to think about saving is to frame it as paying yourself first: your future self, your vacation self, yourself in an emergency—you name it. It’s helpful to incorporate savings planning into your budget by regularly setting aside a portion of your income, but you can also conduct a quick exercise at any time to assess your current finances and make a plan to save up. 
Another way to think about saving is to divide it into short-term and long-term goals. Short-term saving can focus on things like going on vacation, or building up an emergency fund in case you lose your job, experience a medical emergency, or have to pay an unanticipated expense. Long-term savings goals could be buying a home or planning for retirement.
Saving isn’t just about setting money aside, however. You can also take advantage of different types of savings accounts that will help you save on tax, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k). Many employers will even match contributions to retirement accounts, which provides a great incentive to save. As the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) puts it, “You may be walking away from free money by not contributing to your employer-sponsored retirement plan.”

Another way to save is to invest so that your money grows over time. Maybe you've heard buzz and discussion over meme stocks like GameStop Corp. (GME) or AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC), and while the excitement that those generate can be tempting to be a part of, it’s best to start slow and steady with something like an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a mutual fund. If you’re eager to jump right in and figure out the stock market, try a simulator tool so that your real, hard-earned money and future financial well-being aren't on the line.

Another big post-graduation priority should be paying off your loans. Most student loans give the borrower a six-month grace period after graduating before they have to begin paying back their loans.
3
Make sure you understand how much you owe, which types of student loans you have (federal vs. private), whether they are subsidized or unsubsidized, and which repayment options are available to you. Then make a plan to pay it back. Tools like the Department of Education's student loan calculator can be helpful resources. 
Your payment plan, like your budget, can be flexible and should be evaluated according to your current and future financial priorities and situation. For example, you might have a high-paying job lined up post-graduation or you might be planning to pursue further studies at some point in the future. These two different situations would likely result in different decisions regarding the duration and frequency of repayment amounts, and the method of paying them back. 
In considering your payment plan, it’s also worth finding out whether you can deduct a portion of your student loan interest payments on your federal tax return, whether it might be beneficial to consolidate or refinance your loans, or whether you can consider loan deferment.

When looking for a job or before accepting a job offer, make sure to research the typical market salary for your position so that you know what your experience is worth and what a reasonable (or, even better, a generous) offer looks like.
It’s also important to read up on the benefits offered by the companies you are applying for and weigh them against the salary offer. This includes things like health insurance, retirement plans, employee perks, and paid time off. In some cases, it may be worth it to accept a slightly lower salary if it comes with better benefits, depending on your situation. If it’s not possible to negotiate your salary, there may also be other perks that you could negotiate as part of an offer. For example, some companies even offer help with student loans to entice potential employees.
Try creating budgets around different net salaries (this could simply be a spreadsheet with a couple of different columns) to understand what a typical month at a certain income level might look and feel like for you. Even if a certain salary is not realistic for the time being, it can be a motivating goal to work towards in your career and a reminder to ask for a well-earned raise or negotiate your salary if and when possible.
Make sure you understand any health insurance plans that you might have. If you are under the age of 26 and your parents have a private health insurance plan, you can be covered as a dependent until you turn 26. If you have an insurance plan through your employer, make sure you read through it to understand your health benefits and use them as much as possible—think of it as leaving money on the table if you don’t.

If you're young and healthy and don't go to the doctor often, you may benefit from choosing a high deductible health plan, as these won't cost as much when it comes to your paycheck and you won't be spending much on doctor's appointments. You would want a low deductible health plan if you go to the doctor often, as it would save you money over the course of the year, even if it costs more per paycheck.
Lots of good financial habits are similar to flossing your teeth: small tasks that, when done regularly, can have a great preventative impact on your (in this case, financial) health. These are things like:
The first two can help you gain insight into your spending patterns as well as help prevent or identify identity theft if you notice any unusual transactions. The latter two will help your credit score, as well as your overall financial well-being, in the short and long term.

Although it may seem daunting to transition to life post-college, organizing your finances, paying back your student loans, and understanding expectations for your first job are actually quite manageable if you come equipped with as much knowledge as possible. Having a plan and learning as much as you can about these new challenges will make this transition much smoother."
tips for managing dedicated bill accounts,Top 10 Home Business Tax Tips,"Learn some of the top business tax tips that may help you avoid unnecessary tax burdens if you are self-employed, own, or manage a small business.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/11/home-business-tax-tips.asp,"It is said so often that it has become a bit of a cliché, but one of the great virtues of starting a home business is the tax breaks you can claim. Another popular belief surrounding home businesses, however, is that claiming aggressive—and maybe slightly exaggerated—write-offs is a surefire way to attract Internal Revenue Service (IRS) auditors. In this article, we'll look at some of the more popular home business write-offs as well as some tips on how you can legitimately claim them.
Being audited is not the end of the world. However, being audited and not having the records to back up your deductions can be a nightmare. The simplest way to avoid this unpleasant situation is to keep a daily log of your home business activities.
Did you buy paper for the printer in your office? Write it down and either attach the receipt to the page in the case of a hard copy or scan the receipt if you are keeping a digital log. The same goes for mileage, phone calls, and other costs, as well as payments received by your business.
The more detailed your accounts are, the easier it will be to face an audit. Compiling your daily reports into a monthly tracking sheet will drastically shorten the time it takes you to get your taxes together, and it will have the added benefit of providing a snapshot of your business month-to-month.
Writing off a home office can be particularly attractive if you have a line of work that can be neatly confined to a dedicated room. You can still write off part of a shared room, but in either case, space is calculated as a percentage of the total house or apartment area.
That percentage is applied to all the related costs, including utilities, insurance, rent or mortgage payments, and so on. Do not claim unrelated expenses like the installation of a bird fountain in the backyard—those types of stretches make IRS auditors less agreeable.
1
Office furniture, software, computers, and other equipment are all 100% deductible within the year that the cost is incurred—you don't need to depreciate. There is an upper limit and the purchases must be majority-usage (primarily used) and necessary or helpful for business. Within those generous guidelines, however, you should have no problem keeping current. However, a widescreen TV and La-Z-Boy for the office is going to be a hard sell.
1
If you are working solely for your home business, you will have to pay the employer's share of Social Security and insurance, but you can deduct half the amount of Social Security and the total premiums for you and any employees.
2
You can also fund retirement plans designed for the self-employed—SEP-IRA, Keogh plans, etc.—and write the contributions off against your personal income tax.
If chatting with clients is a necessary (or helpful) part of your business, it may be worth getting a second phone line or a dedicated business cell phone, as both of these are 100% deductible. If you only converse with clients occasionally, you can still write off the costs by noting the dates, times, and reasons for the calls and then circling the items on your regular phone bill to deduct at tax time.
1
Similar to the phone bill, you can deduct part of the cost of your Internet if you use it for business. There is no absolute percentage to use, but it will be difficult to write off more than 50% if other members of your family are using it for non-business purposes. Be reasonable and pick a defensible percentage that you won't regret in the case of an audit.
You can wine and dine clients—emphasis on clients (preferably paying or likely to pay clients)—and get a tax break. The tendency for business owners at all levels to abuse this write-off has scared many home business owners away from claiming it.
1
However, it is acceptable for you to take out a client for a meal and some entertainment. It will be easier to defend a $200 deduction for a client who has brought you a lot of business than the same meal for a buddy who paid you $20 for an hour's work over the entire fiscal year.
Have to hit the road to expand your market? Save your receipts. On business trips, your travel expenses are 100% deductible. Although food expenses were deductible at only 50%, Congress made temporary provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in Dec. 2020.
3
Keep all of your receipts because even things like dry cleaning and tips are considered a necessary expense when you're out pounding the pavement in new markets.
Your local day-to-day mileage incurred for business purposes can be written off as well, so give the same attention to tracking your mileage on smaller trips that you would to the expenses of an overnight trip. For many people, the mileage deduction is a more realistic deduction than first-class tickets to New York. Remember, you have to be able to justify any trip and preferably show the payoff to your business resulting from it.
4
You can use family members as employees and deduct their salaries as long as you can account for their work and pay the going rate. If you have a business that lends itself to having a spouse and kids help out, then use that labor pool. You'll likely pay less than market rates for the help, and you can deduct insurance premiums for them as well.
As an added bonus, children under the age of 17 don't incur the Social Security tax, but they can still make contributions to a Roth IRA—so you can teach them a work ethic and saving habits in one go.
5
The most important tip has been a theme throughout, but it is worth repeating: just because you have a home business doesn't mean you can go crazy with deductions. If you don't think you can face down an auditor with detailed proof justifying the deduction, then perhaps it isn't a deduction you should be taking.
A home business can be a rewarding experience, both for the extra income it can bring in and the tax breaks it yields. Reading through the IRS small business publications is well worth your time. You will learn more about the deductions mentioned here and what conditions need to be met to claim them.
Although it is important to keep accurate records and stick to deductions you can justify, it is also in your interest to maximize your deductions as much as you can while staying within the rules. The IRS guides are not nearly as difficult as they are made out to be, but if you still feel adrift after reading them, then finding a good business accountant will save you time and hopefully a lot of money."
tips for managing dedicated bill accounts,10 Tips for Saving Money on a Tight Budget,Try these 10 less-expected ways to build up your cash reserves in tough times. You could surprise yourself.,https://www.investopedia.com/tips-for-saving-money-on-a-tight-budget-5185769,"What can we tell you about saving money on a tight budget that you don’t already know? You don’t need another source advising you to ditch cable television, use coupons, find more people to share housing expenses with, or—God forbid—get a side hustle. 

You’re already busy and tired, but you’re still motivated to save more money, whether your goal is paying off debt, building your emergency fund, contributing to your IRA, or something else. Let’s try to dig deeper and offer some money-saving tips you might not have thought of yet.
Your electric company may offer free tools for assessing your home energy use and suggest ways to lower your consumption or lower your bill. For example, if you’re not on a time-of-use plan, and it’s an option where you live, switching to one could save you money. If you are, changing when you use energy-intensive appliances such as clothes dryers, clothes washers, and dishwashers could lower your bill.
The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program works with states to help people stay warm in winter and cool in summer.

 Qualifications and levels of assistance vary by state to provide assistance with heating and cooling bills. Some programs will even replace a broken furnace or boiler or help weatherize your home to reduce energy bills.

Some tasks are too dangerous to DIY. Other times, you might make a problem worse and more expensive to fix if you try to do the work yourself. But some tasks we might hire people to do are surprisingly cheap and easy to handle ourselves after we’ve watched someone else do them. From changing your car’s air filter to replacing your oven’s heating element, the next time you have a problem you’d normally pay a professional to fix, do some video research first. 
Most of us think about the big three—T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T—when we think about cellphone providers. But their recurring monthly plans are expensive and may provide more data, faster speeds, and newer phone technology than you need. 
If you switch to one of their prepaid plans, you may be able to cut your monthly bill in half. Moving to a smaller provider such as Republic Wireless, Ting, or Mint Mobile can also lower your bill. So can paying up front for at least three months of service. Plans get super cheap if you ditch cellular data altogether and stick to talking, texting, and WiFi.
Newspapers. Television. Movies. Music. Cloud storage. Photo editing. Word processing. Exercise classes. Sometimes it seems like every company uses a subscription business model these days. Getting someone to sign up for a service and pay for it forever is a great way to make money. That means you need to do the opposite if you want to save money. 
Out of all your subscriptions, which one do you use most? Allow yourself that indulgence, and cut the rest. Many have free alternatives. Also, you don’t have to pick one subscription and stick with it all year. For anything that’s month to month, you can switch it up: Hulu this month, Netflix next month, Spotify the month after that.
If the pandemic-induced toilet paper shortage didn’t already convince you to try a bidet in 2020, now’s the time to think about one. It doesn't sound like a budgeting idea, but entry-level models that attach to the side of your toilet seat cost just $30 to $40 on Amazon and will quickly pay for themselves in toilet paper and wet-wipe savings. Bidets are efficient, so they won’t run up your water bill. The low-end models don’t use electricity. And cutting back on your use of disposable products is good for the environment.
You might believe that forcing yourself to not spend any money for a week or a month would just create a lot of pent-up demand. If you don’t buy groceries now, won’t you just buy more later? Maybe. But you also might find yourself reevaluating those purchases you postponed. 
If you survived for a week drinking ice water with dinner because you ran out of Coke Zero, maybe you can kick your can-a-day habit, or at least cut it in half. You won’t make any impulse buys of unnecessary items. And you might find a free way to hang out with a friend. Whether you try it for a day, a week, or a month, a no-spend challenge can kick your account balance up a notch.  
There’s so much wealth and generosity in the United States that we should all feel comfortable accepting help when we need it. We’re talking food banks, pet pantries, free farmers markets, community gardens, school-supply giveaways, healthcare clinics, sliding-scale mental health services, Medicaid, hospital charity programs, and more. 
Granted, these resources are more abundant in some areas than others. But whatever you have access to, take advantage of it. When your circumstances improve, you can always return the generosity of the organizations that served you by donating your time or money.
It’s so tempting to raise your deductible or decrease your coverage to lower your insurance premiums. But remember why insurance is there. If your car gets totaled, a pipe bursts in the upstairs apartment and floods you out, or a windstorm pulls off the roof of your house, good insurance coverage will get your life back to normal much faster without messing up your finances. 
And if you’re a pet parent, spend the $20 to $50 a month on pet insurance for your furry best friend. When they need emergency surgery, you’ll thank yourself.
It’s miserable putting every penny of your income toward necessities and saving. You’ll stretch your willpower too thin and risk setting yourself back with a spending splurge. Instead, make a conscious choice at the beginning of every week, month, or pay period about how much money you’ll allow yourself to spend on fun things—within your overall budget, of course.  
Then, enjoy those treats guilt-free. And if you want to save up for something bigger, roll over your allowance from one period to the next. A cash envelope or dedicated savings account can help you manage your fun money and keep it separate from your essential spending.
Some expenses are almost impossible to eliminate. But that doesn’t mean you can’t reduce them. In particular, lowering your recurring expenses can be a big help because it will give you savings every month, not just one time. 
Also, don’t forget that saving money is a long-term goal. Don’t make short-sighted decisions like slashing or forgoing insurance coverage that might cost you big in the long run and undo all the progress you’ve made. At the same time, many small savings choices can pay off big in the long run."
