DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

On Tuesday, Instagram announced it was going to set teenager accounts to private by default. A recent sextortion case on the platform, one of many to have plagued Instagram over recent years, highlights why Meta has felt the need to lock down accounts owned by younger users.

A Virginia man was charged in May this year with carrying out a sextortion campaign over Instagram and Kik Messenger, using a real-life porn actress’ photos to trick as many as 60 victims into sharing nude images, previously-unreported court records show.

Gary Owens Jr. has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which allege he grabbed online photos of the porn star, who now lives in Florida, and convinced victims he was a real young teenage woman named Jessica Lincon who wanted to engage in a sexual relationship with them. The government did not say why Owens was doing it other than to trick victims into producing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) for him.

After the cops searched Owens’ iPad, they discovered Google searches for the adult entertainment actress and evidence he’d visited porn sites to view images of the porn star, as well as hundreds of photos and videos of her undressed or performing sex acts. Investigators also found over 900 images of “males in some stage of undress or engaged in a sex act,” according to a search warrant.

Forbes understands the actress has not been contacted by law enforcement regarding the use of her photos. She did not respond to requests for comment and Forbes is withholding publishing her name. From online discussions amongst porn enthusiasts, it appears the actress has removed many of her videos and photos from popular adult content aggregators as well as an OnlyFans page.

The government gathered evidence indicating Owens operated his sextortion campaign from 2021 through to 2024. In its criminal complaint against the defendant, the government said it had identified 13 minors as definitive victims, but said “there are at least 51 additional potential victims that have not yet been fully identified."" In the search warrant, filed after the complaint, the FBI said it had identified more than 30 minor victims and was continuing to investigate. A trial is due to go ahead in early 2025.

Kik Messenger owner MediaLab.ai didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment on the case, but pointed Forbes to its new protections against sextortion. In announcing Instagram Teen Accounts on Tuesday, the Meta site said not only will teenage users be set to private, meaning they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to, those under 16 will need their parent’s permission to use less protective settings.

Dawn Hawkins, CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, praised Meta for taking “a tremendous step forward to ensuring minors are better protected from harm by defaulting teen accounts to private.”

“Instagram has been a leader in facilitating harm to minors – it’s been the top platform where perpetrators have threatened to and have actually distributed sextortion images,” Hawkins added. “We are grateful that Meta has acted on our concerns to ensure that accounts belonging to teens 16 and younger are defaulted to the highest safety settings.”

Why Ex-Intel Agents Think Hezbollah Pagers Started Exploding Amid Suspicions Of Israel Hack

An ex-IDF agent and a former NSA analyst tell Forbes that it’s unlikely Israel carried out an entirely remote hack to make Hezbollah pagers explode, as they did en masse on Tuesday. Instead, they suspect the devices were intercepted, tampered with and sent on to Hezbollah operatives before being set off. It’s not a particularly difficult piece of sabotage to pull off either, requiring some rudimentary hacking skills and explosive materials that could be bought off Amazon, the ex-analysts say.

GETTY

In the spring of 2024, Bronx high school student Malena Galletto made headlines after being accepted to all eight Ivy League schools—in addition to the 20 other schools to which she had applied. Incredible stories of students like Malena defying the admissions odds circulate every spring, and while they certainly inspire students, they also mislead them.

Many students who read about the unbelievable successes of those accepted to all eight Ivies assume that they can improve their own odds by simply applying to all of the Ivy League schools. However, this is not the case, and devoting time and energy to completing eight Ivy League applications is actually a detrimental strategy for most students—here’s why:

1. Every Ivy League School is Distinct

While many students and parents regard “the Ivy League” as a homogenous bloc of elite schools, the league is made up of vastly different schools, each with its own character, offerings, and campus—and every Ivy League school is not a good fit for every student. When compiling their balanced college lists, students should think strategically about the types of programs, campuses, learning environments, and communities they want access to. Do you want to attend a small school with a low student-to-faculty ratio or a large school with a plethora of opportunities? Are you interested in conducting lab research or are you more focused on the classroom experience? Will you thrive in a city or a rural setting? A student’s college list should be reflective of their answers to these questions and thus tailored to their needs and goals—both personal and academic.

A student who approaches their college list in this way will almost certainly not craft a list that includes all eight Ivy Leagues. While Dartmouth students are minutes away from hiking and skiing opportunities in rural New Hampshire, Columbia undergraduates have New York City’s entertainment and internships at their immediate disposal. Harvard offers students a highly traditional and structured academic environment. Meanwhile, Brown is known for its Open Curriculum and its diverse, creative, and interdisciplinary approach to education—one that is best suited for students who gravitate toward multiple different disciplines or want to think outside the box. As a land-grant institution, Cornell attracts students who are community minded and who want to use their learning to benefit not only the college but also Ithaca’s tight-knit community, while UPenn is known for graduating students who have a global mindset and are prepared to enter the upper echelons of their professions. In other words, students should not regard Ivy League schools as synonymous with “elite education,” but should instead weigh their interest in each individual school based on its programs, culture, and unique offerings.

2. Applying to All Eight Schools Doesn’t Increase Your Odds of Admission

It’s a common misconception that applying to all eight Ivy League schools will improve your chances of acceptance to at least one. First and foremost, students should note that applying to eight schools, all with single-digit acceptance rates, does nothing to increase their odds at any single one of them. On the contrary, it actually detracts from a student’s overall odds of admission by overloading their college list with reach schools at the expense of matches and safeties. That is to say, students are hedging their bets at schools where they face overwhelming odds of rejection (even if they are highly qualified), rather than balancing their list with schools that they are more likely to earn acceptance to.

Additionally, each Ivy League school has its own specific admissions criteria—just as every Ivy League school is not a fit for every student, every student is not a fit for every Ivy League school. A standout Ivy League application is meticulously tailored to demonstrate a student’s unique qualifications for a specific institution. Students who apply to all eight schools often cut corners, overgeneralize their reasons for applying, or tailor their answers to what they assume “Ivy League admissions officers” want to hear—all of which can negatively impact their chances of acceptance. Those who truly wish to attend a given Ivy League school should focus dedicated energy on leveling up their application materials to the particular school that aligns with their authentic interests and goals and ensure that they are putting their best foot forward in their materials.

3. Hyper-Focusing on the Ivy League Can Distract You from Better Matches

If you are applying to all eight Ivy League schools simply because of their prestige, not only will you likely craft inauthentic and unimpressive applications, but you will also miss out on other great schools that may be a better fit for you. Remember that rankings and low admissions rates are not the only measures of a school’s rigor and excellence. Rather than devoting countless hours to writing supplemental essays for every Ivy League school, you should spend your time researching a diversity of schools that house strong programs in your intended area of study. If you are interested in STEM, for instance, you might find that CalTech or UT Austin’s innovative and forward-thinking programs are a better fit for you than Harvard’s traditional option.

Ultimately, students should not apply to all eight Ivy League institutions—or any school—just for the sake of applying or because of the prestige associated with earning an acceptance. At the same time, students can gain strategic insights from the inspiring students who were accepted to all eight Ivies. How did some of the students deciding between all of the Ivies make their choice? In 2014, Kwasi Enin chose Yale after visiting the campus and enjoying the school’s residential college system and friendly student body. Craig McFarland originally chose Yale, but changed his plans when the pandemic forced him to reprioritize having a support system nearby, leading him to choose Harvard. Ashley Adirika—a Florida teen who was accepted to all eight Ivies in 2022—made her decision based on the strength of Harvard’s academic offerings in her field of interest: “[W]hen I did further research for what I want to do specifically, which is explorations in policy and social policy and things of that nature, Harvard just had a better program.”"

 COURTESY OF CANOPY

“We were just not really thinking of the problems in a holistic way,” said Nicole Rycroft, founder and executive director of Canopy, a solutions-oriented non-profit that works to save the world’s forests. “There was this shift from plastic packaging to paper packaging, which is akin to trading one environmental disaster for another one, plastic pollution for deforestation.”

Three billion trees are cut down each year to make paper packaging, Rycroft said, noting that Patagonia, has made a commitment to use wood-alternatives in its packaging, including Next Generation materials such as materials made from waste.

“Patagonia is often part of a catalytic spark,” Rycroft said of the company, which was one of the first four brands to sign up with the organization in 2013. Patagonia has developed and formalized its commitment. It’s committed at least from the textile side, to eliminating old tree fibers altogether.

“What we see embedded in the Pack4Good journey is a commitment to the next step which is, fundamentally, striving to be more circular and ensuring that none of their operations is impacting the world’s forests,” said Rycroft. “The majority of Patagonia’s packaging is already 100% recycled paper, that’s their catalogs, their hangtags, their packaging. Under Pack4Good, they’re ensuring there’s smart design and that they can diversify the fiber basket.”

There are over 400 companies signed up for Pack4Good. Rycroft works with individual brands to find custom solutions. For example, Canopy helped Champagne company Veuve Clicquot redevelop its Eco- Yellow Label box and shifted it from being 100% virgin fiber to being 50% hemp and 50% recycled content.

Because of hemp’s qualities Veuve Clicquot was able to make the box 12% lighter. Hemp has broader efficiencies in fiber as well as it’s helpful for transportation. It’s good for transportation because it reduces the weight of products.

Patagonia is innovating, too. Whether it’s agricultural residues like wheat straw, which has excellent qualities for making packaging, or longer fibers like hemp, Patagonia is sending a signal to its supply chain that it has zero tolerance for frittering away the earth’s forests.

“As part of our goal to build the best product and constantly improve everything we do, we’re taking steps to review and develop new, more responsible packaging materials in partnership with Canopy,” said Jennifer Patrick, packaging and branding director of Patagonia.

Canopy has been educating brands. “Back in 2013 most brands weren’t aware that viscose and rayon textiles originated from the world’s forests,” Rycroft said, adding that the campaign initiative has 550 brands that represent $1.7 trillion in sales. “Because those brands have sent a really consistent message through their supply chains, 71% of global viscose producers have taken action to shift their exposure from high risk sourcing to low risk sourcing.

“We have these solutions, it’s just a question of mobilizing the investment and bringing it to scale and making sure member companies are aware of them and are able to pull them through to their inventory,” Rycroft said. “There’s no shortage of solutions. Patagonia is ensuring that viscose and rayon textiles don’t originate from endangered forests. Now, they’re ensuring that their paper-based packaging does not.”

Rather than have any reliance on forests, Patagonia is looking to play a significant role in kick-starting the Next Generation of solutions of fibers that have a smaller footprint. There’s mountains of straw left over after the harvest, which can actually be monetized and in doing so can help revitalize rural areas. “When it gets to the pulp mill, there’s an average of 4 tons less carbon per ton of product for packaging made from straw versus that made from trees and forests. There’s also up to 60% less water used, and five times less impact on biodiversity,” Rycroft said."

GETTY

You probably find lots of junk mail in your mailbox. But, if you are one of the 50 million beneficiaries with Part D prescription drug coverage, either through a stand-alone Part D drug plan or incorporated into a Medicare Advantage plan, pay attention now. Buried in that stack of mail will be the Annual Notice of Changes (ANOC), a letter about Open Enrollment and your Part D drug coverage for next year.

The Open Enrollment Period, October 15-December 7, is your chance to ensure you have the best plan in 2025 and the ANOC is your guide to the changes. A KFF analysis showed that only 3 in 10 beneficiaries (29%) compared their current plan with others during Open Enrollment. If I had the space, I could share dozens of tales of woe from those who got caught asleep at the wheel and woke up on January 2 to unpleasant cost and coverage issues.

This may be the most important Open Enrollment you have experienced. Why do I believe that? Six words – the $2,000 cap on drug costs. According to a White House fact sheet, this cap will save nearly 19 million Part D enrollees at least $400 next year. However, it will create cost and coverage challenges for many. Part D drug plans will pick up most of these costs so they likely will implement measures to reduce the hit. The elimination of the 5% Catastrophic Coverage coinsurance is one small step toward the $2,000 cap that is expected to save 1.5 million drug plan enrollees about $3,100. 65 Incorporated reviewed 2024 drug plans to identify the impact.

59 of 65 plans increased their monthly premiums, anywhere from 2% to 84%.
Almost a third of drug plans changed a copayment to a coinsurance. One example, instead of $47, the cost sharing is 25%, increasing the out-of-pocket cost.
And 30% of plans increased the coinsurance for Tier 4 and Tier 5 drugs. Even a change of 1-2% can increase costs by several hundred dollars a month.

We can expect to see more of the same with 2025 plans.




Here’s What To Do with the Annual Notice

Insurers sponsoring Part D coverage must send an ANOC to all plan members by September 30. The notice can be 15-30 pages or more, depending on your plan. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has a template that identifies some important pages. Check these out.

Page 4: A summary of important costs for 2025.

This summarizes the changes in premium and drug tier cost sharing. You’ll discover whether your premium is increasing and/or the tier costs for your drugs will change, especially a copayment changing to a coinsurance.

Page 6: Section 1, unless you choose another plan …

The plan you have this year may not be around next year. If that happens, you will be enrolled automatically in another plan. When this has happened in the past, plans tended to assign enrollees to the one with the highest premium.

Page 7: Section 2.2, changes to the pharmacy network.

The plan will alert you if changes have been made but you will have to research which pharmacies are in or out.

Page 8: Section 2.3, changes to Part D prescription drug coverage.

This is one of the most important sections in the ANOC. The plan must provide a copy of the drug list (unlikely) or electronically (a link). If there have been no changes to covered drugs, tier assignments, or restrictions (prior authorization, step therapy), you can breathe a sigh of relief. However, in the current environment, it’s more likely that there will be changes. The ANOC emphasizes, “Review the Drug List to make sure your drugs will be covered next year and to see if there will be any restrictions, or if your drug has been moved to a different cost-sharing tier.”

Pages 11-16: Changes to your cost-sharing in the drug payment stages.

You’ll find out the plan’s deductible and standard and preferred cost-sharing in each payment stage.




Next Steps

The ANOC will identify the changes in your plan but then, it’s up to you. You’ll need the Medicare Plan Finder to determine the impact of changes. 2025 plan information will start appearing in early October. CMS has a video, “2023 How to use Medicare Plan Finder, step-by-step,” that provides a good introduction to using this tool.

GETTY

In the spring of 2024, Bronx high school student Malena Galletto made headlines after being accepted to all eight Ivy League schools—in addition to the 20 other schools to which she had applied. Incredible stories of students like Malena defying the admissions odds circulate every spring, and while they certainly inspire students, they also mislead them.

Many students who read about the unbelievable successes of those accepted to all eight Ivies assume that they can improve their own odds by simply applying to all of the Ivy League schools. However, this is not the case, and devoting time and energy to completing eight Ivy League applications is actually a detrimental strategy for most students—here’s why:

1. Every Ivy League School is Distinct

While many students and parents regard “the Ivy League” as a homogenous bloc of elite schools, the league is made up of vastly different schools, each with its own character, offerings, and campus—and every Ivy League school is not a good fit for every student. When compiling their balanced college lists, students should think strategically about the types of programs, campuses, learning environments, and communities they want access to. Do you want to attend a small school with a low student-to-faculty ratio or a large school with a plethora of opportunities? Are you interested in conducting lab research or are you more focused on the classroom experience? Will you thrive in a city or a rural setting? A student’s college list should be reflective of their answers to these questions and thus tailored to their needs and goals—both personal and academic.

A student who approaches their college list in this way will almost certainly not craft a list that includes all eight Ivy Leagues. While Dartmouth students are minutes away from hiking and skiing opportunities in rural New Hampshire, Columbia undergraduates have New York City’s entertainment and internships at their immediate disposal. Harvard offers students a highly traditional and structured academic environment. Meanwhile, Brown is known for its Open Curriculum and its diverse, creative, and interdisciplinary approach to education—one that is best suited for students who gravitate toward multiple different disciplines or want to think outside the box. As a land-grant institution, Cornell attracts students who are community minded and who want to use their learning to benefit not only the college but also Ithaca’s tight-knit community, while UPenn is known for graduating students who have a global mindset and are prepared to enter the upper echelons of their professions. In other words, students should not regard Ivy League schools as synonymous with “elite education,” but should instead weigh their interest in each individual school based on its programs, culture, and unique offerings.

2. Applying to All Eight Schools Doesn’t Increase Your Odds of Admission

It’s a common misconception that applying to all eight Ivy League schools will improve your chances of acceptance to at least one. First and foremost, students should note that applying to eight schools, all with single-digit acceptance rates, does nothing to increase their odds at any single one of them. On the contrary, it actually detracts from a student’s overall odds of admission by overloading their college list with reach schools at the expense of matches and safeties. That is to say, students are hedging their bets at schools where they face overwhelming odds of rejection (even if they are highly qualified), rather than balancing their list with schools that they are more likely to earn acceptance to.

Additionally, each Ivy League school has its own specific admissions criteria—just as every Ivy League school is not a fit for every student, every student is not a fit for every Ivy League school. A standout Ivy League application is meticulously tailored to demonstrate a student’s unique qualifications for a specific institution. Students who apply to all eight schools often cut corners, overgeneralize their reasons for applying, or tailor their answers to what they assume “Ivy League admissions officers” want to hear—all of which can negatively impact their chances of acceptance. Those who truly wish to attend a given Ivy League school should focus dedicated energy on leveling up their application materials to the particular school that aligns with their authentic interests and goals and ensure that they are putting their best foot forward in their materials.

3. Hyper-Focusing on the Ivy League Can Distract You from Better Matches

If you are applying to all eight Ivy League schools simply because of their prestige, not only will you likely craft inauthentic and unimpressive applications, but you will also miss out on other great schools that may be a better fit for you. Remember that rankings and low admissions rates are not the only measures of a school’s rigor and excellence. Rather than devoting countless hours to writing supplemental essays for every Ivy League school, you should spend your time researching a diversity of schools that house strong programs in your intended area of study. If you are interested in STEM, for instance, you might find that CalTech or UT Austin’s innovative and forward-thinking programs are a better fit for you than Harvard’s traditional option.

Ultimately, students should not apply to all eight Ivy League institutions—or any school—just for the sake of applying or because of the prestige associated with earning an acceptance. At the same time, students can gain strategic insights from the inspiring students who were accepted to all eight Ivies. How did some of the students deciding between all of the Ivies make their choice? In 2014, Kwasi Enin chose Yale after visiting the campus and enjoying the school’s residential college system and friendly student body. Craig McFarland originally chose Yale, but changed his plans when the pandemic forced him to reprioritize having a support system nearby, leading him to choose Harvard. Ashley Adirika—a Florida teen who was accepted to all eight Ivies in 2022—made her decision based on the strength of Harvard’s academic offerings in her field of interest: “[W]hen I did further research for what I want to do specifically, which is explorations in policy and social policy and things of that nature, Harvard just had a better program.”"

 COURTESY OF CANOPY

“We were just not really thinking of the problems in a holistic way,” said Nicole Rycroft, founder and executive director of Canopy, a solutions-oriented non-profit that works to save the world’s forests. “There was this shift from plastic packaging to paper packaging, which is akin to trading one environmental disaster for another one, plastic pollution for deforestation.”

Three billion trees are cut down each year to make paper packaging, Rycroft said, noting that Patagonia, has made a commitment to use wood-alternatives in its packaging, including Next Generation materials such as materials made from waste.

“Patagonia is often part of a catalytic spark,” Rycroft said of the company, which was one of the first four brands to sign up with the organization in 2013. Patagonia has developed and formalized its commitment. It’s committed at least from the textile side, to eliminating old tree fibers altogether.

“What we see embedded in the Pack4Good journey is a commitment to the next step which is, fundamentally, striving to be more circular and ensuring that none of their operations is impacting the world’s forests,” said Rycroft. “The majority of Patagonia’s packaging is already 100% recycled paper, that’s their catalogs, their hangtags, their packaging. Under Pack4Good, they’re ensuring there’s smart design and that they can diversify the fiber basket.”

There are over 400 companies signed up for Pack4Good. Rycroft works with individual brands to find custom solutions. For example, Canopy helped Champagne company Veuve Clicquot redevelop its Eco- Yellow Label box and shifted it from being 100% virgin fiber to being 50% hemp and 50% recycled content.

Because of hemp’s qualities Veuve Clicquot was able to make the box 12% lighter. Hemp has broader efficiencies in fiber as well as it’s helpful for transportation. It’s good for transportation because it reduces the weight of products.

Patagonia is innovating, too. Whether it’s agricultural residues like wheat straw, which has excellent qualities for making packaging, or longer fibers like hemp, Patagonia is sending a signal to its supply chain that it has zero tolerance for frittering away the earth’s forests.

“As part of our goal to build the best product and constantly improve everything we do, we’re taking steps to review and develop new, more responsible packaging materials in partnership with Canopy,” said Jennifer Patrick, packaging and branding director of Patagonia.

Canopy has been educating brands. “Back in 2013 most brands weren’t aware that viscose and rayon textiles originated from the world’s forests,” Rycroft said, adding that the campaign initiative has 550 brands that represent $1.7 trillion in sales. “Because those brands have sent a really consistent message through their supply chains, 71% of global viscose producers have taken action to shift their exposure from high risk sourcing to low risk sourcing.

“We have these solutions, it’s just a question of mobilizing the investment and bringing it to scale and making sure member companies are aware of them and are able to pull them through to their inventory,” Rycroft said. “There’s no shortage of solutions. Patagonia is ensuring that viscose and rayon textiles don’t originate from endangered forests. Now, they’re ensuring that their paper-based packaging does not.”

Rather than have any reliance on forests, Patagonia is looking to play a significant role in kick-starting the Next Generation of solutions of fibers that have a smaller footprint. There’s mountains of straw left over after the harvest, which can actually be monetized and in doing so can help revitalize rural areas. “When it gets to the pulp mill, there’s an average of 4 tons less carbon per ton of product for packaging made from straw versus that made from trees and forests. There’s also up to 60% less water used, and five times less impact on biodiversity,” Rycroft said."

[+]

IMAZINS VIA GETTY IMAGES

RM is the leader of BTS, but when it comes to the members’ individual careers, he’s still catching up to some of his bandmates. He’s known for taking creative risks and trying new things when it comes to his solo output, which means he isn’t necessarily the most commercially successful name from the septet. RM does manage to score a very important new hit this week in America as he joins one of the biggest rappers on the planet.

This week, “Neva Play” brings RM back to the Hot 100, which is a major feat for a musician who has missed the ranking several times in the past with his own singles. The BTS singer and rapper has now placed two tracks under his solo moniker on Billboard’s ranking of the most-consumed songs in the U.S., and his latest win is especially meaningful.

RM joins Megan Thee Stallion on her new single, which was released a little more than a week ago. This frame, “Neva Play” launches at No. 36 on the Hot 100, immediately becoming a smash on what is known as the most competitive ranking of tracks in the country.

“Neva Play” now ranks as RM’s first top 40 hit on the Hot 100 as a soloist. The collaboration also stands as his highest-ever placement on the tally.

Before “Neva Play” arrived, RM had only sent his tune “Wild Flower,” a duet with Youjeen, to the Hot 100. That song peaked at No. 83 in late 2022, and it only managed a single frame on the list before falling away for good.

RM is one of several members of BTS to collect at least two Hot 100 hits aside from his work with the group. He joins Jung Kook, Jimin, J-Hope, and V, who have all scored a minimum of a pair of appearances on the roster.

“Neva Play” is also a quick hit on a number of other Billboard charts, in addition to the Hot 100. The track launches at No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales ranking with what must be a sizable opening sales sum. The tune also starts its time on both the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales and Rap Digital Song Sales lists in first place.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

On Tuesday, Instagram announced it was going to set teenager accounts to private by default. A recent sextortion case on the platform, one of many to have plagued Instagram over recent years, highlights why Meta has felt the need to lock down accounts owned by younger users.

A Virginia man was charged in May this year with carrying out a sextortion campaign over Instagram and Kik Messenger, using a real-life porn actress’ photos to trick as many as 60 victims into sharing nude images, previously-unreported court records show.

Gary Owens Jr. has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which allege he grabbed online photos of the porn star, who now lives in Florida, and convinced victims he was a real young teenage woman named Jessica Lincon who wanted to engage in a sexual relationship with them. The government did not say why Owens was doing it other than to trick victims into producing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) for him.

After the cops searched Owens’ iPad, they discovered Google searches for the adult entertainment actress and evidence he’d visited porn sites to view images of the porn star, as well as hundreds of photos and videos of her undressed or performing sex acts. Investigators also found over 900 images of “males in some stage of undress or engaged in a sex act,” according to a search warrant.

Forbes understands the actress has not been contacted by law enforcement regarding the use of her photos. She did not respond to requests for comment and Forbes is withholding publishing her name. From online discussions amongst porn enthusiasts, it appears the actress has removed many of her videos and photos from popular adult content aggregators as well as an OnlyFans page.

The government gathered evidence indicating Owens operated his sextortion campaign from 2021 through to 2024. In its criminal complaint against the defendant, the government said it had identified 13 minors as definitive victims, but said “there are at least 51 additional potential victims that have not yet been fully identified."" In the search warrant, filed after the complaint, the FBI said it had identified more than 30 minor victims and was continuing to investigate. A trial is due to go ahead in early 2025.

Kik Messenger owner MediaLab.ai didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment on the case, but pointed Forbes to its new protections against sextortion. In announcing Instagram Teen Accounts on Tuesday, the Meta site said not only will teenage users be set to private, meaning they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to, those under 16 will need their parent’s permission to use less protective settings.

Dawn Hawkins, CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, praised Meta for taking “a tremendous step forward to ensuring minors are better protected from harm by defaulting teen accounts to private.”

“Instagram has been a leader in facilitating harm to minors – it’s been the top platform where perpetrators have threatened to and have actually distributed sextortion images,” Hawkins added. “We are grateful that Meta has acted on our concerns to ensure that accounts belonging to teens 16 and younger are defaulted to the highest safety settings.”

Why Ex-Intel Agents Think Hezbollah Pagers Started Exploding Amid Suspicions Of Israel Hack

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

An ex-IDF agent and a former NSA analyst tell Forbes that it’s unlikely Israel carried out an entirely remote hack to make Hezbollah pagers explode, as they did en masse on Tuesday. Instead, they suspect the devices were intercepted, tampered with and sent on to Hezbollah operatives before being set off. It’s not a particularly difficult piece of sabotage to pull off either, requiring some rudimentary hacking skills and explosive materials that could be bought off Amazon, the ex-analysts say.

CrowdStrike disputed the reporting, blaming “disgruntled former employees” for the allegations, though Semafor said it spoke to numerous ex-staffers who left of their own accord.
