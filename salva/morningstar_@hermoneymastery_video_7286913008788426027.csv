Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Amy Arnott: And I’m Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Anne Lester. She’s author of a new book called Your Best Financial Life: Save Smart Now for the Future You Want. Before writing the book, Anne spent 20 years as head of retirement solutions for J.P. Morgan. With AARP, she co-founded The Aspen Leadership Forum on Retirement Savings. In 2020, Anne was recognized for her extraordinary lifetime contributions to Americans’ economic security with the Ray Lillywhite Award. She earned a master’s in international economics and Japan studies from Johns Hopkins University and a B.A. from Princeton. She was also awarded a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship.

Anne, welcome to The Long View.

Anne Lester: Well, thank you so much for having me.

Benz: Well, we’re excited to have you here and congratulations on the book, Your Best Financial Life. Maybe you can talk about your motivation for writing the book.

Lester: Thanks so much. I think there were a couple of different things motivating me. I guess for starters, I’ve always wanted to write a book and in fact have an unpublished novel I wrote in my 20s and 30s in the bottom of a desk drawer somewhere. So, it’s been a lifelong ambition. I guess I listened to the “write what you know” advice. So, I certainly know this topic pretty well. And I know it from several different perspectives. One, obviously as an investment professional who spent 20-plus years focusing on how to build investment products for people to help them save for retirement. But also from a very personal perspective, I found a lot of what I was learning about is I really dove into the defined-contribution system very personal because I was a textbook example of all of the mistakes people make when they’re trying to save themselves— maybe not so much on the investing side, but certainly on the saving side. So I think I’m writing this book maybe for my younger self, but also very much for my children and for frankly, everybody I talked to along the way, working on this book who really is struggling often to overcome not just the realities of saving, which are challenging, but also their own personal feelings of maybe shame and fear and the little voice in their head that says, you should do a better job at this. So that’s why I wrote the book.

Arnott: So, I think you partially answered our next question, which is why did you focus your book on a younger audience, mainly millennials and Gen Z versus people who are getting ready to retire or already retired, for example.

Lester: Again, there are multiple reasons, but a big one is—and I don’t mean this to discourage anybody who is older—but if you’re in your 50s or 60s and have not started saving yet, it’s a really different conversation than it is with a 30-year-old who hasn’t started saving yet. And so, part of it is just—I don’t want to say easy because none of this is easy—but it’s a less challenging, maybe less sacrificial conversation when you’re younger because you do have time. And time is your friend when you’re in your 20s and 30s. When you’re in your 50s and 60s, time is, from an investing perspective, certainly much less of a friend. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons. The other reason is, again with children this age, I hear and see so much—I don’t know, nihilism or fear or “we’ll never be able to do it.” And I just don’t think that’s true. So, another one was really trying to dispel that fear.

Benz: It seems like a lot of people have tried to crack this nut with books and websites, trying to help younger people with their financial wellness. And I’m wondering if you can think about what you view as your “secret sauce” or what are you trying to do differently than other entities that have tried to address the same audience and the same general topic?

Lester: Well, clearly, we’re not getting it right because I don’t think the savings rates—the proof is in the pudding and it’s not all that great. And as you say, there are many, many, many books out there like this. I think I’m trying to do two things that are maybe a little different. The first is, approach it—it’s basically integrating the behavioral, the why with the how. And I think there are lots of books on the why and a lot of books that take a deep dive into the behavioral economics and the importance of it for personal finance. But I don’t know that many books have successfully integrated the why of the wiring and the how you do it as explicitly as I’ve done. So that’s one big differentiator.

The second big differentiator is I think—and I am one of them—financial-services professionals tend to get stuck in jargon. I think we assume that this stuff is interesting. And I think most people don’t find it the least little bit interesting. They just want it all to go away, and I think they can, without intending to, sound condescending. And so, I really tried very hard to sound approachable, relatable, human, not to use jargon, but also, and I think there are plenty of great books that have come out very recently aimed at this demographic written by people this age, I think those books are a, “Hey, I’ve done it all right and I can teach you to do it, too.” I’m taking kind of a different approach, which was, “Wow, I made every mistake you made, and I’ve learned a lot. And let me share that with you from the perspective of someone who has made the mistakes and learned, but also from the perspective of someone who spent 30 years as a professional investor.” And so, I think that’s a bit differentiated as well.

Arnott: What are some of the key areas where you depart from the conventional wisdom about how this group of younger investors should be managing their finances?

Lester: I think at a high level, I am trying very hard to make sure that people don’t feel—I don’t want to say don’t feel responsibility, because clearly, we’re responsible for what we do—but don’t feel like it’s their fault. So, one of my chapters is called, “You Suck at Savings and It’s Not Your Fault.” And I actually mean that. Surely, you are the one spending the money, so you are actually spending the money, and we can’t pretend that you’re not doing it. But at the same time, I think unlocking the appreciation and the understanding of the why. Why are you spending like this? What is causing you to spend like this? And I think there is an argument to be made that— and I know there’s a new field of financial therapists that I think are very helpful in this context—but while I think everybody should spend years plumbing the depths of the why’s on a very personal and human level, I think there are also some great shortcuts you can take that let you hack your way around some of the triggers that may cause overspending or make it difficult to start investing. And you can do that first and then you can take the time to really go deep on the why for your own personal sense of knowledge and control. But I think accepting that you may be wired a certain way is certainly one way to get out of this frozen shame/blame place that I think a lot of people are in. I heard so many people say to me, “I just don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of doing it wrong. This is really confusing. It will never work for me.” Those are all stories that loop through people’s heads that stop them from taking action.

Benz: We want to delve into some of the things that you just referenced, Anne. But first, you have two sons who are in the same age cohort as your intended audience. I’m wondering, did they influence how you approach the subject matter in the book and perhaps why you wanted to write a book geared toward this audience in the first place?

Lester: Oh, very much so. I think I say it in the acknowledgments or at the back of the book that I was very grateful for them being my focus group of two to begin with. And I think what I really learned from them is—and you read about it in the media, but certainly talking to them—I consider them reasonably media-sophisticated, engaged people. And there is a level of cynicism and skepticism about the system and what to expect from the grown-ups that is radically different. Maybe people felt like that in the ‘60s when they were that age. I’m a generation almost younger than that, so I didn’t feel that. But just this skepticism and “it will never work for me” is so pervasive. And I think some of that is obviously the environment we’re in and two pretty large systemic failures, most importantly, the great financial crisis. But also, I think when you’re young, compound returns don’t make sense. You don’t get a visceral understanding for how that works. And I do think that some of the young inability to trust that it will work, which we’ve damaged in all kinds of ways with systemic failures from leadership, and I think that’s a challenge for all of us in this society. It’s just a much lower level of trust in institutions. But specifically for the younger people, when you put money on top of it, I think it’s so difficult for your brain to understand the power of compound interest unless you’re a math geek. That math really, really, really works. It’s very powerful, but you need to let your money grow for 10 or 20 years before you really see how powerful it is. And that, I think, is an insight that I really hope people take from my book.

The single most important thing that somebody in their 20s or 30s has is time. And it is truly magic for what it will do for your future. But it’s hard to take that on faith and you have no personal experience in it until you’re out 20 years later, and then you can look back and go, “Wow, that worked,” or, “Oh, I wish I had.” I want them not to say, “I wish I had.”

Arnott: In addition to talking to your own sons, you also conducted some focus groups of younger adults to help prepare for the book. What was the purpose of those focus groups and what kinds of topics did you cover with them?

Lester: Well, I did, with the help of a company, a bunch of surveys where I really wanted just to get a sense for how people thought they were doing saving for retirement and how they actually were doing saving for retirement. So, we sent this out in the summer of 2021 and got a lot of data about savings rates and attitudes and stuff. And when we looked at it, it was very clear that people really fell into four buckets, again, aligned on this: How are you doing versus how do you think you’re doing? And it was fascinating looking at—and everybody I surveyed was between the ages of 21 and 45, all income levels, all education levels. And the group that was doing well and knew it, really skewed very heavily male and also skewed very heavily—and I really dove into this in the focus groups—I called them the cryptonauts. They were really into money. They were geeking out on the data. They were on all the social media and internet sites and giving each other tips. Again, I called them cryptonauts because that’s what was going on back then. But they were giving each other tips on day-trading and were kind of geeking out on this stuff. And the only woman in the focus group who we could recruit, because again, we were trying to match the demographics of the thousand people when we recruited the focus group. So, we got similar age, similar income distribution, and similar gender mixes. And the only woman had been taught how to do this by her grandfather, but everybody in that group had a mentor, a financial mentor, who taught them how to do it.

And then the other three groups were also fascinating. About 50% of the people were not doing well and knew it. And then the other, about 35% of the people were almost evenly split between the other two groups—the ones who were doing just fine based on their self-reported savings and investments, but thought they weren’t. So, they were the worried well—skewed very female, didn’t have a lot of mentorship, didn’t have a lot of understanding but were just really good savers. And then to me, the most interesting group from my former hat as running target-date funds, was the group that thought they were doing just fine and were not at all based on their self-reported savings, were saving way too little. And I knew this before I left J.P. Morgan. But the single scariest thing I heard them say was, “Well, we know we’re doing fine because our company enrolled us in the 401(k).” And then when we probed and said, “How much are you saving? How do you know it’s enough?” They said, “I don’t know how much I’m saving, but the company did it. So, I know it’s right.” That was answer number one. Terrifying, right? If you’re an auto-enroller and you haven’t been auto-escalating, that is terrifying.

And then the second answer that also I found troubling, especially in this sort of internet age is, “I know I’m doing everything right because I’m doing what everybody else around me is doing.” And both of those really give me pause, because if you’re gauging success on everybody else— and again, I see this now on social media—there’s a lot of really good stuff on social media about finances. But you know what? There’s also a lot of not-so-good stuff out there. And if you’re not very sophisticated about this stuff, it’s pretty hard to tell it apart sometimes. So, that is troubling. And clearly the ones either they were listening to people who were equally ill-informed, or they were listening to people who were giving them actively bad advice—and I couldn’t tell in the focus groups which one it was—but it was troublesome.

Benz: In the book, you talk about how people in their 20s and 30s today are actually pretty good savers based on the data, despite the widespread perception that they’re spenders on avocado toast and whatever else. Can you talk about that?

Lester: I haven’t seen the data on that. But my suspicion is that’s almost entirely due to auto-enrollment. And certainly, a lot of the data around this is for retirement. If you compare them to the boomers, the boomers didn’t even have 401(k) plans when they were entering the workforce, and they certainly weren’t getting auto-enrolled. So, I think for younger workers who start in a company that offers a 401(k), I’d say most of them are now getting auto-enrolled. Many of them are now getting auto-escalated. And certainly, when I talk to people in this age bracket, what I hear is,

“I’m really worried. I’m not doing it right. I’m not doing enough.”

And I say, “Are you in your 401(k) plan?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know how much?”

“I’m not sure. I think 10%. I need to check.”

And I’m like, “You’re doing OK.”

There are some things we can check. There are some things we can do. But if you’re in and started in your 25 or 30 even, you’re on the right path. So, some of that anxiety and fear is because they’re hearing it everywhere as much as actually having any, like, “I know I’m doing it wrong.” In fact, a lot of them are doing it pretty well. They just need to be reassured, frankly.

Arnott: You also talk about some of the headwinds for young adults who are just getting started with their financial lives, including the fact that the cost of college has gone up so much. What are some of the key challenges for people in this age group?

Lester: I think there’s several. One is that we’re in overall a more affluent society than certainly society was when I graduated from college in 1986. Social media makes it a lot easier to see what your peers are doing. And I think there is a bit of norm-setting that happens when you see everybody else doing it and you think you should be doing it too. It is also true that the median price of housing, whether you’re renting or buying, versus the median salary is significantly higher. The median price of a car is significantly higher versus the median salary. So, a couple of really big-ticket items that most people anchor on as signs of, “I’m an adult now because…” are really more expensive. We lose a little sight over the fact that they’re also probably a lot nicer. And some of that increase in cost is actually reflecting a much wealthier society. So, the car that you buy now is nicer and safer, the house that you buy or the apartment that you rent is probably per-square-foot bigger than what I would have gotten in my age, certainly nicer. So, it’s not quite apples to apples in terms of what you’re getting for the money. So, I think that’s just true.

And then I also think because society overall is more affluent, people are more uncomfortable struggling with stuff. I don’t want to sound like a cranky old boomer who says, “Oh, kids these days,” because it’s more than that. It really is more than that, these big-ticket items being one of them, and to get the same level of external achievement is just harder. But it’s also, I think, a more affluent society really struggling with a lifetime income curve. And it takes a while to have your salary increase to the level that you grew up with. I had this conversation with one of my kids who was saying, “I’ll never be able to afford what you and dad had.” And that may be true, especially for my child who is a musician.

He said, “We’ll never take nice trips.”

And I was like, “Honey, do you remember the vacations we took all the way through middle school?”

And he’s like, “What do you mean?”

We always used to see their great grandmother for spring break. And I said, “Remember where we stayed where dad and I used to pull the mattress off the sleeper sofa in the living room because it was so uncomfortable. We couldn’t sleep on the sofa bed, and we gave you guys the bedroom.”

And he’s like, “Yeah, I love that place.”

And I was like, “Well, let’s talk about how fancy a vacation that was.”

It wasn’t; it was like negatively fancy. Or the apartments we used to rent at the beach with no screens on the windows and mosquitoes. And they don’t remember any of that. They’re anchoring on the nicest bit of our life that happened when I was in my 50s. So, some of it, I think, is just that comparison too that people lose sight of.

But I don’t mean to derail this. I do think that because those big-ticket items, whether it’s colleges and debt, certainly starting off with debt is something that the boomers did not do to the same degree. College was just much more affordable. So, you’re starting in the hole from a debt perspective. Those big-ticket items that you view as milestone achievements are coming later because they cost more.

Benz: Anne, you mentioned the comparisons, people comparing themselves. I wonder if you can touch on the role of social media in that where it seems like younger people, especially are comparing their vacation or their wedding or their house to their peers and often coming up feeling pretty bad about themselves. So maybe you can talk about that dimension and whether that came out in your focus-group discussions.

Lester: When I was running the focus groups, what I was really curious about is where people got financial information and certainly the overwhelming source of financial information was social media. If I knew then what I know now, I would have maybe probed a little more about that sort of lifestyle anchoring and that sort of normalization of what “everybody is doing it” kind of a thing. And again, I think when you’re younger, peer influence is so important and it’s so hard to not get swept along. I just saw an article today—and I’ve been following this trend myself for the last six weeks since it kind of bubbled up—about loud budgeting and being really public about saying I’m trying to save money.

So, there’s an example of social media actually being a really healthy way to use your peer group to affirm healthy behavior and normalize not spending money because everybody else is. The article started with somebody saying, “I canceled my milestone birthday trip to London because I don’t have the money.” And I’m like, what, 30 years old and you’re taking a milestone trip to... what?? So, that’s what I was referring to before, this sort of normalization of luxury spending, I think is very attributable to social media. It used to be that you’d see Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous once a week on TV and now it’s just in your feed constantly. So, you have this aspirational level of spending normalizing things like weddings. Well, of course you have to have X, Y, Z; of course, it has to be a wedding weekend and not just an event. It just normalizes stuff. And then you see your peer group starting to do some of those things. And then suddenly it’s the new normal. So, I think that’s very detrimental. But also, some good stuff on there like the loud budgeting.

Arnott: One recurrent theme we noticed in the book is the idea of getting out of the shame spiral, not berating yourself because you didn’t start saving earlier or made some financial mistakes along the way. Was that something that came out of the focus groups that young people are beating up on themselves and maybe getting in their own way because they feel bad about previous mistakes?

Lester: Not really. I think maybe I gather that more in one-on-one conversations and maybe that’s just telling you a little bit about myself. I certainly felt that way, and I think all the research that we read about losing weight or trying to overcome habits, the script that starts playing in your head about “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t,” I think that came much more from there. But I have seen and felt and heard when I’m having one-on-one conversations with people of any age, when I mentioned that, you can just see their posture change. Somebody had tears well up in their eyes. This one young woman I was talking to when she asked me if she was doing OK, I said, “Yeah, you’re doing fine. And she actually had tears in her eyes, and she said, “Oh, thank you. I never know if I’m good enough or doing it well enough.” To some extent maybe this goes back to social media as well and maybe to some trends I’m seeing playing out just with younger people—feeling like the stakes are very high for them all the time. I don’t think I felt like that when I was their age that I have to get into the right school, I have to get the right job, I have to do this right otherwise something terrible will happen. I’m not sure what the terrible thing is. But this just constant fear of failure and stress, which just seems to be dimensionally different than I recall it being.

Benz: Do you sense that people in this age cohort feel a little more comfortable talking about money than previous generations did? And if so, do you think that’s a healthy development? You talked about how your parents didn’t talk much about money at all really at home and how that influenced your thinking a little bit as you were starting out.

Lester: I think so. I think things like the salary transparency—a woman whose name I’m blanking on on TikTok who just asked people what they’re making—and people are saying that this loud budgeting. I think it’s something I’m hearing in the financial-services community. Financial advisors are getting more comfortable asking their clients about their money stories. I think all of this is healthy. I think again because so many people feel like they should know—I hate the word should—they should know more about personal finances; they should be doing better; they should be whatever. And I think many families either feel reluctant to talk about their money because they’re worried that people will think they have a lot and they don’t want their kids talking about, look, how much money we have and bragging. Or, and I think much more commonly, feel ashamed because they are struggling with money, and they don’t want their kids to know that there are hard conversations happening. I can’t remember if I put this in the book or not and I can’t remember the stat over my head, but something like 70% of parents would rather talk about sex education with their kids than money. It’s a really high percent would rather talk about the thing we all think is really uncomfortable than talk about money. So, there’s clearly a lot of shame associated with it, otherwise we would be happy to talk about it.

Arnott: So, in the book you share a lot of helpful hacks and tips and tricks for young people who are looking to get their savings programs on track. Can you share some of those ideas?

Lester: So, the biggest one, and this is straight out of the 401(k) playbook is just automate everything. Automate the money going into the savings account, automate the investing, automate the escalation if you can, like you keep saving more and some 401(k) plans will let you do that, some won’t. It’s the single most powerful thing you can do. And then put it in a place, put your money, put your emergency savings. I think making sure it’s not really easy to see and get is also really important, and if you’re saving into an IRA or 401(k), it’s kind of hard to get back out. A, you have to do a request and it’s a thing, but also you pay these tax penalties, which is uncomfortable. So, that’s a safe place for your money longer term and in a true, true, true, true emergency—and I talk a little bit about that in the book, you can get it back, but it makes it very hard. I think having money sitting in a savings account that’s on the same home screen as your regular bank account is asking for trouble. So, getting it out of sight I think is a very powerful thing.

I think the other really important hack that I talk about is again right out of the 401(k) playbook, which is save more tomorrow. Make sure that you continue increasing the amount you save as your lifestyle gets better as you earn more money. Because if you don’t do that, you will not be saving enough. But it’s so painful to increase your savings rate today because you have to stop spending money. The younger you are, the more likely you are to see meaningful income increases as you get more experience and become more valuable as an employee, and so at least for the first 10 or 20 years of your working life you can probably count on seeing some pretty consistent increases in your salary and that’s the great way to get your savings rate up.

Benz: One mental trick that you shared in the book to help limit spending is to add a zero to whatever purchase you’re contemplating, and I thought that was such a useful way of framing it. Can you talk about that mental trick?

Lester: So, it’s really something that came about because my husband and I are serial rehabbers, and we overbuy houses that need a lot of work and then spend decades rehabbing them. So, we’re living in an old house that we spent 13 years fixing up and for a while we were looking at replacing a bunch of windows, which is really not very cheap. And I was changing the unit of money—every time I thought about spending some money, I’d say, well, that’s a window, better not do it. Having a handy thing that keeps your eye on what you’re trying to achieve is so powerful. So, we were thinking about buying—this is back in the early 2000s—buying a big screen TV, and I was like, well, that’s going to be two windows. No, we can’t, we don’t need a new TV. I want those windows. Then it was like, well, how does that translate into retirement? And I want to be able to live another six months without running out of savings. That doesn’t work. I want to be able to buy a boat. No, that doesn’t work either. And then it was like, well, it’s just how much more money is it? Because let’s assume you earn a 7% return, that money doubles every 10 years. In 30 or 40 years, it is 10 times;10 times the amount, and that’s fast math you can do.

Arnott: One of the other challenges that people face as they’re just starting out is how to prioritize building an emergency fund versus saving for retirement or paying down student loan debt. You outline a hierarchy for prioritizing those three objectives. Can you talk about that a little more?

Lester: I’ve seen people who use a similar hierarchy, I’ve seen different ones. And for me, it really boils down to—and maybe this is again coming out of my career—risk management and really avoiding the really, really bad outcomes. So, really, really bad outcomes are outcomes that push you into financial crisis or bankruptcy. So, to me the number-one priority is to really focus on building up your emergency fund because that is what’s going to keep you financially healthy, when you don’t have to run up credit card debt, when you need to replace your tires or hit a pothole—whatever the thing is, coming up with that $1,000, $2,000—you lose your job. So, emergency fund even more important than retirement.

But what if you have an employer who offers a matching 401(k) program? You also really want the free money. So, to me, if you don’t have a 401(k) plan and you only have to do this by yourself, you should just focus on your emergency savings first and then start working on your retirement savings. If you do have a 401(k) or a 403(b), or some other kind of workplace savings program, and you get matching from your employer, then you need to start working on both simultaneously. After you have at least three months of emergency fund—and again, I talk about in the book how you should think about three to six months. And if you are in a volatile industry, if you’re self-employed, if you know you’re in an economic environment that may make you more prone to a layoff, you might want to lean more toward six months. If you are a government employee and very unlikely to get fired, maybe you can do the three months. And you’re getting all of the free money from your employer. You get the full match from your employer, maybe not maxing out, maybe not at the target savings amount you want to get to, but at least getting the full match, then I think it’s very appropriate to turn your attention to paying down high interest-rate debt. So that is debt with—it’s a little bit arbitrary, like more than you would get investing the money in your 401(k) plan. I picked 8%. We could argue about is that 7%, is that 10%, but it’s 8%. You want to pay that down as fast as you can. And you want to continue making payments on the low-interest rate debt, which might be federal student loans or other kinds of debt under that 8% level. But you really want to get rid of that high interest-rate debt stuff first.

Benz: We wanted to switch over to discuss investing. I was struck by your investment recommendations in the book. You’re pretty unequivocal about keeping things simple with target-date funds or perhaps a three-index fund portfolio. I’m curious, was it liberating to be able to provide such clear-cut advice to tell people to just buy a basket of Vanguard index funds, for example, since you’re no longer working for an asset manager?

Lester: No, I don’t think so. To me, again, it goes back to how is somebody going to spend their mental and emotional energy. The first thing I recommend is target-date funds, because guess what, I used to manage target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in active management as well. It’s hard to pick active managers because, especially in US equities, most managers don’t outperform. So, it requires time and emotional energy and a process and a lot of skill. So, I just think that’s asking an enormous amount of individuals. And at the end of the book, I do go into some tips for investing and say, “Look, if you think you’ve got the time, the energy, and the skill, then go for it.” It’s fun. I did it for a long time. I think it’s fun. But most people don’t think this stuff is fun. Most people don’t have the process or the—discipline, starts putting it into judge-y territory—just the time and the energy to spend doing it in a process that they can repeat. And I think unless you’re going to do it that way, you’re really better off not doing it at all and making it as simple as possible because the payoff for the incremental amount of emotional and intellectual energy you need to spend on this is uncertain.

Arnott: Do you think there’s a tendency on Wall Street to make investing seem more complicated than it really is or needs to be? And what’s the motivation behind that?

Lester: I’ve thought this for years that one of the main challenges for the financial-services industry when we talk to our clients is that we think this stuff is fun and interesting. Because guess what? Most of America, like I said before, just wants the whole thing to go away. Just tell me I’m going to be OK and make it go away. I don’t like this. It’s uncertain. If you make me think about saving for retirement, it’s unpleasant because I’m denying myself stuff I want right now. It’s volatile. You can’t promise me it’s going to work. And oh, by the way, I’m going to die at the end of this. Why should I like this experience? There’s nothing good about it if you don’t happen to think this stuff is intellectually interesting.

So, I think a huge part of the challenge is the industry is populated with people who geek out on this stuff and sometimes struggle to understand why clients don’t share our enthusiasm. So, right out of the gate, we’re like, we’re a mismatch of the intellectual starting point and then the vocabulary that we’re using. I think some of it is regulation in that those of us who are still subject to securities licenses have to be extraordinarily precise about how we say things, which makes us sound squirrely, frankly, when we’re talking because you can’t just say stuff. You have to qualify it all the time. And then you have to use very precise language, which also is very unrelatable. And I may have told you this ages ago, Christine, back in my former life where it took us a huge amount of effort to get regulatory and compliance people to allow us to use clip art to show the risks on the target-date funds for J.P. Morgan. How about saying this is a risky investment and putting that red circle with a line through it. That is pretty clear. Well, it took us months to get them comfortable using stuff that was that obvious and every time you get some industry move toward simplifying some of this stuff, something happens, and it gets pulled back the other way. So, some of that is self-inflicted. And then, yes, I will finally say that I do think that maybe some people—I’ve seen it happen—enjoy being mysterious and knowledgeable and being seen as experts. And when you want to be seen as an expert, you tend to lean in hard to jargon and sophistication that doesn’t help somebody understand very well. But I don’t think that’s all of the story.

Benz: I want to ask about financial advice and whether in the focus groups you got any clues as to how younger age bands are thinking about financial advice. You mentioned that they have widespread skepticism about the industry and the system. But any feedback on financial advice and the willingness of younger people to hire financial advisors and pay for them?

Lester: It was a little depressing to be honest—depressing and not so depressing depending on the hat you’re wearing. So, I was actually quite encouraged to see that people were really willing to take financial advice from their parents. And I was like, really? Wow, that makes me feel better as a parent, like my kids are listening to me, I think to a greater extent than prior generations did. So, clearly, our maybe helicopter parenting is paying off in some regards. Our kids actually may listen to us a little more. But certainly, there was a very wide strand of being willing to listen to social media because I can trust my peers. And I don’t want to listen to financial-services institutions because they’re just trying to make money off me, which makes my head explode. Because it’s like, well, what do you think all those people on social media are doing? What’s their financial model? Help me to understand how you think—why are they doing this? Some people really are doing this from the bottom of the goodness of their hearts. But I think a lot of people are doing this to make money. And some of them are extremely transparent about it. So why do you trust them more than a regulated financial-services institution whose employees will go to jail if they do it wrong rather than somebody on YouTube? I don’t understand that.

This skepticism of the man and not being willing to understand how the social media ecosystem works with people being sensationalist to get clicks to sell advertising and get paid by brand management people. Or, and I think we saw this happen with the whole GameStop thing, maybe running a little pump-and-dump stuff, that’s just like, how do you think they’re making money? Why do you think they’re doing this? And that struck me as rather naive, to be honest. I was surprised at the naivety behind that. Isn’t everybody doing this somewhat motivated by money?

Arnott: So, we’ve talked a lot about the target audience for this book, younger investors in either generation Z or millennials.

Lester: If I could say younger noninvestors. The person I most hope picks this book up is somebody who doesn’t see themselves as that investor.

Arnott: That’s a great point. Thanks for clarifying that. But we’d also like to talk about parents who have young adult children or kids who are still growing up. What advice do you have for parents who are trying to help their children navigate their finances when they’re just starting out?

Lester: Aside from giving my book to their children? I mentioned this book earlier today and I thought, I need to see if it’s still in print. I don’t know. It’s a book called Money Doesn’t Grow on Trees. And I remember reading it when my kids were in preschool, maybe. And it gave such a sensible outline for—you want your kids to be able to be making good, rational financial decisions when they’re in high school. And you want to give them control over their money so that you can watch them spend money. And the author for this advocated actually having them spend clothing, all of it, besides housing, basically. And with two boys who really didn’t care what they looked like, I wasn’t willing to give them control over their clothing budget because I knew they just wouldn’t buy any. So, I have standards and they were not hitting them. But we really tried to do that.

One of the things that I really learned in my book that I knew was true from my own story, but I had been quite struck at how true it was for so many other people, just not having a place to learn about how money works. And I don’t mean investing, like becoming a stock investor. That’s great, too. And if you want to do that with your child, that’s a fabulous thing to do. But I mean really basic stuff. Like you have $10 a week in discretionary spending and depending on your own circumstances and where you live and beliefs, that might be for a middle school student that I don’t know, however old they are. But that’s your money. You decide how you spend it. Don’t ask me for anymore. Period. That is really going to teach them some lessons about money with training wheels on because you’ll be there to rescue them when something happens that takes them off the rails. And I think that that was the single most powerful thing I took away from my children.

My husband and I talked about that a lot and applied it to all kinds of things like internet usage and when do you have certain privileges? Like senior year in high school, all the boundaries have to be gone. So, you can really not discover this sophomore year, or worse yet, discover them in your first job. That’s a terrible time to figure out that you really need to do your homework. Don’t do that your first job. So that to me was the most powerful thing I could imagine. And some of that trickles through the book too. How do you put guardrails on yourself? I think if you’re a parent, how do you open conversations about money up? I think one thing that I was very conscious of in this book is how much easier it is to be vulnerable with someone if they’ve been vulnerable with you first. And that’s very much something I try to do in my book is to say, look, just because somebody’s got the expert label doesn’t mean they knew how to do everything once upon a time. And I think that can be very effective for parents.

Benz: In our remaining time, we’re hoping to mine your deep expertise in the retirement savings system. You were central to J.P. Morgan’s retirement efforts for a couple of decades. So, we wanted to talk about target-date funds, which you managed. And some of the work that you and your team did comparing target-date fund investors returns to those of retirement plan participants who were self-directed and picking their own fund from the menu. Can you talk about the findings there and what you see as the implications?

Lester: Actually, I don’t cite those directly in the book, but it certainly featured in, as you point out, my focus on simplicity. I think even professional investors get caught in the fear/greed cycle. And again, just going back to behavioral economics, there are so many triggers for assuming you’re right—having overconfidence in your views; thinking that when everything is going well, it will keep going well; feeling more confident about risking more money; investing more in higher-risk assets when everything is going well. And if you’re a professional investor, you’ve got a team of people who, A, are trained in understanding that this is the way their brains are working, and B, a whole bunch of models and rigor and peers who are working to factor that those biases into the way you actually implement decisions so that you are less likely to fall into those traps. I think when you look at that specific research we talked about—and it’s not just the work that J.P. Morgan published, but Dalbar publishes research like this every year, and Morningstar has done a lot of this research too, I should say—when you look at the way individuals trade in and out of things, whether they’re individual stocks or mutual funds in their own investment accounts or inside of 401(k) plans, they typically buy high and sell low over and over and over again, which is how you destroy wealth. Or they’re wrong risked. And by that, I mean they’re in their 60s or 70s—we saw a lot of this—and had 100% in equities, or they’re 20 and had 100% in cash. So those two things—buying high and selling low, because you buy more when it feels good and you sell when you’re worried—is the opposite of how you make money, and then just having just absolute wrong level of risk for the time horizon that you’ve got. And those two things I think are the biggest contributors to that gap you see in performance.

Arnott: You mentioned automatic enrollment and auto-escalation as both being two very positive things for younger employees just starting out. Do you think that there are other types of nudges that might help people from a behavioral standpoint?

Lester: It’s just starting now, and I don’t know if this goes into your nudge category, but certainly, the potential now to add two things, which are both coming out of the Secure legislation: to add emergency savings funds and have those be payroll-deducted is huge. And again, there has been a lot of research done on the—Brigitte Madrian and many, many others over the years—if you don’t have emergency savings, people go into their 401(k) plans and borrow more than they otherwise would, just because you want to take it as much as you can. Once you start borrowing, you tend to borrow more than you need. And if you have an emergency savings fund, you don’t tap into that. So, I think that that’s a nudge if you get automatically signed up for that emergency savings. That’s, again, so powerful because so many people don’t have emergency savings. In fact, this one young woman who was so worried about her retirement fund didn’t have any. She was contributing fabulously to her 401(k). She had no emergency savings. And I’m like, “Well, you’re doing fine for retirement, but get the match, dial that down, get your emergency savings set up because you don’t want to pull it out of your 401(k).”

And then the second one is the contributions when workers are putting stuff into student loan payoffs. I think, again, for so many people, student loans are so challenging. And the more help you can give people to feel good about paying off the student loans, the better. And I know a little bit less about this personally but seeing more financial wellness-type programs being integrated into the 401(k) system is another way to help people. I don’t know that the uptake on those is as high as it could be, and that’s going to be an interesting thing to watch as it evolves.

Benz: I wanted to ask about the retirement saving system broadly speaking. We know that younger age bands are more likely to job hop than older workers. They cycle through jobs seemingly every couple of years. So, given that young workers are changing jobs frequently, does tethering our retirement savings to our employers even make sense? Or should policymakers be contemplating something like thrift savings program for the masses that would be entirely detethered from employers?

Lester: I’m personally a huge fan of the Australian system where the employer is obligated to pick a default provider. The provider in the Australian system, the super system, is not a government provider. They’re private. They are managed by fiduciaries, not the employer. So, it’s a private provider. But the only obligation for the plan sponsor is to create a default if the individual does not choose a provider for themselves. Australia also has mandatory contributions. I also think that’s good if you want to have retirement savings for people. That’s a whole other conversation. But the individual can also choose their own provider. And if you don’t put in your provider when you get hired by a new employer, they put you in the default. But you can very easily roll these together. You can keep track of it on a single system. There’s a single dashboard in Australia that you can see everything on. And to me, that is the best of all worlds—where you’ve got a default, you’ve got a failsafe, but you also have the ability for the individual, if they choose to, to say, this is what I want. And then they can have that follow them around for their whole career. So, I think that’s incredibly powerful.

I know why it started that it was an employee benefit. That was the way our system evolved. I think in hindsight, nobody would create that system on purpose. And I think a system where you’ve got the ability to contribute to a single pool, that that pool is accessible from any employer or platform. Coming out of the industry, I do believe that a competitive, well-regulated, with appropriate oversight, private market is going to come up with innovations and probably have a more robust experience than a pure public-type system would like the federal thrift savings program. But I think there’s a lot to learn from how that works, assuming you can have the portability or the ability to tap into that wherever you want it.

Arnott: We just have a few minutes left here. We’d like to zoom out and talk a little bit about your own experience, both during retirement so far and during your career. You had a very high-profile position at J.P. Morgan and were well-regarded for your work there. We often hear that people can really feel a loss of identity when they step away from a career like that. Can you talk about whether you felt that? And if so, how did you cope with those feelings?

Lester: I didn’t feel that. Part of it is that we announced that I was leaving in March of 2020. And the world just kind of stopped revolving the following week. So, I suspect I would have felt that a little more acutely because that offboarding process would have been nine months long or whatever it was. It would have involved what would have felt like a perpetual goodbye party—I was going to go speak at conferences and visit clients and do a world tour, and all of that would have been gratifying and made me really conscious of what I was leaving. I didn’t leave anything except a really chaotic and unpleasant-sounding work situation, frankly. It just sounded really hard to navigate. And I just remember telling Dan Oldroyd, who was the person who took over and was my deputy, I just remember telling him I am so grateful I’m not in charge of any of this, sorry! I don’t have to worry about… because once you announce you’re leaving a job like I have—I was still there, and I was still engaged, and I was still part of the team, but I wasn’t actually making any decisions anymore. So, that was a wonderful, wonderful thing for me personally. I think the team did a fabulous job navigating it, but it must have been so stressful.

And then, as the pandemic was ending, I had a couple of things I knew I wanted to do when I was leaving and was very public about. One was work on this book, which took me a little longer than I thought, but here we are. And the second was to do this pilgrimage walk. I had read a book before I actually had decided to leave J.P. Morgan about the Via Francigena, which is a pilgrimage trail from Canterbury, England, to Rome. It’s a 1,000 miles. And I just remember feeling this overwhelming “I have to do this” when I read the book. And it’s the first and maybe only time in my life—I’m not particularly at all religious—but this just was such a compulsion. I have never felt that strong a compulsion to go do something. And I had planned on doing that shortly after I left, and as you know, the world did not permit me to do that because of Covid. But it turned into a real touchstone for me that I was going to do this walk and between the book and the walk, I felt like I knew what I was doing. And then the world, like I said, was just completely shut down, so I didn’t really notice that, it was like what was there to miss? Nothing. So, that also frankly helped, I think.

Benz: I wanted to ask about your career and the fact that you managed to be a very successful woman in a field that is largely male dominated. So, what are your key tips for women who are building their careers, I would say, inside or outside the financial-services industry?

Lester: I guess I’d say a couple of things, and I don’t know if it’s because I grew up with brothers or what. And I have to say I think J.P. Morgan has consistently done an extraordinary job of having very senior women. And even when I got to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, there were already very senior women there in the ‘90s. I was often the only woman in the room but very quickly that actually stopped being true. And I can remember even in the early 2000s being on all-female deal teams and walking into finals pitches and having a bunch of guys coming out and then a bunch of women going in and we were just like, “Yeah, bet we’re going to win this one.” And we did, because often HR benefits people are women, so it was quite noticeable actually.

I don’t think I ever experienced personally that in-your-face discrimination. I think I certainly did notice in meetings what you hear a lot about, and I think happens all the time, which is that you say something and then a guy says that three or four minutes later and then everybody goes, “Oh, what a great point you made, sir.” And I was like, “What, I just said that.” And I certainly have actually made deals in meetings with other women to make sure we call each other out and make sure, “Yeah, it was a great point. Anne just made it 10 minutes ago,” or whoever just made that 10 minutes ago. And that helps. I think that’s a great thing to do—find some allies and make sure that you don’t get talked over. I think the younger generation, again, is so much better at that stuff than we are.

I think another thing that I would always say to women, and I would say it to men too, but I think women especially struggle with that if they’re thinking about having children is to know what your priorities are in terms of career progression, the importance of being compensated, keeping your skills fresh. I don’t know that anybody talks about work-life balance anymore, but if you got offered the chance to do a big deal or you had a big commitment with your child, which one would you pick? There’s no right answer here. Everybody has got their own priorities for all kinds of reasons. But if you don’t know what they are, when you get confronted with a choice— and I remember this happening to me in, I guess it was 2000 when I came back from maternity leave after my second child was born—I got put on this Internet Lab Morgan project, which was a huge big deal and we were in a fun room with beanbag chairs and free food and we were going to break everything and reinvent financial services with this crazy internet stuff. This was almost 25 years ago now. So, I just found myself staying later and later at work because there was all this cool stuff, and we were all innovating, and it was really intellectually exciting. And then I just remember thinking, “Wait, I’m getting home at 7:30 pm, like, what the heck, I’ve got a 9-month-old at home. No, no, no, no, no!” And I pulled way back and accomplished a little less in that role than I might have, and it may have affected my career and I’m fine with that, because I had a priority and that was making sure I was home in time to have dinner with my baby or certainly feed him and have bath time with him and read him a story before he went to bed. I was sliding in 10-minutes-before-bedtime kind of a thing, and I just was like this is not the person I want to be. And it made that choice. I didn’t mind making the choice because I knew I was out of alignment with my values.

Benz: Well, Anne, this has been such a fun and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you so much for taking time to share your insights today. We really appreciate it.

Morningstar's first-ever Robo-Advisor landscape report identifies six providers as the best options for investors. Vanguard is the only one to receive a High overall assessment, while Betterment, Fidelity, Schwab, SigFig, and Wealthfront each come in at Above Average.

All six combine low costs with sound approaches to constructing portfolios and matching investors with them, responsible corporate parents, and a broad range of planning-related features. Here, we take a close look at these top robo-advisors, highlighting strengths as well as some weaknesses. You can also explore our assessments of all the leading providers in our guide to robo-investing.

Vanguard Digital Advisor/Vanguard Personal Advisor Services |High (4.5/5)

Vanguard Digital Advisor, or VDA, and its hybrid sibling Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, or PAS, which combines automation with human expertise, are not the best in every respect of the robo-advisors we surveyed, but they are the best overall.

Vanguard has been in the advice business since 1996, but it did not move into discretionary asset management until the respective May 2015 and May 2020 launches of PAS and VDA. Aiming to transform advice in the same way it revolutionized investment management with index funds, Vanguard continues to invest heavily in both services through adding capabilities and hiring personnel. In 2022, Vanguard plans to add environmental, social, and governance options to VDA and tax-loss harvesting to PAS. The two services at present otherwise have numerous features associated with top robo-advisors. VDA, for example, offers outside account aggregation, custom goal planning, debt planning, a rainy-day tool, and a next-dollar optimizer that helps investors choose between competing financial priorities.

VDA’s $3,000 minimum makes the service less accessible than some. But its 0.20% annual asset-based charge, including advisory and underlying ETF fees, is very competitive and is not reliant on waivers that might expire.

VDA’s approach to portfolio construction combines simplicity with customization. Using four broadly diversified exchange-traded funds focusing on U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and U.S. and non-U.S. bonds, VDA draws on the Vanguard Life-Cycle Model to create more than 300 glide paths based on an investor’s age, goal(s), and risk tolerance. The risk-tolerance assessment was not created in-house, however, but uses third-party Capital Preferences’ well-researched scenarios. VDA then evaluates portfolios daily and rebalances when any asset class is off target by more than 5 percentage points. The glide paths are updated annually as model inputs change.

The premium PAS offer has a $50,000 investment minimum and starts at a 0.30% annual advisory fee. Clients receive unlimited access to a pool of CFPs until their assets exceed $500,000, at which point Vanguard assigns them a dedicated CFP who touches base at least twice a year. PAS typically uses the same four total market ETFs to build portfolios; however, clients can also invest in Vanguard’s three new Advice Select active strategies, which are run by proven managers from two of Vanguard's most trusted subadvisors, as well as many other options not available within VDA.

As investors’ financial lives become more complicated, the ability to transition to PAS is a strength. In addition, PAS offers access to holistic, tailored financial planning advice at a cheaper price than any competing offering.

Betterment/Betterment Premium | Above Average (4.0/5)

Betterment’s transparency and value set it apart. Since its May 2010 launch, it has cut fees and added investment options and features to make investing and retirement planning easier for a retail audience. In October 2014, it also introduced a digital platform for financial advisors who want to manage client assets using Betterment’s tools and advice. These gradual improvements help explain its position as the largest and most successful stand-alone robo-advisor launched in the previous decade.

Betterment publicly documents on its blog how it builds and maintains various target risk portfolios while also attempting to maximize their tax efficiency. It is one of the few robo-providers that employs a glide path, which gradually adjusts the portfolio’s asset mix to become more conservative over time. Portfolio construction is sensible and well-thought-out: The main Core Portfolios series offers a mix of low-cost ETFs with exposure to several major asset classes, such as U.S. stocks, international stocks in both developed and emerging markets, investment-grade bonds, world bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. Within the U.S. equity allocation, Betterment tilts the portfolio toward value and smaller-cap stocks as part of an optimization process meant to generate higher expected returns. Beyond its core offering, Betterment offers smart-beta portfolios, target income portfolios, and sustainability-focused portfolios with specific investing styles. It also offers thematic versions of its sustainability-focused and, more recently, core portfolios through adding exposure to thematic ETFs.

Betterment bases its allocation guidance on a relatively simple risk-tolerance questionnaire. Unlike some firms, which attempt to quantify a client’s risk tolerance as a portfolio construction input, Betterment focuses on the amount and timing of the money a client needs when advising on allocation.

Betterment has a wide range of services, especially given its below-average price tag. It charges a 0.25% asset-based annual fee for automated portfolio management. Advice is part of the offer, too, and investors who aggregate their outside banking and investment accounts can get holistic help with retirement investing, goal planning, and prioritizing various accounts. Although on-demand access to an investment advisor is locked behind a steeper 0.40% fee for Betterment Premium, Betterment is one of the few robo-advisors that lets clients pay hourly for advice on specific situations, such as retirement planning, general financial advice, college savings, marriage planning, and other topics.

Morningstar Robo-Advisor Assessment Snapshot

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios/Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium | Above Average (3.6/5)

Problematic cash allocations hold back Schwab's otherwise excellent robo-advisor program. The portfolio construction process has several strengths. It uses an extensive risk-tolerance questionnaire to match investors with portfolios from one of 12 different risk levels. The portfolios provide comprehensive asset-class exposure, including both U.S. and international large- and small-cap stocks, REITs, corporates, mortgages, high yield, muni bonds, world bonds, emerging-markets debt, Treasuries, TIPS, and gold. The underlying investments are solid, while Schwab’s approach to portfolio construction, rebalancing, and tax management is thoughtful.

Although Schwab Intelligent Portfolios does not charge an advisory fee, the underlying funds’ average expense ratio is slightly above average at 0.20%. In addition, the portfolios all include allocations to low-yielding in-house cash allocations that weigh down returns and diminish purchasing power amid resurgent inflation and low bond yields. Cash allocations range from 6% of assets for the most aggressive portfolios to 29.4% for the most conservative.

The transparency of those cash accounts in relation to Schwab’s fee model is a key issue, though. While the portfolios are nominally “free” for investors with at least $5,000, those enticed by getting digital investment management without paying for it may not realize that Schwab is using the cash portion of their assets to generate revenue. Schwab receives the spread (or difference) between the revenue it earns on asset balances in Schwab Bank and the yield it pays investors. The SEC is investigating Schwab’s previous disclosures related to its use of cash, and the company set aside $200 million in 2021’s second quarter to cover potential settlement costs.

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium suffers from the same cash issue but otherwise has considerable merit. Investors with at least $25,000 have unlimited access to a financial planner holding the CFP designation. The service offers a range of online tools for advice on income, expenses, investments, college savings, retirement planning, and other issues. It is also one of the only robo-advisors to provide comprehensive retirement income advice.[1] The program helps investors determine how much they can afford to withdraw from their portfolios and schedule recurring withdrawals from both taxable and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.

The premium service’s flat fee structure allows customers to benefit from economies of scale as their asset balances grow. Following a $300 planning fee for year one, investors pay just $360 annually thereafter. That’s pricey for smaller accounts, but individuals with balances of $90,000 or more would pay less than they would for similar offerings from Betterment and Fidelity.

SigFig | Above Average (3.6/5)

SigFig is a lean offering that doesn’t sport the same scale of resources as some of its competitors, but it checks all the right boxes for a robo-advisor.

SigFig’s evolution since its 2006 start as Wikinvest, an online forum for sharing investment ideas, has helped it develop capabilities that still put it ahead of most peers. After pivoting toward automated investment advice in 2011, the firm curated a group of financial advisors to provide in-person consultations. It also introduced tax-advantaged and taxable portfolios as well as tax-loss harvesting.

SigFig’s overall fee is below the median of robo-advisors we surveyed. The program is free for accounts less than $10,000 and charges 0.25% for accounts at and above that size. It uses a suite of low-cost ETFs for its portfolios (the ETFs differ depending on which custodian the customer chooses for the account) but does not waive or return fees on these holdings.

SigFig’s portfolio construction approach is simple but sensible. Allocations are strategic and updated periodically depending on the market environment and SigFig’s capital markets assumptions. They are generally reasonable, with equity allocations for taxable portfolios ranging from 26% to 90% of assets, depending on the risk level, and 13% to 85% for retirement portfolios. Regardless of risk tolerance, however, all the tax-deferred portfolios allocate at least 7% of assets to emerging-markets debt (which could be considered slightly aggressive) as well as 5% to REITs. In addition, the portfolios rely on one broad index for U.S. stock exposure, with no granularity for separate allocations by style or market cap.

The firm’s executive team appears well-resourced, although a few senior leaders have left in recent years. The CEO and chief technology officer have both been with the firm since 2011. Chief investment officer Terry Banet, who also joined the firm in 2011, has extensive experience in investment research and asset-allocation roles at J.P. Morgan and other firms. The firm’s size peaked in 2019, however, and appears to have shrunk significantly since.

The service has some weaknesses. It does not provide advice for multiple investment goals and lacks more dedicated educational resources that could help clients make SigFig their “one-stop shop.” In addition, the privately held firm’s focus on partnering with larger corporations like UBS and Wells Fargo raises questions about whether it will remain a stand-alone robo-advisor. Many stand-alone robo-advisor firms have been acquired (witness Wealthfront’s recent agreement to join forces with UBS), and SigFig’s small size and limited revenue base could make it a more likely acquisition target than some of its peers.

Fidelity Go/Fidelity Personalized Planning & Advice | Above Average (3.5/5)

Fidelity Go stands out for its simple, straightforward approach that draws on Fidelity’s strong global research and asset-allocation team. Many key executives within the Fidelity Strategic Advisors unit overseeing this program have spent at least 15 to 20 years with the firm. Fidelity Go is free for accounts with balances up to $10,000 and charges $3 per month for accounts between $10,000 and $50,000. Investors with balances above $50,000 pay 0.35% per year.

The program starts with a relatively thorough risk-tolerance questionnaire. Questions cover the investor’s investment goals, time horizon, household income, risk tolerance, investment experience, investment knowledge, reaction to falling markets, emergency fund, spending as a percentage of income, likelihood of unexpected future expenses, household financial situation including job security, and value of total assets. Fidelity then uses this information to map investors to a taxable or retirement-focused portfolio, with each spanning seven different risk levels. The portfolios all focus on a short list of core asset classes, such as U.S. stocks, international stocks, and intermediate core bonds; esoteric asset classes or ESG-focused strategies aren’t part of the offer.

Although Fidelity Go’s investment advisory fees are slightly above the peer median for higher account balances, it invests in a streamlined list of zero-expense ratio Fidelity Flex funds, which keeps total costs slightly below average.

The program also offers ongoing support. Text alerts and other communications let customers know how they are progressing with their goals, as well as provide behavioral nudges to encourage long-term investing. Like VDA, however, Fidelity Go does not currently offer tax-loss harvesting.

Fidelity’s premium Personalized Planning & Advice service (available for accounts with at least $25,000) charges 0.50% of assets and offers additional financial planning services. Participants have access to unlimited advice and planning calls and can choose from a menu of coaching solutions focused on different topics, including retirement planning, budgeting, and debt management. In contrast to Betterment and Schwab, though, not all its financial advisors hold the CFP designation, which makes its 0.50% price tag comparatively steep.

Wealthfront | Above Average (3.5/5)

Wealthfront has considerable merits, although some strategic shifts and questionable allocations hold it back.

The merits start with attractive fees. Its 0.25% annual advisory charge is cheaper than most, and expense ratios are reasonable for most of the underlying funds used in the portfolios. The quality of the underlying funds is also generally strong; the majority used in Wealthfront’s portfolios receive Morningstar Analyst Ratings of Gold or Silver. The program includes a thorough questionnaire that incorporates behavioral economics research to evaluate both risk tolerance (an investor’s subjective willingness to take risk) and risk capacity (their objective ability to take risk given their financial assets and other resources).

Wealthfront uses the responses to slot investors into a portfolio matching one of 20 risk levels spanning three account types: taxable, retirement, and socially responsible investing. Customers also have access to financial planning tools (though not to human financial advisors) for spending, savings, income growth, inflation, Social Security, taxes, college planning, and home equity. The website provides information on a wide range of planning-related questions, as well as numerous methodology papers and transparent performance disclosures.

Still, some of Wealthfront’s strategic pivots seem driven by popular but not necessarily prudent investment trends. Many of its portfolios are on the aggressive side; for example, its retirement portfolios allocate up to 14% to emerging-markets stocks, 15% to real estate, and 10% to emerging-markets debt. It previously opted investors into a risk parity strategy that has consistently disappointed; Wealthfront now lets them invest up to 10% of their assets in cryptocurrency through Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) GBTC and/or Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) ETHE, which are high-cost vehicles whose grantor trust structure leads to significant tracking error.

Its early 2022 agreement to be acquired by UBS is ironic given that this Swiss banking giant is the kind of firm Wealthfront originally sought to disrupt. However, Wealthfront says UBS has committed to letting Wealthfront continue to operate under its own brand as a stand-alone business.

[1] Capital One Investing also offers advice on retirement drawdown strategies but is much smaller. Morningstar was previously a minority owner of Capital One Investing predecessor United Income, which Capital One acquired in 2019.

Transcript Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is personal finance expert and author Ramit Sethi. Ramit's first book "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" published in 2009 was a best-seller. The new edition of the book came out last year. Ramit is the founder of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com and Earnable, an online course created to help entrepreneurs start and accelerate their businesses. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford.

Ramit, welcome to The Long View.

Ramit Sethi: Thanks for having me.

Benz: We're really excited to have you here. Your book is called "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich."" You also are in charge of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com. In the book rich doesn't simply mean amassing a lot of assets. How do you define it?

Sethi: Well, one of the key insights of my work over the last 16 years has been that rich is quite different for each of us. And interestingly, rich might be your ability to go out and buy $1,000 cashmere sweater. Great. No problem with that at all. Go for it. For others, it might be being able to pick up your son or daughter from school at 3 pm. That's also a rich life. But one of the things that I like to do when I start off talking about money with people, I don't talk about compound interest, I don't talk about asset allocation. I start off by asking people what their rich life is. And it is absolutely fascinating how people respond to that question.

Ptak: One concept you discuss is called the money dial. What does that mean? And what are some examples?

Sethi: Well, this was the exercise that I created when I wanted to help people understand what they actually want to do with their money. Interestingly, when you ask people, what is your rich life, they almost always give you the same three answers. The first one is freedom. I want to do what I want, when I want. Then sometimes they will say, I want to be able to pay off my debt. That's sort of a dim dream, I think. If your only goal is to get to zero, that's not very motivational for people. And then, finally, you have people who talk about their third point with money and what their rich life is, is very vague when you ask that question.

So, when I push them on what their rich life is, what do you want, suddenly, things change. And the way that I did this was I asked them, what do you love spending money on, love, not like love? And everybody's eyes light up. They start smiling. Everybody's got one thing. The most common answers here are eating out. That's number one. Second is health and wellness. And the third travel, okay. After that there's a steep decline. But there are a variety of different categories. Mine happens to be convenience.

And then, I asked them a question like this, I say, what if you could quadruple your spending? What would it look like and what would it feel like? And this is really a pivotal moment for people. Because most people have never thought about spending more on the things they love. They've actually only been berated to spend less on everything. When you ask them what it would look and feel like to spend more on eating out, they typically have the same response. Well, I'd probably have to go on a diet because I eat out four times a week. But I push them gently. And I remember speaking to a young man in DC while I was on a book tour. And he said the same thing about going on a diet. And I said, really? What would you do if you could quadruple the amount you spend? And he started looking off into space. And he finally said, I have a list of every Michelin starred restaurant in town, I would go there. And I leaned in, I said, who would you take with you? And he said, my family because they've never been able to afford to go to those places. That is a money dial. That is what turning up that dial can look like. And once you know what you want to spend money extravagantly on, then you can cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't care about.

Benz: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. How do the boring old financial jobs fit into this framework like, you know, saving for retirement or building an emergency fund? Retirement security is probably never going to be anyone's money dial, but it has to be done, right? So, how do you fit the two things together, the sort of more aspirational vision for your life alongside the things that you know you have to do?

Sethi: Well, I've worked with millions of people through my website, through my newsletters, social media, books and tours. My conclusion also based on my work in psychology and behavioral change, is that we want to start and meet people where they are. And I find that the minute anyone starts talking about money, whether it's in a financial advisor's office or reading a 401(k) brochure, they're already on defense, because most people don't know about personal finance, but they know enough to know that they're doing something wrong. And that's not a good sign to help them absorb and learn and make moves.

So, if it were up to me and I were advising financial advisors on their primary first conversation, there would be no math allowed, there would be no compound interest, there would be no words like estate allowed. Not at all. The questions are human questions that you might ask your children or your friends or parents. What's important to you, what do you want to do with your life? What does your rich life look like? What if you could spend more on that? These are questions that any person can answer, and they actually want to answer it. People desperately want to talk about their dreams. But until we get that down and set some foundational context for what their vision is of their future, then no amount of interest rates and returns and expense ratios are going to matter.

And I can tell you that many of us have experienced with people who end up in their 60s, let's say, they have some money, but they have no idea what to do. No idea what to do with it. They saved and they did all the right things, but they forgot the most important thing, which is to have a reason why. I remember I was having dinner with somebody in their 60s. And I asked him, if you could go back and give yourself advice in your 20s, what would you tell yourself? Any thought about it for a second? And he said, save more. I would have saved more. And I happen to know his financial situation. He's done fine. He has money. I said, if you'd save more, what would you have done with the extra money? You've got money now. What would you have done with some extra? And he looked at me stumped. It is reflexive. It's almost religious in our culture to save money. Now, that doesn't mean we do it. There's just words around and there's all these commercials out there telling people save and invest in 401(k) and this and that. Doesn't mean we do it. But what we lack is asking people why, what do they want to do and pushing them on it, not accepting the first typically lazy answer, I want to do what I want, when I want. Well, what is that? When you get into that, then suddenly people are much more receptive to these foundational concerns of retirement and tax-advantaged investing, et cetera.

Ptak: I had a couple practical follow-ups. One is defining a rich life that can vary from member to member of a household. And so, the question is how to reconcile between those definitions? And then, also, I would imagine that the definition of rich life is not static. It does change over time. And so, how should one navigate that as well?

Sethi: There absolutely are seasons in life that change. I want to start with that question because I love that one. And one of the things that I observe is the financial-services industry focusing primarily on getting people ready for the rich life in people's 60s and beyond. That's the reason I started I Will Teach You to Be Rich. Nobody was speaking to people of my age at the time I was in college and nobody was talking about the things we wanted to do. We wanted to go out. I wanted to be able to buy around and drinks for my friends. That was a rich life to me. Certainly, it was not thinking about estate planning at age 20. And also, getting advice from people who look and sound like you is profoundly important, that representation really matters.

Of course, over time, those change. We know that there are pivotal moments when people have a family, when they get a new job, potentially if they get divorced, of course, retirement. Those change over time. What is interesting is encouraging people, I think, to seize those seasons and really push it to the limit in whatever season you're in. For example, if you are in--let's just use your 20s for example. Of course, you should save for retirement. And of course, compounding matters more than ever in your 20s. You have a massive opportunity. But there's also opportunities to do things that you cannot do in your 40s, things like take a very long, extended trip. And so, that is part of a financial plan, too. It might not show up in a spreadsheet, but it's part of a rich life. And I find that people are much more receptive when you talk to them and acknowledge the season of life that they are in. You're in your 20s, you want to take a month-and-a-half to go to Europe? Awesome. Let's talk about how to make that happen. Yeah, okay, there'll be some trade-offs. But if you look at this and you decide looking back 20 years from now, would you regret not going? Sounds like it's the right call for you. Okay?

Of course, now, as for the spouse question, or partner question, oh, that's a tricky one. And I really, really love this. I have some first-hand experience being married. And we started off with different money lenses. And that was extremely challenging. And over time, I've been very thankful and grateful that I've been able to go through it on a personal level as well. One thing that I recommend in Chapter 9 of my book, when two people sit down to talk about money, usually it devolves into how could you spend so much on coffee and these sort of $3 questions, when in reality, most people should be asking $30,000 questions.

My advice is, if you are sitting down for the first time to really have a series of money conversations, again, we're not talking math in the first, second, maybe even third meeting, we're talking about how were you raised around money, what'd your parents say at the dinner table? What's your first memory? What's something you've changed your mind about with money since you were a kid? Just really getting into it. And of course, being vulnerable yourself. The other more tactical advice that I give is, when you set your first savings goal together, make it fun. What's a trip we want to go on together? What's an experience we want to create? Let's save for that. Because money then becomes a source of pleasure, not simply a source of beratement or feeling bad about yourself.

Benz: You reference that people spend too much time on the $3 questions and they should be thinking about the $30,000 questions. So, what are those $30,000 questions?

Sethi: Negotiating your salary, making sure you're working at the right job. That's a skill. It's not purely luck. You can learn how to navigate the career space. And you can learn how to negotiate salaries. We routinely teach people how to negotiate $10,000 or $20,000, salary increases. Asset allocation, that's a big win. That matters far more than any amount of lattes you could ever buy. Your fees, the fees that you were paying. Of course, we know the importance of fees as investors and yet, think about how much time we spend, whether it'd be cutting coupons or rate-chasing as opposed to really evaluating once a year, are we paying the proper fees for the advice we're getting, not just financially, but in all different parts of our life.

Your relationship, that's a big win. That's a big financial win as well, making sure that you have the right relationship, and that you are aligned on your spending. And also, another big win, your earning. So, this is something that I think is typical more of my millennial readers, people in their 20s and 30s. They are increasingly looking at additional ways to make income beyond their job. Many of them have jobs, but many of them are using, whether it's our programs, or they're doing it on their own, to start a business, started on the side, eventually, maybe even go full time. And we have many multiple six-figure earners, we also have folks who are making an extra $5,000 a month, or even $500, and that's quite meaningful. So, there are approximately 5 to 10 big wins in life and a big win, if you get that right, you never have to worry about appetizers or lattes again.

Ptak: How do you apply this ethos to people that are dealing with issues of income security and also uncertainty around healthcare security? I know that they would have their own definition of rich life, but I would tend to think that it's going to be a very, very pragmatic definition. And so, can you take what you've been describing and apply it to those types of situations as well?

Sethi: Yeah, and I'm so glad you asked about that, because I do believe in personal responsibility and I do believe in educating ourselves and making what we can with the situation that we are given. But I also believe that there needs to be systemic reform, and there are some serious structural issues that go on. So, it's one thing to say, Hey, you know, make a debt payoff plan and try to earn more. That's great, and you should do that. But if you are one step away from going bankrupt because of healthcare laws, that's not acceptable, especially in the United States of America. Now, as for practical and more tactical advice, I find that 95% of the people I talk to who are in debt do not know how much debt they actually hold. Why would they? It's a painful number to reckon with. So, it's easier to simply not open up that envelope.

The second thing is that 99% of them do not have a debt payoff plan. They don't even know how much they owe; how could they know when it's going to be paid off? The simplest and really most effective thing that you can do if you're in debt is to get all your payments together. If you don't even know how much you owe and who you owe it to, call them up and make those companies do the work for you. How much do I owe? What's my balance? What's my interest rate? And what is my current debt payoff date, if I go, as I've currently been going. Then you can work with these companies, whether it's a credit card company, student loan company, car loan. And there are many people--I remember speaking to somebody who is in $350,000 of student loan debt. That's crushing. That's crushing. And thanks to some recent laws, that's also nondischargeable. He found that with tweaking his payments a little bit paying an extra 50 to $100, which he could manage, he could shave off years of that debt payoff plan.

So, there certainly are things you can do. There are no silver bullets. There is no magic script that you can use. You can negotiate down APRs on your credit card. A lot of people don't know that. And some of these debtors actually do want to help you out. But the larger key is making a plan and then automating the execution of that so that it is not dependent on any motivation or inspiration every day. That is the way that you can slowly, methodically and healthily pay off that debt.

Benz: You've called traditional budgeting pointless. Why is that? And what's a better way to get in touch with how you're spending?

Sethi: Well, most people don't do it. And they don't want to do it. So, it's pointless and ineffective. Because if we simply look at the efficacy, it just doesn't work. Who wants to look at how much they spent last month, knowing that they probably overspent and then having to reckon with that? It's like people don't like to get a cavity taken out. It's like, do you want to do that every month? And then also correlate that with how poorly you ate and why you're causing yourself to get cavities? No, we don't want to do that. So, we don't, and guess what, life goes on. That's how most Americans live. They don't have a budget, and life goes on. It's fine until one day, it's not. And I wanted to change that for a long time.

When I started writing my blog in 2004 and eventually went on to write a book, I purchased many of the other personal finance books out there. And what I discovered was in Chapter 1, many I would say most of the other money books start off by saying, let's find out how much you spent last month. And that's a great way for people to politely close the book and say, No, thank you, I'm going to put that right back on the bookshelf. Nobody wants to do it. So, instead, I wanted to create a more forward-looking plan.

Yeah, let's look at the past. Let's analyze what we spent for the last roughly four weeks. It's not going to be perfect, but it's 85% of the way there. More importantly, let's plan out where we want our money to go. So, blank slate. If you could have your money go anywhere, where would it go? Now, it's really fascinating. If you ask the average person who's not educated in personal finances at all, they actually have no idea about some of these basic rules. They don't know 28-36. They don't know 10% for savings or investments. They don't know these numbers. And that's okay. So, they start off with this idea that's not particularly sophisticated. But what I did was with the help of my community and the millions of people who've been reading, I figured out how much people typically are spending on fixed expenses, et cetera. And when you give people a benchmark and you explain why, suddenly they realize, okay, I can make that work. And sometimes when they can't, I can't really afford to put 10% in savings. Okay, what am I going to do? Well, you know what, I can do 7% this year, and then I'm going to focus on increasing my salary and my car payment is going to end. So, I'll be able to do that next year. Okay, great.

People are very, very comfortable once they have a benchmark of saying, look, I may not be able to hit it perfectly, but I'm generally on track and that makes me feel good. That is so profoundly different from look at a spreadsheet full of things you spent on last month and then figure out what to do about it. That's like it's empty. You're throwing people into a national park and saying, make your way out of here. It's impossible, it's very difficult. So, instead, what I want to do a conscious spending plan, look forward, decide where you want your money to go. Here are some benchmarks that are very helpful. And if you can hit these, you are good. You don't have to worry about anything else. Just hit these basic numbers of savings and investment and the rest is guilt-free spending. You could spend it on whatever you want.

Ptak: So, how do you think that the pandemic has affected the way some of those you work with have set their conscious spending plans? I would have to think that they would be revisiting some aspects of those plans, just given the way circumstances have intervened. And so, can you talk a little bit about maybe what sort of changes you've been making in consultation with clients and whether you've revisited any aspects of your framework in light of what we've experienced?

Sethi: Yes, it's a great question. I have. As soon as the pandemic happened, I decided to make some very rapid changes. And first, my wife and I left the city. We left it pretty early on, and even so early that our friends were like, what are you doing, and maybe it's I've watched too many Batman movies and I've seen bad things happening in cities. I said, we should get out of here. So that was first thing was taking care of my family. Second thing was taking care of my team. So, we initiated a COVID stipend for anyone who needed additional funding for whatever reason, groceries, for their parents, or their family or themselves. And then, we also initiated a debt freeze, or a payment freeze, I should say, for any of our customers. So, we have tens of thousands of customers. Anyone who needed to put their payments on hold, we initiated that proactively, no problem. And then, we raised a bunch of money for Feeding America and other organizations.

Finally, when I spoke to my readers, looking at the economy, as it got worse and worse, I did make one change. I recommended that they increase their emergency fund savings from six months to 12 months. Now, that is quite aggressive. And the reflexive response for some was, that's crazy, you're telling me that I should stop investing, so I can put money in a savings account that's basically losing money. I find that interestingly a lot of people who really should be the beneficiaries of being financially conservative take unnecessary risks. In truth, the extra return you might get for a few months of savings in the grand scheme of your life, it's not really that big. But having the safety and security of a six- to 12-month emergency fund can truly be a lifesaver if your job or entire industry goes away. So, I did advise them on that.

The other thing that I recommended was a three-part framework. And that framework is first play defense. So, get your 12-month emergency fund in order. If you've got that, next, continue your investing plan as usual. We know that it's not about timing the market, it's time in the market. And then, finally, go on offense. If you have done defense, and you've continued that you still have money, which a lot of people do, although it's not really palatable to talk about it publicly, go on offense, look for opportunities, whether it's starting a business, many of my Earnable students have done that, whether it's looking for investment opportunities, whether it's simply writing a big check to a charity or a family member that needs it. Go on offense and use your money in a meaningful way. That's a three-part framework that I have adapted based on COVID. And it's really helped people understand what to do in a time like this.

Benz: You referenced the importance of having an emergency fund and enlarging it potentially at this time. Do you like the idea of automating that for people like maybe embedding that in terms of workplace retirement savings, where they have an option to save short term in some fashion as well? Seems like people really struggle with getting their emergency funds together.

Sethi: Yes, I mean, I'm a huge fan of automation, in any and all regard. So, when I was back in college, studying human behavior and psychology and technology, and just looking at what happens, for example, when firms introduced automated 401(k) contributions, right? You could spend the next 50 years educating people about tax advantages, or you can simply make 401(k) opt out. Make it automatic, boom, compliance jumps above 90%. And so, the more we can automate these things, the better. And I think this is a really important point for anyone in the financial-services industries.

Let's remember this. nobody really cares about being a financial expert. I want to say it again, because it's so important. Nobody cares about being a financial expert. They don't want to. This is really important. All they want is for their money to go to the right places and for them to be safe and okay. That's it. And so, we make a profound mistake when we give people a 300-page document and a Monte Carlo analysis. We say, here you go, there you go, that's your life. Nobody cares. You would think they would care because they claim that money is the most important, but they care in the way that they can approach it. And that is why when I talk about money, whether it's on Instagram--like yesterday when I talked about some myths about raising taxes on the rich, I used examples that resonate with them. If they want to read the math, I can talk about the math. But most people want to be approached with their money in a way that resonates with them.

So, for automation, most people do not want to manually go and transfer things. They may want the outcome of that. Of course, they want a nice savings account that's growing. But every month, they're motivated month one, month two, okay, they'll do it, month three, they got something else going on. It's, I think, a sign of humility and understanding when we acknowledge we are imperfect as human beings. And that doesn't mean we're bad. It simply means that we should use systems to make up for our flaws. If you tried to get me to manually invest every single month, I'd probably do it three, four, five, six months in a row, maybe month seven, I would forget. I know that. I acknowledge that. That's a human weakness. So, I set up automation. And the more we can do that for ordinary and frankly, sophisticated people, the better, because people are more than happy to tweak the system once or twice if they know that it's going to provide ongoing benefits. It's when you demand people pay attention for the rest of their lives to something that becomes very difficult for people to actually adhere to it.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to one of the three elements that you mentioned in your framework, which is this notion of going on offense, which I think is very intriguing, and I think actually will hold an appeal to a lot of people. But at the same time, the pandemic can be a difficult environment in which to make big life choices. And so, how have you worked with those that you work with, to help them navigate that making sure that if they are going to make a big life choice, they're doing so in the correct state of mind, knowing how much pressure, I suppose, we're all under right now, given the environment.

Sethi: In order to make these big life choices, I intentionally made that the last step in the framework. I don't want somebody who has no emergency fund, who has one month of investments, suddenly deciding that they want to pack up, move, try some crazy investment, change jobs. I don't want that. It's risk upon risk upon risk, it's too much. So, therefore, I intentionally advise people first play defense. I want that emergency fund up. Second, I want you to continue your investing plan. If you don't have an investing plan, now is the time. Go read my book or read any other book. And then, third, and only if you've done those other two things, then you have earned the right to play at this level. This is a methodical approach. But when I share why, people intuitively get it.

We all know that when we were kids, we earned the right to watch TV after we finished our homework. We've known this principle since we were children. It's only though as adults that we want everything all at once. And there's really nobody to tell us no. Because of the trust I build up with my readers over the last 16 years, I tell them what I believe, I tell them exactly what I'm doing. I tell them the accounts that I use, the banks that I love, the banks that I hate. I'm very, very transparent with them. And I even tell them that people like me, I should be taxed more. And they've never heard somebody talk like that. Wow, somebody who's actually advocating for himself to be taxed more. What? So, they know that they're here and it's straight, whatever I tell them. And thanks to my business model, I create products, they buy it, if they find value, they keep them. So, it's a very straightforward aligned business model. We don't do commissions or anything like that.

And so, when somebody like me says, look, you got to earn the right to be able to play at that level, they understand that. And so, although it might be a little unpalatable, Oh, I have to focus on savings for the next six months, that's so boring, it's earning nothing in my bank account. They understand there's a bigger picture. And they remember, we always start with what is your rich life. So, whether it's traveling five-star resorts, or whether it's going to taking six months off to go build houses in a different country or even here in America, they understand that we are working toward each of our rich lives. That's why they are willing to take it step-by-step as opposed to trying to jump to the more advanced stuff right off the bat.

Benz: So, it seems like the financial-services industry is really warming up to this idea of helping clients align their finances with their aspirations and their life goals. But I guess some of it strikes me as kind of marketing spin. So, if I'm a consumer and I'm attempting to discern, like who's good at this and who is just trying to get money so that they can manage it, how do I figure that out?

Sethi: Well, Christine, I'm absolutely shocked that you would accuse the financial-services industry of pure marketing. I am shocked that you would say that. How could you? Yes, it's true. I think, overall, it's a good thing that the financial-services industry is realigning to focus on what people want, what they actually need. I think there are some really interesting business model challenges. I've spoken to several advisors who I really like and respect. And they point out, I think, quite accurately that what's more valuable to the client is behavioral advice. However, most people are not really willing to pay for that. And so, that's certainly a challenge going forward.

I will say that, in my opinion, the financial-services industry should be advocating first and foremost for their clients to be put first. I think the reflexive arguments against the fiduciary rule are nonsensical. I mean, it's actually unbelievable some of the stuff that I saw in the press. Some firms and companies claiming that if they have to be fiduciaries and put their clients first, fewer Americans will get good financial advice, because they can't afford to give it to them. They actually put that in writing. I can't believe it. What type of industry or firm would actually say that publicly? With that said, the advisors who stand out are the ones, in my opinion, who are of course, putting their client first. But that's really just table stakes. They're connecting with them in interesting and engaging ways. They're writing content, they're also creating their own methodologies of how to reach people, and how to connect with them. In other words, they're not starting off by talking about what is your retirement goal? That's not their first question in the first meeting or the first day at all. They're talking about what's your life like, tell me about it. What would you do differently?

So, yeah, there is some element of marketing. I agree. Again, financial services is known for that. But in general, I do want ordinary Americans to have access to great information about money. And personally, I just wish things were a little easier. I've spent 20 years studying money, understanding it, doing it on my own, helping millions of people. You shouldn't have to do that to get good at money, you really shouldn't. Things should largely go well if you do a few basic things. You should automatically be contributing to your 401(k). You should automatically have a savings account. You should automatically understand, do I have enough, is getting a house actually a good decision for me, et cetera. And that, of course, involves a combination of financial services and products; it involves systemic change, government role, and of course, individual responsibility as well.

Ptak: That all sounds like sensible advice. My question would be do those who are trying to achieve some of the goals that you described need a financial advisor, and if they determine they do, should they be paying them 1% of the assets under advisement to get the help that they need?

Sethi: Well, I'm going to tell you what I tell my readers. I tell them that the majority of people do not need a financial advisor, you can do this on your own. And I show them exactly what to do. I show them funds, I show them asset allocation, I show them automation, even down to the level of this is the date on which your transfer should happen from this account to that. Once they set it up, I found over the course of millions of people using my material, they're quite good and quite confident at it. That's fantastic.

Now, there are certain reasons to hire an advisor. And I've been very explicit about what those reasons are and how to hire a good advisor. Also, I've hired an advisor myself, okay? I fit one of those rules, which was I wanted a second set of eyes, a temporary second set of eyes on my investment plan. And I think that depending on how large your portfolio is, or how complex your situation is, for example, you might be in a second marriage, you might have multiple children going to college, you might be starting to think about downshifting retirement. Those are all pivotal moments where you may say, you know what, I'd like to get a second set of eyes, just make sure I haven't missed anything big.

So, there are reasons that you may want to hire an advisor. The average American, I advise them, you can do this yourself, you can certainly get started yourself. And I have to emphasize why I say that. I don't think we should delegate one of the most important things in our life. And this is not the same as delegating your oil being changed or your lawn being mowed or even going out to a restaurant having somebody cook for you. This is profoundly deep. It cuts across everything you and potentially your spouse do.

So, when you ask people in their 40s, what are you worried about? And the primary answer is always the same, money, this tells you, it's got to be something that you yourself are tackling. You're getting in there, rolling up your sleeves and doing it, and you can. As for the people who do hire an advisor for a temporary second set of eyes, or they want a plan, that's fine. I show them how they should interview five different advisors, they should, of course, get along with them, ask them if they're a fiduciary. They should pay an hourly rate. I'm happy if people pay a high hourly rate. Premium service, premium prices, I'm all good with that. They should not pay a 1% fee. I do not support that at all. And I've been very clear about why that is. There's no reason that an ordinary investor should be paying an assets under management fee. As we know from the research, those fees do not produce better returns in investing or in behavioral response either. And so, pay an hourly rate. Even if the hourly rate is high, great, pay it. In the short term, it might seem expensive; in the long term, anything is cheaper than 1% AUM.

Benz: You've recommended robo-advisors for people who need help with their investments. Would target-date funds be a worthy solution as well, especially for people who are just kind of getting their financial footing?

Sethi: I love target-date funds. They're my favorite investment. And I highly recommend them. They're great, because they're simple. They are one investment. They're automatically diversified and automatically rebalanced. I can't recommend them enough to people. And it's funny--when you speak to beginning investors, they've been taught through media, movies that you have to pick stocks and you've got to have big multiple screens with green letters running across. They're almost skeptical when you tell them. No, it's actually just one fund. That's it. And all you need to do is set it up to automatically invest, and you're done. And when you tell them that you should actually be spending less than 60 minutes a month on your finances, they almost don't believe you. The irony is, they're drawn to the more complex, because it seems mysterious. But in actuality, once you get really good at something, you learn that really the crux of success in that field is typically very, very simple. Same with investing, right? Automatic investing consistently, low fees and focus on the long term. It's really simple, almost too simple.

Ptak: Maybe we can talk about what seems like the antithesis of that, which is brokerage accounts like Robinhood, which had become popular among young investors just starting out. The question is, is this a good way for young people to get started investing, in your opinion?

Sethi: No, nobody should be using Robinhood. It makes zero sense. It's toxic for young people in particular, who are now being trained from day one to believe that investing is about randomly picking individual stocks. And I would be willing to bet--in fact, I would be willing to bet a large amount of money that early Robinhood investors will have lower lifetime earnings and lower lifetime investment returns than the average Vanguard investor.

Benz: I want to talk about homeownership. You have argued that many people overemphasize homeownership as a component of a successful financial life. And it's definitely hard to argue that homes are always great investments, but they are the largest source of wealth for many households. And they're also I guess, as an illiquid asset, something that people can stick with, and not tap for short-term needs and so forth. So, I guess, how does homeownership fit in? How do you suggest that people approach that?

Sethi: Yeah, this has been a really interesting conversation that I've had with my readers over the years. My big advice for people when it comes to buying a house is that I want them to run the numbers. It seems so simple and innocent. Of course, Ramit, we'll run the numbers. But as I've dug deeper into it, I've discovered so many things about buying a house. In this country, real estate is religion. And we grow up being taught these phrases like you're throwing money away on rent, don't pay your landlord's mortgage, or they're not building more land. And so, people grow up without really thinking about it. But eventually ""knowing"" that they should buy a house, and this is so funny. You hear people talking about this. One of the favorite things on the Internet is to complain about how expensive weddings are. No matter what if you write about weddings, somebody's coming out, popping out of the comments section and saying, oh my god, you spent that much? Well, I spent $52 and we sort of hot tamales at our wedding and we're still married 30 years later. That's such a waste of money. And people will then say, yeah, we could have taken that money and bought a house with it. Notice that the wedding and the house are always tied together.

Now, where do you think that came from? You have people who are largely financially unsophisticated. You never hear folks talking about investing, target-date funds, dollar-cost averaging. But suddenly, when it comes to a wedding, they're talking about, oh, we would just prefer to just put that down for a down payment. Where'd that come from? And the answer is that there's been a systematic marketing campaign from The National Association of Realtors. The government and of course, our parents, who bought houses, telling us that you need to buy a house. That's the best investment there is.

When I started to dig into this, I became extremely fascinated because if you actually truly run the total cost, you include what I call the Phantom costs of buying a house and you compare it to investing in an S&P 500 fund, you will often find that housing is not a great investment. Not always, but a lot of times. I have lived in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. I've rented in all of those by choice. It would have made no financial sense for me to buy. I want to say that again because it is so counterintuitive. It still makes no financial sense for me to buy. And I could buy right now. So, I'm a renter by choice. I'm sure one day I will buy. I'm also sure that when I do, I'm sure the house is going to be great. I'm also sure it's probably going to be a terrible financial decision.

What happens is you have somebody saying, you know, my grandma bought a house in Texas in 1970 for $200,000 and she just sold it for $600,000. She made $400,000 of pure profit. But of course, if we dig into the numbers and we look at how much she spent on maintenance and taxes and interest and then we compare all that plus your down payment to what you could have made by just simply investing in a S&P 500 fund for 0.1%, you often find that people could have made much more by renting, key being they need to invest the difference. That's a big, big key.

My point with this is not to tell people that buying a house is a bad decision. That's not my point. Like I said, I will buy a house someday. My point is that a rich life involves deep thinking about your big decisions and buying a house is perhaps the biggest financial decision for most people. I don't want people going into it unknowingly. I don't want them getting charged crazy fees on their investments. I don't want them investing in things that are not properly diversified and I don't want them buying something that for a lot of people ends up making them house poor and because of the way that all the fees are levied and obscured, they don't actually realize, wow, this house is costing me a lot more than I thought.

So, I'm giving people permission, run the numbers, question what you've been told about buying a house. It may be right for you, or it may not. But you should never feel pushed into a large financial decision. You should get clear on the difference between what is a luxury purchase and what is an investment. And you should get educated about all of your different options because you have lots of options to grow your money. And if you want to use housing, that's fine. Understand the trade-offs. If you want to do a target-date fund, great. If you want to do all the above, great. But I don't want somebody using phrases that they were taught when they were seven years old--don't throw money away on rent. That's not what I want. I want my I Will Teach You to Be Rich readers and everybody listening, take the unconventional choice, run the numbers, decide what is right for you and your rich life. I have found that to be very, very rewarding.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to an earlier question on Robinhood specifically, but maybe we will widen it out to the concept of learning by doing and specifically, learning by making mistakes. And I guess, it's sort of tied in with the you only live once sort of ethos, right, YOLO. And I know that one of the defenses that some have mounted for things like Robinhood is that you kind of get it out of your system and you learn from some of those mistakes. And so, maybe to broaden out in your experience, is that important or really should we focus more on precisely defining what is truly important to us in leading a rich life and try to minimize mistakes like those?

Sethi: Everyone's going to make mistakes. I made them myself. When I started off investing as a teenager, my dad helped me open up a custodial IRA and I thought that investing meant picking stocks. So, I picked three random stocks. Two of them went bankrupt. And I quickly learned I didn't know what I was talking about and I spent the next few years really learning about money and testing my approaches on myself and then slowly with my readers. I never hold it against anyone if they make mistakes, particularly when they're starting off. Hey, you know you're going to get an overdraft fee. Okay, great. Use the script in Chapter 1, get that reversed. Hey, you might pick the wrong account. No big deal. Let's fix it while it's small because soon your numbers are going to get quite large and those mistakes can be costly.

If people were to join a service like Robinhood with the mindset of, you know what, I'm going to experiment with this for three months. I'm going to allocate $1,000 and that's what I'm using to invest. And then, at the end, that's it. That's my cap. Great. That's not what's happening. If you look at people in forums and subreddits discussing this, that is not what's happening at all. We have people leveraging. We have people borrowing. We have people who are surrounding themselves in an echo chamber of others who are encouraging day-trading. And long-term sophisticated investors know that net-net these folks are going to lose money. What's even worse, they're going to create bad financial habits that I argue will last the rest of their lives.

So, it's no problem to make mistakes. We're all going to make mistakes at any age, at any level of sophistication, but there are certain things that are so dangerous that we should be extremely careful about trying without clear rules and guidelines for ourselves and this is one of them.

Benz: We've had a couple of guests from the FIRE movement on the podcast, and sometimes I see your perspective being cast as sort of the opposite of FIRE. Is that your view? Are you anti-FIRE?

Sethi: No, I'm not anti-FIRE. I know a lot of the FIRE folks and I think the FIRE community is especially interesting. First off, anything that gets Americans to increase their savings rate in general I think is a good thing, okay? Personally, I do not encourage extreme frugality. And one of the principles that I share with I Will Teach You to Be Rich is live life outside the spreadsheet. Meaning, at a certain point you've won the game. You already know your early retirement date, or you've already accumulated enough to retire at whatever age you want. Fine, great. Congratulations. At that stage, get out of the spreadsheet. Running another analysis and tweaking your portfolio by 0.01% is not going to change anything.

With the FIRE community, one thing that I've encouraged when I did another podcast with Mad Fientist was what are you going to use the money for. And if your answer is, I want to do what I want when I want, that's not an answer for someone that has spent years optimizing for the next step of life. My encouragement with I Will Teach You to Be Rich and my approach is, let's start living that life now. There are things that many of us have experienced, friends or parents, who get to a certain age, they have big plans and then something happens. They get struck by an illness. Something unexpected happens and they simply can't do it. That's the last thing I want for my readers. There are also certain things that you can't simply start older in life. It's more difficult. Folks often on some of these subreddits are talking about, you know, when I retire, I want to learn a different language and I want to travel and this and that. Awesome. I love it. But all we need to do is look at the last two years of anyone's life to have a fairly good predictor of what they're going to do in the next two years of life. If you've been traveling now, you're probably going to travel more later. If you haven't, I would say it's unlikely that you're going to dramatically change your life in retirement.

I heard a very fascinating principle related to early retirement, et cetera, which was a relative of mine said, we really have 20 years of peak spending--not talking about saving, talking about spending--40 to 60. Now, we can disagree on what those numbers might be. But he said, look, early on, you don't have any money, fine. But at a certain point, whether it be health reasons or interest reasons or family reasons, you're not going to go on a backpacking trip around Europe when you're 78. So, you have these peak 20 years to spend. Now, let's make sure, of course, we don't run out of money, of course. Let's also be as intentional about spending. What are the seasons of life that I'm in right now? What's important to me? Is it children? Is it my spouse? Is it my family? Is it charity? Is it a venture? Let's really dial in on those. Knowing we have a finite amount of time and we should spend as much time on that as we do tweaking our investments and tracking our spending and running a Monte Carlo analysis.

So, I have no problem with the FIRE community. I love anybody that encourages us to think deeply about what our rich life is and increase our savings rates. I do think that money alone is not a rich life. You can have $1 million; you can have $10 million. That's just a number in a spreadsheet. What you do with it, that is when you truly craft and create your rich life.

Ivanna Hampton: Welcome to Investing Insights. I’m your host, Ivanna Hampton.

Investment accounts like 401(k)s can start to pile up the more you change jobs. And so can the number of investment providers you have relationships with. It could become a hassle to keep up with those tax-deferred accounts along with your IRA and taxable investing accounts. Those may also be held with different investment providers. How can you streamline all of it to reduce the clutter? Morningstar Inc.’s Director of Personal Finance Christine Benz explains how in this excerpt from her webcast—“5 Steps to Spring-Cleaning Your Investment Portfolio.”

3 Reasons Why Investors Should Streamline Their Accounts

Christine Benz: The first step in this process in terms of streamlining your portfolio is to take a hard look at all of your investment providers as well as your investment accounts. So, the advantages of doing so again gets back to reducing oversight, reducing your recordkeeping responsibilities. One is purely logistical, that you’ll have fewer passwords and portals to have to keep track of. That gets to be a pain if you have a lot of different investment providers and a lot of different accounts. Keeping those passwords safe and making sure that you have access to them gets to be a bit of a pain in the neck. So, it’s helpful to reduce the number of investment providers. And it simplifies tax season, as I said.

And then one factor that I think probably doesn’t get enough play is that if you are able to have accounts sitting side by side, it really expedites the transfer process. An example would be: I’m someone who is still in accumulation mode for retirement, so I have my taxable account sitting right alongside my IRA accounts. When the calendar page turns, and I’m able to make an IRA contribution for the new tax year, it’s as simple as just a couple of mouse clicks and I’m able to transfer money from our taxable account right into those IRAs.

So, it helps when you’re in the accumulation mode, and it also helps when you’re in the decumulation mode. If you’re drawing down your portfolio during retirement, and you want to periodically transfer from your tax-deferred accounts or perhaps you’re on the hook for required minimum distributions, it’s helpful to have those accounts sitting side by side where your tax-deferred account is sitting right alongside your taxable account, and you can periodically do those transfers. Just a logistical advantage to having fewer providers and fewer investment accounts and, to the extent that you have multiple investment accounts, having them siloed with a single provider.

How Low Can You Go With Retirement Accounts?

The question is “How low can you go in terms of reducing the number of investment providers and the number of accounts?” Well, in terms of investment providers, you can go quite low. You could go all the way down to one, especially if you’re retired. If you are talking about investment accounts, there’s only so far you can go with this streamlining process. And the key reason is the tax code, that we all have multiple accounts that need to be kept distinct for tax reasons.

If you have traditional tax-deferred accounts that consist of pretax dollars that you’ve put in and investment earnings, these are funds that you’ve never paid taxes on, so they need to be kept separate. And you might have Roth IRAs. Increasingly, younger investors have more dollar amounts in Roth accounts, but those Roth accounts need to remain distinct from your traditional tax-deferred accounts. And then if you’re part of a married couple, well, those accounts that you each own in your own names for your own retirement, they need to remain distinct as well. So, some of those retirement accounts have to remain distinct due to the tax code.

The same goes for single-purpose tax-sheltered accounts. College savings plans, 529 assets, for example, can’t be rolled into your IRA. Health savings accounts need to remain distinct. And the same goes for taxable accounts. So, there’s only so much consolidation that you can do at the account level, but you can still do some consolidation.

How You Can Consolidate Tax-Deferred Accounts

One of the key opportunities if you’re looking to streamline is to look at all of the traditional tax-deferred accounts that you hold. And I mentioned that the typical worker has 12 jobs, so many people have leftover 401(k)s perhaps left behind at the old company, or they have rollover IRAs at various firms. These accounts together represent a major consolidation opportunity, where oftentimes the best strategy from the standpoint of streamlining is to consider merging all of those accounts together into a single mega IRA. And that makes it super simple to keep tabs on that account, which in many households is the largest account and allows you to silo that account with a single investment provider.

So, at the top of the list, I would take a look at all of the various traditional tax-deferred accounts, make sure that you don’t leave any behind because there are oftentimes smaller accounts that people forget about. Really think back to your employment history and make sure that you’re accounting for all of those traditional tax-deferred holdings.

Consolidate Retirement Accounts With the Same Provider

You can do the same with Roth accounts, where if you have multiple Roth IRAs, you can consolidate them together, collapse them into a single Roth IRA, ideally with the same firm where you’re holding your traditional tax-deferred assets. And the same goes for various taxable accounts. Maybe you have smaller onesie holdings here and there. That’s a great opportunity to consider merging those together.

As a side note, I would just say that if you’re doing a direct transfer of holdings into another provider, you wouldn’t typically trigger any tax implications. So, you just want to have those providers do a direct transfer to one another. You don’t want to take possession of a check, for example. You’d want to just have that transition be fairly seamless. So, this shouldn’t entail any tax consequences at this point.

I do want to make a note. I mentioned that oftentimes, especially with those company retirement plan assets, the old rollover IRAs, often creating a supersize IRA is a great course of action. But there are a couple of reasons why you’d want to think twice about this. Ideally, you would get some advice from a financial advisor before proceeding.

But a couple of reasons to consider leaving assets behind in a company retirement plan and potentially even rolling assets into that company retirement plan: One would be if for whatever reason you need extra creditor protections. Oftentimes company retirement plans are covered by better creditor protections than is the case for IRAs. And this depends on the state where you live and the laws in place in the state where you live. But check that if creditor protections are a concern. Another consideration would be if for whatever reason you have a gold-plated 401(k). Maybe it’s ultralow cost where you have very few administrative expenses. You have super cheap funds in the plan. Maybe you even have some custom funds that you really like. Those are considerations to potentially leaving assets behind in the company retirement plan or even rolling assets into the plan.

One other consideration would be if there are investment types that you just can’t find in the context of an IRA. So, a really big category would be what are called stable-value funds, which typically offer higher yields than you can earn on a money market mutual fund or on a high-yield savings account. But they have some insurance coverage that essentially stabilizes their net asset values. Those can be attractive investment types for people to bring into retirement, especially.

Another fund type that is specific to people who are covered by the Thrift Savings Plan for US government workers would be what’s called the G Fund, which is kind of a cashlike account. So, it guarantees stability of principal, but it offers a bondlike yield. The G Fund is really a gem in the Thrift Savings Plan lineup, and the Thrift Savings Plan is great overall. So, if you are a government worker and you are looking for safety but a higher yield than what is available on a cash account, oftentimes it’s a potential reason to think about staying in the TSP, rather than pulling the money out and moving it into an IRA. So just some considerations to bear in mind before you really take this mega IRA idea to heart.

The Week Ahead in Markets

Hampton: We’re trying something new on Investing Insights. We’re going to give you the markets brief for the week ahead.

Here’s next week’s rundown: Three retailers are expected to reveal what’s going on with consumer spending: Lowe’s is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Aug. 20. Target is set to follow on Wednesday, Aug. 21. Macy’s is due to update investors on that date as well.

Here’s What to Expect From Macy’s Upcoming Earnings

Now, let’s take a deeper look at the New-York based retailer ahead of earnings. Macy’s is working on revitalizing its brand and lifting sales. It recently rejected a takeover offer from activist investors who wanted to take the company private. It has shifted back to its turnaround plan where a focus on luxury is part of the strategy. I spoke with David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar Research Services, about the company.

Thanks for being here, David.

David Swartz: Thank you for having me.

What Investors Want to Hear From Macy’s CEO

Hampton: So let’s start with Macy’s is scheduled to report next week. What updates are you hoping to hear from CEO Tony Spring and his team?

Swartz: Tony Spring took over CEO earlier this year, and he unveiled a new program called Reinvent. It’s Macy’s third major strategic plan really in the last few years. And Macy’s is probably going to give us an update on how the Reinvent plan is going. Reinvent is based on a few major endeavors. Macy’s is trying to increase its sales of luxury products and its sales through its subsidiaries, Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury. Macy’s is also closing some underperforming stores, but investing more into its better stores to try to make them more productive and draw more customers.

What Tanked Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management’s Offer to Macy’s

Hampton: Macy’s said Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, their takeover offer came with uncertainty and they turned it down. What tanked that offer, and do you think Macy’s made the best decision?

Swartz: Originally, Arkhouse and Brigade offered $21 a share for Macy’s last year. Macy’s was hesitant to sell to the group or in fact even deal with them at all because Macy’s management was concerned that Arkhouse and Brigade were mostly interested in monetizing Macy’s real estate rather than fixing its retail operations. Over the last few months, Macy’s did make an effort to work with the group and gave them access to due diligence information. Eventually, Arkhouse and Brigade increased their offer to $24.80 per share, which is close to our $25 per share fair value estimate. However, Macy’s then decided that it was going to terminate discussions because it was concerned that the group did not have the financing in place to actually close the acquisition.

Macy’s Is Focusing on Luxury Sales

Hampton: Now, you mentioned earlier about the focus on Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury stores, and these are luxury locations, and that Macy’s is looking to close underperforming stores. Who’s the shopper that Macy’s is hoping to attract and why?

Swartz: Macy’s has been struggling for many years, and one of the reasons is that middle-income shoppers have a lot of other places to shop, and Macy’s is really designed as a mall-based store for middle-income consumers. And so Macy’s is hoping that if it increases its sales to higher-income consumers by increasing its luxury sales, it can perhaps go to a part of the market that isn’t quite as crowded and that it can stand out among its many other peers that sell apparel. And so Macy’s is trying to increase its sales through its subsidiaries, Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury.

Macy’s Stock Outlook Ahead of Earnings

Hampton: Now, what’s your outlook on Macy’s stock ahead of them reporting earnings next week?

Swartz: Earnings probably will not be anything too spectacular. I’m expecting just a small profit of $0.30 a share in the quarter. But I think investors will be more interested in hearing what Macy’s has to say about the back-to-school season and the holiday season. Those are important seasons for any retailer and certainly for Macy’s, as a retailer that sells a lot to parents. The back to school season, the holiday season are very important. And so I think we’re going to get some more information on the outlook for that. Also, we should get more information on how the Reinvent plan is going and how the remodels are going and Macy’s other efforts.

Hampton: And what’s your outlook on the stock?

Swartz: Right now, I think Macy’s stock is undervalued. My fair value estimate is $25 a share, and Macy’s stock in the midteens I think is trading at a pretty low valuation.

Hampton: Well, everyone listening and watching, be sure to check out Morningstar.com next week to read David’s reactions to Macy’s earnings. Thank you for coming to the table, David.

Swartz: Thank you.

Note: This article is part of Morningstar's February 2016 Tax Relief Week special report.

Company retirement plans and IRAs offer tax breaks. So do 529 college-savings plans and health-savings account.

But a plain old taxable account deserves a slot in investors' portfolios, too. Liquidity--the ability to tap assets at any time and for any reason--is the key attraction; you wouldn't want to have to raid your IRA each time you had a car repair or big vet bill.

Moreover, the tax effects of investing inside of a taxable account are arguably pretty light relative to historical norms. Although long-term capital gains rates have begun to creep up on the high end--the highest-income investors now pay a 20% rate--most investors pay 15% on their long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, and those in the lowest income bands pay no taxes on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. True, you'll pay your ordinary income tax rate on securities like bonds and cash. But yields are so low right now that the tax bite--in dollar terms--of holding those securities inside a taxable account isn't that great. And in any case, you can circumvent at least part of the tax burden by holding municipal bonds.

Yet, as simple as investing inside of a taxable account might seem, enhancing your take-home return entails sidestepping a few key pitfalls. Here are some key traps to avoid when investing taxable assets.

1) Using Past Tax Efficiency to Predict Future Tax-Friendliness

Morningstar provides a useful suite of data for investors holding mutual funds in taxable accounts, including tax-cost ratios, which summarize how much investors in the highest tax bracket would have paid to own a fund over various time periods. But there are no guarantees that a once tax-friendly fund will remain so.

its escalating tax-cost ratios

, is that this once-tax-efficient fund has been anything but in recent years. This illustrates that investors in search of tax-efficient equity holdings should opt for funds that are structurally tax-efficient, such as broad-market ETFs and exchange-traded funds and tax-managed funds, rather than relying on backward-looking measures of tax efficiency to guide their choices.

2) Assuming ETFs Will Be Much More Tax-Friendly Than Index Funds One of the key attractions of exchange-traded funds is their tax efficiency, making them a natural choice for taxable accounts. And it's true that ETFs do have some tax advantages that index funds don't have. For one thing, the ETF portfolio manager doesn't have to sell shares to meet investor redemptions, as shareholders trade with one another; thus, broad-market equity ETFs tend to distribute few capital gains. But ETFs aren't necessarily much more tax-efficient than traditional index funds, because the two product types share an important commonality: the very low turnover associated with their index structure. Thus, both equity ETFs and index funds will tend to be quite tax-efficient, provided they track indexes that remain stable over time. (Vanguard's total U.S. stock market index fund/ETF pairs show that the traditional index fund has actually been a hair more tax-efficient than the ETF, in part because the firm's ETFs are share classes of the original index funds.)

Moreover, bond investors should note that an ETF doesn't bestow any tax-efficient magic upon its investors. The main tax-efficiency benefit of holding ETFs is on the capital gains front; bond investors, meanwhile, have to pay ordinary income tax on their income distributions no matter where they hold their bonds. (Holding municipal bonds, whose income is exempt from federal and in some cases state and local taxes, is the only way to lessen the tax burden of bonds inside of a taxable account.)

3) Mishandling Impending Capital Gains Distributions Fund investors have heard that they should avoid ""buying the distribution""--purchasing a mutual fund toward the end of a given year, when funds tend to distribute any capital gains they've realized in the prior year. That's good advice. But well-meaning investors can also compound their tax pain when they unload a fund they already own before it makes a distribution. That's because fund shareholders can owe capital gains taxes on their funds in two ways: first, if the fund makes a capital gains distribution, and second, if the investor sells a fund that has increased in value since purchase. If you wanted to lighten up on a fund position, by all means pre-emptively sell before your fund makes a distribution. But if you want to hang on, selling before a distribution can trigger an even bigger tax headache by prompting you to realize your own capital gains.

4) Not Using Distributions to Increase Your Cost Basis If you do receive and reinvest a distribution from a fund that you own in a taxable account, make sure that you've properly accounted for it by increasing your cost basis. That way, you won't pay taxes on that distributed amount twice: first, when you received it, and second, when you sold your holding. Fund companies are now required to calculate cost basis for their shareholders; but if you owned a fund prior to the rules going into effect in 2012, you'll need to have a paper trail documenting your distributions.

5) Not Harvesting Losses and Gains One of the advantages of a taxable account is the ability to harvest tax losses; that's cumbersome if not downright impossible to do in an IRA or company retirement plan. By selling depreciated securities, you can use that tax loss to offset capital gains or up to $3,000 in ordinary income; unused losses can be carried forward into future years. Yet, many investors don't take advantage of tax-loss selling, perhaps because they believe it's tantamount to admitting a mistake (it's not) or because they think the depressed tax-loss candidate has good rebound potential. To address the latter hesitation, investors could swap into a like-minded (but not identical) security instead. For example, they could buy an ETF that heavily emphasizes the same sector in which a depressed stock resides, or they could buy an index fund in lieu of an actively managed fund in the same style box square.

On the flip side, investors who are currently in the 10% or 15% tax brackets can take advantage of the 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains to harvest gains. By selling appreciated securities and then immediately rebuying them, they can reset their cost basis to a new, higher level. That way, if the tax laws change or they're in a higher tax bracket down the line, they'll owe a lower tax bill when it comes time to sell.

6) Not Using Specific Share Identification for Cost Basis Investors can choose a number of different cost-basis calculations for their accounts. The default method for many mutual fund companies is simply averaging together all purchase prices, but that produces fewer opportunities for loss and gain harvesting. Instead, a cost-basis election called specific share identification enables investors to cherrypick the most advantageous lots of a security to sell--those with the highest cost basis--while leaving lower-cost-basis lots intact. This method will tend to afford the most flexibility and precision for tax-loss or tax-gain harvesting.

7) Not Getting That Money Invested If the Pool Is Big Enough For many investors, their taxable accounts start out as a parking place for liquid assets: the place where they hold their emergency fund and whatever assets they need for ongoing household maintenance. But thanks to a few bonuses, a random inheritance, or simply a high savings rate, their taxable accounts may grow a lot larger than they intended. The mistake, in that case, is to allow an outsized chunk of money to sit idle in cash. Instead, it's better to hold only as much in cash as you need for near-term expenses and invest the rest in line with intermediate- or long-term goals and in a tax-efficient manner.

8) Not Using Highly Appreciated Shares for Charitable Giving Congress' decision to make the qualified charitable distribution (QCD) permanent in late 2015 was big news for charitably minded investors who are post 70 1/2 and, therefore, subject to required minimum distributions from their IRAs. But an equally if not more advantageous strategy for the charitably inclined is to make charitable donations of highly appreciated securities held in a taxable account. You not only receive a tax deduction on the donated securities, based on their current value, but you also remove the tax burden of those highly appreciated assets from your account.

9) Not Being Savvy About Dividends

Since 2003, dividends have been taxed favorably--in line with long-term capital gains. But not every dividend earns favorable tax treatment: Nonqualified dividends, such as those from REITs, are dunned at your ordinary income tax rate, as are the dividends from many hybrid securities like preferred stock. If you're attracted to a stock, mutual fund, or other security because of its high yield, read the fine print to ensure that it's tax-friendly before plugging it into your taxable account. Some otherwise-fine funds with nice dividend yields, such as

nonqualified dividends increase the drag of taxes on their returns

.

10) Assuming You'll Never Pay Tax on Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds are generally exempt from federal taxes, and if you buy a muni bond from your home state and/or municipality, you may be able to circumvent state and local taxes, too. But not every municipal bond or fund will skirt taxes altogether. If you own a private-activity bond, or your fund does, the income from those bonds is subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax even as other muni types are not. That's one reason why AMT-subject investors should look for non-private-actvity bonds or, if they're investing in funds, opt for those with ""tax-free"" in their names.

529 Education Savings Plans That Receive Top Marks

Looking for a way to tax-consciously invest for future educational expenses? A top-rated 529 plan could be an answer.

During the April tax season, many families review their financial profiles and consider contributions to a tax-advantaged investment account. One such option is a 529 education savings plan. Overseen by individual states and available through two channels—either sold by advisors or available directly to individual investors—they encourage savers to put money aside for future qualified education expenses with some enticing tax advantages. Depending on the state and the plan, contributions may be tax-deductible. While invested in a 529 plan, earnings accumulate tax-free and withdrawals are not taxable when used to pay for qualified education expenses, such as tuition and relevant books, supplies, and equipment.

But with 90 or so plans to choose from, which are the most compelling options? Morningstar rates 62 plans, and only three currently earn a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold. This top-level rating is based on an assessment of four underlying pillar inputs: People, Process, Parent, and Price. The individual pillars consider best-in-class industry practices that, when rolled up to the Morningstar Analyst Rating for 529 Plans, reflect our confidence in the plan’s potential to provide participants with a thoughtfully structured and risk-aware process that generates compelling performance relative to peers. Plans with Above Average People ratings have skilled investment teams with experience managing multi-asset strategies. For the Process Pillar, we look for plans that follow what we believe to be best practices, offering age-based or target-enrollment options that utilize a well-researched asset-allocation approach and a robust process for selecting underlying investments. The Parent rating is based on our evaluation of the state agency offering the plan and its ability to provide thoughtful oversight and stewardship. The Price rating considers the fees of the investment options that comprise the plan, relative to its appropriate Morningstar Category peer. We emphasize fees charged by a plan’s age-based or target-enrollment options, which tend to be the more-popular choice among 529 participants.

The three plans with Gold ratings are available directly to individual investors and are listed in Exhibit 1. Each offers a well-designed age-based or target-enrollment series, which are set-it-and-forget-it investment options that gradually de-risk during the accumulation and savings period. These series can serve as a default choice for most investors, similar to a target-date series for retirement savers. These Gold-rated plans also employ a solid menu of static options of mutual funds and/or exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to individual asset classes and a safe vehicle to park cash, such as an FDIC-insured savings account.

Exhibit 1 Morningstar's Gold-Rated 529 Plans
Utah Offers Flexibility

Utah’s my529 has consistently been one of our favorite offerings. The 10-portfolio series employs a progressive glide path, in which the equity allocation is gradually trimmed (four times a year) over an investor’s time horizon, starting at 100% equities at age 4 and landing at 10% in the Enrolled portfolio. The underlying lineup of four Vanguard index funds and two principal preservation vehicles provides broad exposure with no frills. This design earns it an Above Average Process rating. This gradual shift is an industry best practice, as it helps education savers avoid the risk of meaningfully shifting out of equities just after a market dip, when there is the potential to lock in losses. The fees for these portfolios are low, at 0.14%-0.15%.

The my529 team boasts topnotch resources, underpinning a High People rating. A dedicated group of roughly 75 professionals handles everything from portfolio management to recordkeeping. The team also receives support from an investment advisory committee and multiple independent consultants. These additional resources and insights keep the plan ahead of 529 peers. We rate the state parent High: Its centralized oversight structure allows for engaged stewardship of the plan, and the state has earnestly continued to reduce fees.

One distinctive feature that is offered only by the Utah plan is the ability to create a custom series in which investors design their own glide path and select the underlying investments. The investment menu includes 22 options, such as Vanguard index funds and DFA funds that cover broad asset classes, style and size, and strategies with a sustainable investment focus. Given the degree of customization for this option, it is suitable for experienced investors or those who work with an investment advisor. The fees are higher for these portfolios and range from 0.14% to 0.49%.

Michigan Is Straightforward at an Attractive Price

Michigan Education Savings Program is notable for offering an easy-to-use, straightforward series with extremely low average fees of 0.10%. Michigan also employs a progressive glide path, but one slightly flatter than Utah's, as it starts with an 80% equity allocation and lands at 20% by college enrollment. (This can result in some performance differences depending on the market environment.) This shape is influenced by the historical average age of the beneficiary when the account opens. This prudent approach aids investors who may have delayed saving for education expenses and supports a High Process rating. The enrollment-date portfolios hold mostly index funds, with a slightly more diversified lineup relative to Utah, as it also includes REITs, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and high-yield bonds.

This plan was designed via an effective collaboration between the Michigan Bureau of Investments and its dedicated program manager TIAA-CREF, which underpins an Above Average People rating. Michigan, with its investment staff, conducts in-house research and taps participant studies to make informed investment decisions on behalf of beneficiaries. Their dedication to shaping a simple, low-cost plan around their participants’ evolving needs also supports a High Parent rating.

Illinois Provides a Full Gamut of Choices

The Illinois’ Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings Plan offers two different age-based series: one that uses only low-cost Vanguard funds and a multifirm one that employs a blend of active and passive strategies. The index series is cheap, with portfolio fees of 0.11%-0.12% and the blend portfolios charging 0.20%-0.41%. The blend series offers a broader mix of asset classes, providing slightly more diversification relative to its index series, as well as those from Michigan and Utah.

The state Treasury office teamed up with Wilshire Associates to design and run this plan. For both series, the glide path is available at three risk levels: aggressive, moderate, and conservative. They start with equity allocations of 100%, 90%, and 80%, respectively. The Utah and Michigan glide paths tend to fall somewhere between Illinois’ aggressive and moderate offerings. The Illinois glide path is stepped; this means the equity allocation is trimmed about once every two years, so it is not as smooth as Utah’s and Michigan’s progressive glide paths. For the index series, the asset-class exposure is similar to that of the Michigan plan. The blend series boasts a strong lineup that includes a number of Gold-rated actively managed funds, such as Dodge & Cox International Stock DODFX and BlackRock High Yield Bond BHYIX. With six well-designed offerings and an excellent lineup of underlying funds, this plan earns a High People and Process rating. We rate the Parent Above Average, which reflects its solid oversight for this plan, as well as the advisor-sold plan.

Conclusion

All three plans offer a compelling menu of options, but with slight differences. Investors who want to choose their risk level (conservative, moderate, or aggressive) and/or want a mix of index funds and highly regarded active funds in their age-based or target enrollment series might consider using the Illinois plan. Those who want a very low-cost, straightforward target enrollment series can chose the Michigan plan. The flexibility offered by Utah, combined with reasonable fees, can be used by more-experienced investors or those working with a professional financial advisor.

This is the first in a five-part series focused on 529 education savings plans.

(Please stay tuned for important disclosure information at the conclusion of this episode.)

Christine Benz: Hi and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Amy Arnott: And I’m Amy Arnott, Portfolio Strategist for Morningstar.

On today’s podcast, we’ll chat with two global asset-allocation specialists, Omar Aguilar from Charles Schwab and Sébastien Page from T. Rowe Price. Omar is CEO and chief investment officer for Schwab Asset Management. Before joining Schwab in 2011, he worked at a variety of firms including Financial Engines, ING Investment Management, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch Investment Management, and Bankers Trust.

Benz: And Sébastien Page is head of Global Multi-Asset Investing at T. Rowe Price, where he oversees a team of investment professionals dedicated to the firm’s multi-asset portfolios. He’s a member of T. Rowe Price’s Asset Allocation Committee, and he’s also a member of the Management Committee of T. Rowe Price Group. Prior to joining the firm in 2015, Sébastien was an executive vice president at Pimco, where he led a team focused on research and development of multi-asset solutions. And he was a senior managing director at State Street Global Markets before that.

Omar and Sébastien, welcome to The Long View.

Sébastien Page: Thank you. Thanks for having us.

Omar Aguilar: Thanks for having us.

Benz: Thank you both for being here. So, we want to talk about the current economic environment and the current interest-rate environment. The sentiment that the Fed would cut interest rates multiple times in 2024 was widespread coming into this year, but the Fed still probably won’t start cutting rates until September. What do you think economists underrated or missed about the economy and employment picture, which were both very strong until we had one slightly disappointing jobs report in August? Omar, let’s start with you.

Aguilar: Well, a big part of the discrepancies in the estimates related to central banks’ monetary policy started with the fact that this cycle is very unique coming out of the pandemic. And I think the biggest miss that most economists had going into this year was the assumption that things were going to play the same way that they used to play in previous business and economic cycles.

Coming out of the recession that we had back in 2020 through covid, we started to see that the strength of corporations’ balance sheets, the strength of the consumer, was something that clearly was going to be very different because of the stimulus that went into the economy back then. As a result, what we started to observe going in through the cycle of our monetary policy had to do that we instead of observing what the traditional cycles were, we observed these rolling recessions where different parts of the economy went into a recession, and then as we started to go in through the beginning of 2024, we’re starting to see the different parts of the economy started to recover. So, we’re starting to see weakness in manufacturing at the end of 2022, then we started to see strength of manufacturing at the beginning of this year, and then we’re starting to see this behavior that changes the dynamic drastically of what a traditional cycle might look like. And therefore, the assumption that we were going to see significant amount of rate cuts was wrong.

The second part of the reason why things were different in terms of the estimates and in terms of actuals of the Fed is that nobody expected that inflation was going to be as high and sticky as people actually observed. So, the fact that the Fed was looking at the levels of inflation that we observed and then was clear that was going to stay with a tight monetary policy until we saw those inflation numbers come down was another reason why the estimates in terms of number of cuts and the timing on cuts was actually going to be different.

Arnott: Sébastien, maybe we can direct this next question to you. Can you remember any other time when the conventional wisdom about the economy was as wrong about rate cuts as it was in 2024?

Page: I like that question. Those projections are usually wrong. You can go back in time, look at what the projections were at any point in time and see how wrong they were consistently. So no, it’s not that surprising.

To pick up where Omar ended, at the end of 2023, for the last three months, if you took the month-over-month CPI, we were running at 2% inflation. So, to your earlier question, at that time we had six, seven rate cuts priced in. So, my one answer to your earlier question is inflation. Economists got it wrong because then January, February, March, you take those three months, you take the headline print month over month, and we were running at 4.5%. So, I think commodity markets, the commodities, the housing, the services, they all surprised a bit on the upside. As Omar said, it’s the stickiness of inflation. That was a big part of that miss.

I’ll say another thing about getting economic forecasts wrong. It’s been difficult because of the pandemic. The stimulus has distorted all the models. And I think in general, as an industry, we often look at year-over-year changes. But if you’re coming down from unprecedented stimulus, $20 trillion by some estimates, the year-over-year changes aren’t going to look good. But I think a lot of economists just missed the fact that the economy, while it was decelerating fast, it was still pretty good. So, I’ve been telling my team to not just look at rates of changes in this environment but also look at levels.

And from a really big-picture perspective, I think we all underestimated the economy’s resistance to hikes. If I travel back in time before the Fed started hiking in early ’22, and I say, imagine that the Fed is about to hike by 550 basis points, and you’re going to have a war in Ukraine, and you’re going to have a banking crisis. What do you think is going to happen? I don’t think any economist or investor—this is not to pick on economists whatsoever—would have predicted that by now, it would still be pretty low at 4.3% unemployment. So, the response, those long and variable acts, the resistance of the economy to those hikes has surprised pretty much everybody.

Benz: Can each of you talk about where you were, if we were to be doing this discussion at, say, January 2024, what were you thinking in terms of when the Fed would hike rates and how much?

Page: Well, we thought inflation would be stickier. We looked at the last three prints going into January this year, which showed we defeated inflation, and we positioned our portfolios to be more resilient to sticky inflation. That was our big-picture view at the beginning of the year.

Aguilar: Yeah, we started at the end of 2023 at the beginning of ’24, the full discussion of our fixed-income team was precisely about what we call the analogy between the escalator and the elevator. And the assumption for us was the Federal Reserve raised rates by 500 basis points very quickly. In other words, they took the elevator up. And what that meant is that they were clearly in the process of making sure that they could actually fight inflation fast because they had a precedent that historically, if they waited too long, inflation could actually drive the economy really bad. And at that time, particularly coming out of the Covid recession, the Fed was not going to be in the place of letting inflation drive everything down to the bottom.

And so that elevator, they took the rates. It was very aggressive. It was the most aggressive, if not the most aggressive Federal Reserve tightening that we have seen in history. But our assumption was that because of the level of inflation, because, as Sébastien said, that we realized that the economy and the consumer were less sensitive to changes in rates, we realized that the way on the way down was going to be more like taking the escalator. In other words, our assumption was—we were less concerned about the number of rates but more about the pace on how they were going to actually reduce rates. So, we thought that the process of doing, instead of doing 75 basis points of pop or 50 basis points of pop where they were going to actually need and probably start slowing down as a function of inflation.

The interesting thing about this was really related to the fact that for the most part at the beginning of the year, none of us talk about the labor market. Everybody was talking about the level of inflation, the number of rates, but the unemployment was not in the radar. And that was the same case for the Federal Reserve. In their dual mandate, they assumed that the labor market and the consumers were going to take care of them by themselves, and they only had to do one thing, which is fight inflation with everything they could, and they did. The challenge now is that as we go through this, the unemployment rate started to rise faster when they had it. And as we have seen recently, the inflation and the slowdown in the economy is starting to just get a little faster than what they thought. And therefore, they’re at this point now where they need to make a decision on how fast and how strong they have. So, in other words, they may take the escalator, but they may have to take a couple of floors down by the elevator before they can slow down their pace for reducing rates.

Benz: So, this recent jobs report, which I guess was early August, got some people talking about recession. And I’m curious, Sébastien, maybe you can talk about where you are with respect to recession. Do you think that’s way premature, or do you think it should be part of the discussion at this point?

Page: Growth is slowing, but I don’t think a recession is imminent. And that print is an interesting illustration of looking at the rate of change and where the data comes out relative to expectations, as opposed to the level by prepandemic standards. So, we had two prints that were a little worrisome. We had the nonfarm payrolls, including some revisions, but the nonfarm payrolls come out at $114,000, and then the claims were a bit higher too. But if you go back prepandemic and you take the long-run average of job creation—first of all, the number is positive, so we’re creating jobs. And second, that number is, yes, slightly below average, but not a recession number at all. So, the reaction was, in part because the positioning was really optimistic going into this data, but also this focus on, yes, things are slowing down, rates of changes. Rates of changes, they do matter for sure, especially for unemployment, because when unemployment starts accelerating, it’s really hard to reverse it. It accelerates faster and faster, typically, into a recession. But in the current environment, I don’t think a recession is imminent or slowing.

The last GDP print surprised on the upside at 2.8%. But the market being the market, we tend to forget really quickly the data points. Part of this is created by the Fed being so data-dependent. Then as market participants, we become all data-dependent. And Jerome Powell had to say at the last press conference, look, just to be clear, we’re not data point-dependent. We’re just generally data-dependent looking at the data coming in, but that makes the Fed more reactive. It makes the market more jittery. And you combine that with the unwinding of the Japanese carry trade and the extreme optimistic positioning and sentiment going into it, and you get a pickup in volatility like we’ve seen.

Arnott: So, Omar, is that your take on the economic outlook as well that despite the economy slowing down slightly, a recession isn’t really in the cards right away?

Aguilar: Our view continues to be consistent to this idea of we’re in this rolling recession, rolling recovery structure that we have seen in this cycle where different parts of the economy go into recession and then recover while other parts of the economy get into the different parts of the cycle. And that sort of balances out. And I would probably say the common denominator across this has to do with how strong is the consumer, which represents 65% of GDP, and in general, still focusing on the top end of the consumer that drives a significant amount of that strength and resiliency. As we have said, and that Sébastien also mentioned, a big part of this is that the economy and the consumer seem to be less sensitive. It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s completely neutral to interest-rate changes, but at the same time, they seem to be less sensitive to the changes like it used to be. In many cases, that has to do with the fact that if you think about the majority of consumers today and the housing market, the average mortgage that they are paying, it’s 4%. And if you want to get a new mortgage, it’s around 6.5%. So that tells you a lot about the mechanics that happen in the housing market, but at the same time, it also tells you that the majority of the consumers, they’ve been funding their levels at a much lower rate than what they have to pay.

That doesn’t necessarily apply to all types of the consumers. They actually apply for the majority to the top earners, which is a significant portion of that 60% of GDP, where the bottom part, which is 60% of the lower earners, they only represent 30% of consumption. So, the lower part of the consumer is starting to feel, and they’ve already seen that effect of higher rates, especially higher real rates, but they don’t necessarily take that big of a chunk in terms of the GDP growth and the slowdown. So, we see this slowdown, we see these changes in the economic GDP forecast, but we don’t necessarily think that because of this rolling recession component of different parts of the economy, we necessarily think that this will translate in the traditional recession that we normally have in a cycle.

Going back to something that I think Sébastien said about in terms of how data-dependent we have all become and what the Fed may have to discuss, it is that if you actually go theoretically of what means the Fed needs to do to avoid a recession, they should be cutting right now and they should be in panic. And I will mention two statistics. One is the inversion of the yield curve. We have been in an inverted yield curve for quite some time, and usually that translates into—the next two quarters or the next three quarters will actually end up in a recession. So, if the Fed was fully data-dependent and wanted to avoid the recession, they would have acted already on just that particular number.

And the second one that happened as a result of your question about the last job report we had is what is called the Sahm rule that basically suggested that the three-month moving average of unemployment rate is now more than 0.5% higher from the lowest level that they had in the last 12 months. And therefore, that is a sign of a recession. That’s a theoretical number and that’s a theoretical statistic that I think very few economists follow. But that being said, when you put those together, if you actually want to be completely data-dependent, if you just basically look at data, don’t look at anything that happens and you think that this is the same cycle as before, then the Fed will have jumped at this right away and start cutting rates. That’s not our position. Our position, and we seem to be having this slowdown more consistent with what Sébastien said, and we think that overall, these rolling recoveries will start sooner than what people anticipate.

Benz: Sébastien, I want to follow up with you on one of Omar’s points about housing and its role in all of this. It seems like that is one of the things that is troubling consumers, would-be-home purchasers are in this environment where interest rates are relatively high and mainly inventory is super low. So, can you discuss your perspective on that and how that is feeding into consumers’ perception of where the economy and inflation are currently?

Page: The surprise is that the mortgage rate went all the way up to 7% and even above and the housing market didn’t crash. And Omar described this really well. When rates were low, homeowners refinanced somewhere between 3% and 4%. I do this sometimes at conferences. I did this recently. I was in front of 300 advisors and said, raise your hand if your mortgage rate is below 4.5%. And I get the entire room raise their hand. And by the way, that’s also true for corporations that extended their debt when rates were really low when the Fed funds were at zero or near zero. So, you have less leverage, at least for the household and for corporations, and the effective rate—Omar mentioned it’s 4% for homeowners—it’s also very low for corporations. So, on housing specifically, this was unexpected if you think about it. And what happened was the housing market just froze.

If you have a 3.5% 30-year mortgage, why would you sell your house? You’re going to need to refinance to get your new house at 6.5%. So, the market froze. The supply is just not there. And that’s kept housing costs fairly high. And thus far, it’s made inflation a bit stickier than you would have expected. So, it’s part of the story about why is the economy not being that responsive to 550 basis points of hikes? Well, corporations, households, and notice I’m leaving out government debt, which is very high and worrisome, probably a topic for another question. But households and corporations have still low effective rates.

Arnott: So, we also wanted to talk about asset allocation and portfolio construction a bit. So maybe we can start on the fixed-income side. And we wanted to ask you about the implications of higher yields for investor portfolios. So, as we’re taping this around the middle of August, we still have about 5.5% on the one-month T-bill, almost 4% on the 10-year. Do those types of yields mean that the typical investor should hold more in bonds than a couple of years ago? Maybe you can tackle that one, Sébastien.

Page: The answer is yes in conservative portfolios. And that’s just math, if you think about it. So, imagine that you’re a fairly conservative income-oriented investor, and rates are still at zero. And based on the risk you’re willing to take, it’s reasonable for you to have, say, a 5% target return. So, you’re basically a very conservative investor. Well, when rates were at zero or near zero, very low for fixed income in general, even if you didn’t really have the risk tolerance for stocks, the only way to get to 5% was to actually buy stocks. But now that the T-bill is at 5%, you can get your 5% without buying any stock.

Does that make sense? It’s really major in conservative portfolios because you typically have a reasonable return target that you can now achieve fully with fixed income. But the thing I want to say though is that if you want long-term capital appreciation and you have a more aggressive return target, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, you still need a healthy amount of stocks. So, to me, the change is much bigger for conservative investors that have reasonable—but reasonable is a relative word; it depends on your time horizon—to have fairly low return targets and low risk tolerance. Then they can get a lot more of their returns from fixed income. But stocks are still really important to long-term portfolio construction, especially if you’re early in your life cycle saving for retirement.

Benz: Yeah, that is very helpful, Sébastien. I wanted to follow up with each of you on that and discuss the implications for your firm’s multi-asset portfolios. Let’s start with you, Sébastien, on that. It sounds like the implications would be mainly for people who are getting close to or in drawdown mode in terms of the equity versus fixed-income allocation for them?

Page: Especially for folks that have a focus on income. But if you allow me a slight tangent, the retirement income space is going through major transformations where you can get income in many different ways with guarantees, should you want guarantees, so annuities; or with a combination of stocks, bonds, and annuities, or with payout capabilities where you take a total return approach and you consistently basically write the monthly paycheck using a payout endowment kind of model. The retirement income space is evolving into a set of solutions. And if you have the right framework and understand the trade-offs between liquidity, longevity risk, and your risk tolerance and so on, you can find the right solution either in a 401(k) plan, increasingly in a 401(k) plan, or outside a 401(k) plan. So, it’s a long answer, a bit of attention, Christine.

The short answer is, for income near retirement, at retirement investors, higher bond yields are great news. They’re great news, all else equal. And yes, in conservative portfolios, they can play a greater role. We haven’t ultimately changed our life cycle models because you also have increased inflation volatility and a need for broader diversification. And we have also a much longer-term horizon that goes through different interest-rate cycles. Tactically, though, if you take a six- to 18-month horizon, right now we’re quite close to neutral between stocks and bonds.

Arnott: So, Omar, we hear from a lot of financial advisors who tell us that one of their biggest challenges today is coaxing investors out of cash with those 5% yields and into bonds, particularly given bonds’ really painful losses over the past few years. What kind of script do you think advisors should use if they’re talking to their clients about moving money from cash into bonds or rebalancing from stocks into bonds?

Aguilar: Well, let me start by just addressing these components. So yes, for the longest time, if you think about an attribution on what was the source of returns for most portfolios, and the typical discussion was the 60/40 portfolio—60% equities, 40% fixed income—was that the majority of attribution related to anything had to do with just equities when interest rates were at zero. As we started to just get into where we are now, and for the more natural part of what you expect out of bonds, we now have opportunities to invest in different parts of the fixed-income curve that we didn’t have before. We are now at the point where we do have the opportunity, and advisors have the opportunity, to have a true asset allocation beyond what it used to be just equities. For the majority of people that were looking to diversify, and what is interesting is when we started to see this volatility in the equity market and in the yields of bonds last week, it was actually finally the correlation between equities and bonds ended up working the way that it is supposed to work, and that’s exactly what you want to have when you build a portfolio.

When you saw that this unwinding of the carry trade, and you saw that the VIX ended up shooting over 60 in a very short period of time, then we started to see that we saw a significant drop in yields that made these bonds look like they were finally doing their job, and that’s exactly what you want when you’re building a portfolio. You want to create that diversification process that allows you to have growth and protection for inflation through equities and other asset classes, but also you want to have that safety in your fixed-income portfolio that allows you to do that.

To specifically answer your question, yes, what we saw as we had the monetary policy being tied too fast is that the majority of clients ended up putting a significant amount of money in cash or short-term instruments. And of course, as Sébastien said, it is very difficult not to convince people to have a 5.25% or 5.5% almost risk-free when you are in a money market fund or when you’re in a simple short-term instrument, an ultrashort bond or so. And that’s obviously very attractive, especially when the credit market is in very good shape. In other words, there is no need for you to increase your credit exposure and still have the benefit of having very attractive yields and having total returns in bonds that actually we haven’t had for a long time.

The challenge right now is because of the earlier discussion about the impending changes in monetary policy when the short part of the curve that, by the way, that’s the part that the Fed controls. The Fed doesn’t control the rest of the curve. They basically control the short part of the curve when we see that the reinvestment risk is getting higher and higher as we get closer to the first rate cut. So, a lot of the discussions that we have had with clients, is that this is the time—and probably two weeks ago was a much better time—to extend duration in their fixed-income portfolio so that they can avoid and reduce their reinvestment risk and still lock in very attractive yields that they can have without necessarily having to take significant credit exposure. Again, a big part of this is looking at the correlation, look at the structure, but still being able to have attractive yields that in combination with exposure in bonds will give them the level of diversification that each one of the risk profiles they need.

Benz: Omar, I would pose the same question to you about the implications of higher fixed-income yields for Schwab portfolios, the multi-asset portfolios that the firm runs.

Aguilar: And I go back to a lot of what Sébastien said, which is there’s two things. One is the two parts that we need to remember and we need to just realize—and this is a big part of the discussion that we have had with our clients—is that the majority of our clients have experienced for the last 15 years an area where there is very little volatility in the market, low risk, plenty of liquidity, interest rates that were, on average, fairly low and very low or limited inflation. That changed in the last 18 months, and what we expect to happen for the foreseeable future is we’re going to have higher interest rates. They’re never going to go back to zero—or hopefully never going to go back to zero because that actually will mean that we have other big issue or another big financial crisis—that we also are going to have levels of inflation that are also going to be more consistent to what history was and they’re not going to go down to the low levels that we had had in the past. And therefore, for any parts of our glide path or any type of our multi-asset strategies that depends on the time horizon that clients have, they have to put areas of focus on risk that they didn’t have to focus on before.

So, for one, they need to understand what is the level of inflation that they’re going to have and how that’s going to impact, especially for those that are close to retirement or in retirement. If anything else, when you actually think about multi-asset strategies for those clients that are very close to retire or they are in the first years of retirement, inflation and income and real income becomes the biggest risk that they have because they’re going to run out of money. I think especially because where we are in the society and the majority of these pension plans, we actually need to continue to help clients protect and be able to just have that because inflation could really make big changes into how their lifestyle goes in retirement if they don’t necessarily have the right portfolio in their strategy.

So, inflation is one area that we continue to work. We’ll need to continue to do more work around it because what that means, they cannot just be in fixed income or in cash. They need to have some equities. They need to have some real estate. They need to have other inflation-protected assets that allows them to just continue to grow part of their pot even when they’re in retirement. So, the glide path is slightly different than what it was five or 10 years ago precisely because inflation is not going to go down to zero.

The second part of this is because the yields are higher, as Sébastien said, where do you source your income is now a more interesting and a much better opportunity for most people. Whether it is you actually doing through equities, through fixed income, through REITs, through some other more absolute return type of strategies that allows you to keep that level of volatility low so that you don’t necessarily sacrifice your balance but allows you to have more consistency in your income is a big of the game. This is what sounds like a little bit of a nuisance, and sorry for the technical details, but when you started to just look at the allocation, especially for people in retirement, it’s less about how much volatility you see in your balances. In other words, how much they change on your balance than when you look at your accounts are like and more about how more certainty you have in your income. In other words, the payment check that you’re going to receive every month to pay your rent or buy your groceries, to go to the doctor, that is more important than having to change things on a more regular basis.

Benz: Such an important point there. Omar, I want to follow up with you on inflation protecting that income stream that a retiree might be drawing from his or her portfolio. You mentioned a few assets—equities, real estate. I’d like to ask specifically about inflation-protected bonds. And one thing I think a lot of retirees grapple with is of the fixed-income allocation, how much of that should go into TIPS and perhaps I bonds? Do you have a house view on that question? How should investors triangulate it?

Aguilar: Well, TIPS are a great way to have that combination of inflation protection and allocation. The challenge with this in terms of just breakevens and volatility is that obviously TIPS don’t necessarily get you the immediate inflation hedge. It basically tends to average over time, and they get you what you have when you get your coupons.

Our house view on TIPS is that you need to have TIPS as a component, especially as you get closer to retirement and still increasing your allocation as you go into retirement, but they don’t necessarily need to be all the allocation that you have. And the challenge it also becomes is that you need to just complement your allocation to TIPS to other parts of fixed income so that you can have a comprehensive, maybe higher nominal yields, with some components that have real yields in terms of the TIPS and what you have in breakevens.

Arnott: We wanted to shift to the equity side and Sébastien, T. Rowe Price’s Target Date series have had a persistent overweighting in stocks compared with some other target-date fund offerings. Can you talk about the thinking behind that positioning and at what life stage does your team start meaningfully ratcheting down that equity exposure within the target-date funds?

Page: That’s a great question. We have two series—one that’s higher equities, one that’s lower equities. So, we’re a solutions provider in target-date strategies and we have a wide range of capabilities blending active and passive, active only, and so on. But our flagship has a fairly healthy allocation to stocks, and I talk about this in my book. It has to do with the time horizon. And when you ask people how much stocks do you think you should own depending on how far you are from retirement? Well, the first answer is every situation is unique. But if you bear with me and think about broad averages or very simple guidance or modeling, the answer is often more than you think. I’m 47 years old and for me it’s 80%-plus in stocks because Omar hinted at this, once you retire, nowadays you can live another 30-plus years—hopefully, if all goes well, if you stay healthy.

So, when you have a long time horizon like this and you want the power of compounding to work for you, the definition of risk is very different. It’s not month-to-month volatility. It’s longevity risk. How many years will my savings last? It’s the level of payments you can generate once you’re in retirement to Omar’s point. The income component. It’s the liquidity component. It’s a combination of these different factors. And when you put them all together, the empirical research shows that a fairly healthy allocation to stocks is more likely to lead to better retirement outcomes if you’re willing to take the month-to-month volatility, which I would argue if you’re far enough from retirement or even in retirement, you should be willing to take some of that because it’s one of the trade-offs that you can get paid for.

It decreases once you’re close to retirement. We now have an innovation in our target-date strategies where we add some tail-risk hedging component to the equity part of the portfolio when you get close to retirement to protect the downside a bit more directly as you start converting your savings into income. And I’ll just leave it at that and say that you know this whole life cycle investing, it is, as Bill Sharpe said, the thorniest, hardest problem in finance. How do you generate income from your savings? And it’s fascinating how it’s evolving in many different directions into really—well, one thing I want to convey to you all and to your audience is there is no single solution for life cycle investing and especially for drawing income from your savings. It’s really about where you are. It’s about personalization ultimately.

Benz: Omar, I wanted to follow up on the current time period for equities. US stocks have had quite strong gains for the year to date in 2024. The question is, do you think that US stocks are expensive currently or do valuations look more attractive to you now that we’ve had a little bit of volatility in the equity market?

Aguilar: Well, a great question, and one that I think we have discussed extensively throughout this year. And I’ll mention a few things. One is, when you look at equities as an asset class and you look historically and you look at the traditional metrics that people look for evaluating whether equities are expensive or not, they look above average in terms of valuation. In other words, if you just close your eyes, look at what the indexes have and say, hey, based on history, where we are relative to the distribution of either multiples or valuation metrics, whatever is your best one that you want, definitely they look more expensive than what history may suggest for their own history.

When we tend to advise our clients and discuss with our clients, and we would like to discuss this with advisors as well, is to say, well, but equities are just one asset class that you need to put into context with the rest. And that’s when we start discussing the concept of equity risk premium. And what that means is, are the valuations or equities relative to bonds something that is still attractive for you for the risk you’re going to take? And when you look at historically, the equity risk premium is not at the level of being above average of what you would expect. What that suggests is that given—especially over the course of the last couple of months—that fixed-income assets actually tend to be a little more expensive than equities at the moment when you compare one versus the other. In other words, what that suggests is that there is still a good opportunity for you to have that diversification by providing and have a healthy allocation to equities. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to just be completely overweight or doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to be underweight because your concept is that valuations are above average.

The other component that I want to mention—which is critical for this—is that is if you look at the indexes and the challenge with the indexes, especially as we know this year is that the heavy concentration in the top 20% of stocks has actually created the illusion that equities are expensive. Not too long ago, and actually after the events of the unwinding of the current rate is actually more extreme, there were 70% of the stocks in the S&P 500 that had negative returns for the year. Even though the indexes overall were very positive and close to 15%-20%, not all individual securities and individual sectors ended up having the same level of performance for the year. So, what that means is that overall, because of the heavy concentration in a few stocks, that actually creates the illusion that equities have become expensive.

What we tend to emphasize for our advisors and our clients is to say, well, what that means is that you need to look beyond just the mega-caps and the large cap and the traditional definition of equities, which tends to be linked to one or two indexes, and basically look at what do you do with your value exposure? What do you do with your growth exposure? What do you do with your small cap? What do you do with your international? What do you do with emerging markets so that you can actually have an allocation that is robust at all times so that you don’t necessarily look expensive in your equity allocation related to bonds?

So, to answer your question specifically, we don’t necessarily think that equities are expensive at the moment. We actually think that equity risk premium allows you to be more thorough about allocating, but we also don’t think that it’s a good time now to take excessive risk because we expect more volatility in the second half of the year.

Arnott: You mentioned a variety of equity sectors beyond the large mega-cap tech names that are still dominating broad equity indexes. So small-cap stocks, value stocks, international stocks, emerging markets—are any of those areas particularly attractive to you now in terms of valuations?

Aguilar: Our work continues to suggest that having an allocation to small caps, mid-caps, and international, it is a good amount of strategic allocation that needs to happen. And yes, in many cases, theoretical research suggests that when you have lower levels of interest rates that tend to be a positive catalyst for small caps to outperform. We saw that a little bit at the beginning of the summer when we started to see that rotation away from those mega-caps into small caps and mid-caps. And we do expect that overall, that should be a healthy way to suggest that we’re starting to just get into the next phase of the cycle. The same thing goes with the growth and value.

It is interesting because when you take out those Mag Seven securities, the performance of growth and value becomes almost identical. And in other words, there is a significant amount still of impact of those Mag Seven and those mega-caps in that definition of growth and value, which suggests that there is still a good opportunity for that cyclical diversification that allows you to prepare for the next part of the cycle, which suggests to invest in financials and industrials, in materials that usually tend to do better in the early part of the recovery.

Benz: Sébastien, I wanted to ask about international equities, which look attractive relative to US on many measures—valuation, dividend yield. Do you think that many US investors are overly concentrated in US stocks and should think about diversifying internationally? And if you’re making the case to investors about that, what are your talking points there?

Page: The US has an advantage in terms of the dynamism of its economy and innovation and AI and technology that’s not to be underestimated. It also now, because it’s performed so well relative to the rest of the world, represents about 70% of the total size of world stock markets. So, you would expect investors, especially if they’re in the US, but just generally, to have a large allocation to US stocks.

The valuation case has been made before and it’s been a little bit of a value trap. So, you need to ask what would be the catalysts for this rotation? Omar talked about the rotation into small caps. Currently, tactically, we’re neutral between large and small caps. He hinted at the rotation between growth and value. Currently, we’re long value relative to growth. And that also dovetails with we’re actually neutral in international. But if you force me to make the case or push me to make the case, I would say that the valuations just generally for value and Europe is more value-oriented. You have to think about it in terms of sector differences as well. Has some upside as the world economies slow down and we get eventually to the other side. Non-US central banks have been even more aggressive in lowering rates. That could be the catalyst to unlock the valuation advantage. Some emerging markets have been beaten down substantially. And so, the sentiment is so negative that it becomes attractive to take the other side.

Again, that’s if you force me to make the case. I think it’s good to have a strategic allocation that’s closer to say the relative size of the markets, which is where we’re at. But I think it could be part of the whole rotation picture as the massive spend on AI, which by the way, we think is real and is going to lead to productivity gains, but still, it leads to margin compressions. And the market, now investors starting to ask, well, where are the AI application revenues? And as we go through that transition, just generally, whether it’s international, small or value, you’re looking at a situation where the comparables are so high for growth stocks that by the end of 2024, the consensus forecast is that you’ll see for value stocks, including abroad, a year-over-year earnings-growth rate that should outpace the growth stocks. And I don’t think a lot of market participants are really positioned for an improvement in fundamentals, a passing of the baton in the fundamentals.

I’ll say one more thing on valuation. And this applies to international stocks, but also value versus growth stocks. Omar mentioned the market concentration makes the market look expensive. 2021 price/earnings ratio is very expensive by historical standards. I like to tell that story of the statistician who had their head in the freezer and their feet in the oven, but was very comfortable saying, “Oh, I’m feeling great. On average, I’m feeling great.” And this kind of, the 21 is an average of 15 price/earnings ratio for value stocks, which is basically historical average and 30 for growth stocks. So, when you look at market valuation, you’re looking at head in the freezer, feet in the oven kind of bifurcation, which is very, very, very stretched by historical standards. When we were that stretched, in no way do I think we’re in a tech bubble, by the way, because the price/cash flows are much better now for tech companies than they were in the tech bubble. But nonetheless, when you were that stretched between value and growth, in the early 2000, value outperformed by 45% in less than a year. Even in 2022, you had a big snapback of the relative valuation and value outperformed by over 20%. And so, these things can happen pretty quickly when the valuation band is stretched like that.

Arnott: If we look beyond traditional stocks and bonds, Omar, what’s your take on alternative assets? Are there any types of alternatives that you think can add the most value to globally diversified stock and bond portfolio?

Aguilar: Yeah, absolutely. And before I go there, just to confirm and support Sébastien’s view on international, just a couple of data points. There is, normally, because of the composition of the indexes, if you want to diversify away from technology, which most people will have a US exposure, which is heavily tech, the history shows that whenever you see financials, energy, and materials work, you will actually have countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia doing much better than the rest of the world. On top of that, Europe went to an earnings recession in 2023, and the expectations for EPS year-over-year forecast for their growth in 2024 has surpassed the one for the US. Not only that, but in terms of valuations, the average, and I think this is again, go back to what I said before, I think the example that the statistician that Sébastien said, the overall average for international in terms of their P/E ratios is at a discount, whereas the US P/E ratios is at a sizable premium because of those Mag Seven. So, when you think about valuation, when you think about diversification, when you think about just the cycles for earnings growth, clearly you have an opportunity to do more internationally.

In terms of alternatives, we have done a lot of work in terms of thinking of the dynamics of dynamics, especially as a consequence of what we observe in the banking crisis. If you think about it, the way that particularly private credit has worked is the fact that you see as an opportunity for many companies that used to go to these regional banks for financing, that used to go to other areas of the financial sector for being able to get liquidity, that all of a sudden, those things are starting to collapse. That created that big opportunity and that big flow of assets going into private credit. That’s not necessarily going to be the ultimate solution for any liquidity and any credit availability going forward, it does provide an opportunity for diversification for traditional asset classes.

Of course, the challenge in there becomes how do you evaluate the risk and the liquidity associated with that, where we continue to advise and give clients guidance in terms of making sure that they do the due diligence in areas of the private credit, because it’s very hard to just necessarily find that liquidity in that area and all the risk gets transferred. In other words, if you go to alternative investments, the one thing that you need to consider is that liquidity premium that you’re going to have to pay, which is not necessarily something you have to worry when you look in public assets. But that being said, it does provide you with that alternative diversification that we didn’t have before. Private equity and the rest of the alternatives also becomes a good opportunity with the only challenge is that there is too much money there. Therefore, what I think the estimated potential returns going forward needs to be discounted, because, especially with the slowdown of the economy, especially when we are in the cycle, it is going to be very difficult to be able to put to work that much money into the different deals when it comes down to private equity and to other parts of that part of alternative investments. So, it is more about evaluating liquidity risk, evaluating opportunities, but certainly we are in the process of providing clients with advice on how much of their portfolio they can put into alternatives as another source of diversification.

Benz: Well, Omar and Sébastien, I think we have another hour or two worth of conversation left, but we so appreciate the time that you’ve spent with us today. It’s been a really fun and informative conversation. Thank you so much for being here.

“To change one’s life, start immediately, do it flamboyantly, no exceptions.”--William James

James, a psychologist, was right on the money with the ""immediate"" part. But does enacting lasting change in your life need to be momentous or flamboyant? Nah. Instead, most people who have achieved big goals will tell you they've done so little by little, one small step at a time. The person who lost 30 pounds did so by walking an extra mile a day and putting skim milk in her coffee instead of half and half. The author who wrote a best-selling first novel got it done by writing a few pages a night, after he had put his kids to bed.

The same is true when you're aiming to achieve your investing goals. The broad goals of funding a comfortable retirement, paying for college, or buying a first home can seem daunting, particularly when you think through the dollar amounts that you'll need to save. But if you break these broad goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and tackle them one at a time, you can begin to make real progress toward your goals.

In this article I'll coach you on completing one investment task per day, with an eye toward getting in the best financial shape of your life. I'll discuss how to invest for goals that are close at hand, how to build a retirement portfolio, and how to make sure your investments are on track from year to year. In just three weeks, you can be financially fit!

Day 1: Start tracking your expenses Degree of Difficulty: Easy Let's start with a fairly easy task: beginning to track your spending habits. There are Web sites, apps, and financial software programs devoted to helping keep close tabs on your household's cash flows, but tracking your expenses can be as simple as jotting them down whenever you find yourself opening your wallet or writing a check. Group your expenses into one of two main categories: fixed (i.e., spending that doesn't change and you can't do without) and discretionary. Get a start with the Budget Worksheet included here.

Plan to keep track of your expenses for at least a month; that way you can identify patterns in your spending and zero in on your problem spots. Examining cash flows in this way is the first step in creating a budget that aligns with your priorities and the realities of your life. You may also find that tracking your expenditures will have the salutary effect of causing you to think twice before spending money on things you don't necessarily need.

Day 2: Take stock of your assets and liabilities Degree of Difficulty: Moderate Now that you're getting warmed up, it's time to move on to the key task that will show you how you're doing financially: checking up on your net worth.

If you keep good records and don't have many financial accounts, enumerating your assets and liabilities will be pretty straightforward and shouldn't be time-consuming. You've got more work ahead of you if your records and portfolio are in a state of sprawl, but think of this as your impetus to streamline and get organized.

You don't need to get especially fancy; get started with the Net Worth Worksheet included here. To document your assets, simply retrieve your latest account balances and estimate the worth of your personal possessions, including real estate. On the other side of the ledger, record any debts you owe, including your mortgage; student, home equity, or auto loans; and credit card balances. Subtract your liabilities from your assets and you're looking at your net worth.

If your net worth is negative or barely positive, you've got your work cut out for you. Creating and sticking to a budget should be a key priority in the years ahead. And even if your net worth is comfortably positive, you should still spend time digging into the numbers. Is most of your money tied up in a single asset, such as company stock or your house? If so, a key goal should be to diversify your financial assets in the years ahead. Do you have an adequate amount--six months' worth of living expenses at a minimum--stashed in an emergency fund? If you don't, prioritize building up your position in ultrasafe (and unfortunately, ultra-low-yielding) investments before investing in longer-term assets like stocks.

Day 3: Check your emergency fund Degree of Difficulty: Easy Before you begin saving for your long-term goals, it's crucial that you build an emergency fund--a basket of ultra-liquid investments that you can tap in case you lose your job or confront an unanticipated car or home repair.

The typical rule of thumb is to keep three to six months' worth of living expenses in your emergency fund. But perhaps a better way to decide how much to store in cash is to think about how much of a cushion you'd like to have in case you lost your job. If you go through that exercise, you're apt to conclude that three months' worth of living expenses is nowhere near enough. But don't go overboard with your cash hoard, either. After all, interest rates on money market accounts and funds are low, so being too conservative has an opportunity cost. As you calculate your emergency-fund requirement, don't use your real spending patterns to set your living expenses. Think about how much you could get by on in a pinch, excluding dinners out, house cleaners, and vacations.

Compare your emergency-fund target with the amount you have saved in CDs, money market accounts and funds, and checking and savings accounts. Don't include cash holdings that appear in long-term mutual funds. Building your emergency fund up to your target level should trump saving and investing for other goals, such as retirement or college.

Day 4: Get maximum mileage from your cash holdings Degree of difficulty: Easy to moderate Everyone needs cash, both for an emergency fund and to cover upcoming expenses such as your property tax bill or college tuition. Keeping that money safe is important, but the big drawback is that yields on CDs, money market accounts, and other cashlike vehicles are about as low as they can go right now.

When shopping for the best yields on cash investments, the list of don'ts is almost as long as the list of dos. While it's smart to be opportunistic and scout around for the best yields, my key piece of advice is not to get too cute. Safety is key for this portion of your portfolio, so resist the temptation to park some or all of your assets into a ""cashlike"" vehicle that offers a higher yield but also a greater risk to your principal. Ultrashort-bond funds and bank-loan funds are a great example of why you shouldn't chase yield: Although some investors had used funds in both categories as a higher-yielding money market substitute, the average fund in these groups lost 8% and 30%, respectively, in 2008's market shock.

CDs usually offer higher yields than money market funds and other cashlike vehicles, and they offer FDIC protection to boot. The big drawback is that you're locking yourself into a fixed term and rate. Money market mutual funds, bank-offered money market accounts, and high-yield savings accounts offered by online banks and credit unions can all buy new, higher-yielding securities if rates move up.

If you're in a high tax bracket, another option for your cash is a municipal money market fund, whose income will be free of federal income tax. Most fund companies have a tax-equivalent yield function on their bond calculators that can help you determine whether you're better off in a muni or taxable money market fund once the tax effects are factored in.

Day 5: Map out your financial goals Degree of difficulty: Easy Most of us have a running list of financial goals: whether it's paying off our homes, financing college for the kids and grandkids, funding a comfortable retirement, or paying for here-and-now creature comforts like vacations and new cars. Few people, however, take time to document their goals and quantify exactly how much they'll cost, even though that step is key to helping you set your household's financial priorities. It's also pretty easy.

Today, take a moment to jot down your goals. Group them into one of three bands: short-term goals (goals you'd like to achieve in five or fewer years), intermediate-term goals (five to 15 years from now), and long-term goals (15 years or more in the future). Once you've done that, prioritize your goals within each time frame. Be sure to include debt retirement on your list of goals.

The next step is to estimate exactly how much those goals will cost you. If your goal is close at hand--such as buying a car next summer--quantifying it is straightforward. But if it's a goal that's further in the future or one that you'll pay for over several years, the calculation may be more complicated and you'll also have to factor in inflation. FinAid's College Cost Projector can help you calculate the cost of college using historic (and historically scary) inflation rates, and Bankrate's Retirement Calculator shows you how much you'll need to save for retirement. Morningstar.com's Savings Calculator is a multipurpose calculator that helps you see the interplay between your current savings, future contributions, and your expected rate of return.

Day 6: Allocate capital like a pro Degree of difficulty: Moderate to difficult Although Morningstar focuses on helping you invest in stocks, funds, and exchange-traded funds, the reality is that investors' highest-impact decisions precede the decision to invest in the market. Do you save enough? And when you have extra cash on hand, do you pay down debt, invest, or do a little of both?

When it comes to the latter decision, it's helpful to think of yourself as a business owner, steering your cash toward the opportunity that is apt to offer you the best return on your capital.

Paying off debt--even more benign types of debt like mortgage debt or student loans--offers you a knowable return on your money--always a good thing. If you're receiving a tax break on your interest, as is the case with mortgage interest and some student loans, you'll get less of a bang out of paying off the note prematurely. But in my experience, many mortgage-holders overestimate the benefits of their tax-deductible interest; later in the life of the mortgage, tax-deductible interest may be a small slice of the overall mortgage payment.

Investing in the market offers a potentially higher rate of return, but the hitch is that return, unlike paying off debt, isn't guaranteed. When forecasting returns for your investments, be conservative. I usually use a 6% rate of return for equities, a 2% return for bonds, and a 1% return for cash. Based on the asset mix of your portfolio, you can then forecast a ballpark return for it. Armed with that information, you can then determine whether investing in the market or paying off debt is the best return on your dough.

Day 7: Invest for mid-term goals Degree of difficulty: Moderate Yes, current yields on truly safe investments like CDs and money market funds are shrimpy. But if you're building an emergency fund or saving for a goal that's close at hand, the risks of venturing beyond ultra-safe investments outweigh any extra yield you're able to pick up. It's boring, but you'll need to rely on your own savings, rather than investment returns, to do the heavy lifting in these instances.

But what if you're saving for an intermediate-term goal and don't expect to need the money for another couple of years or even more? In that case, you can tolerate modest fluctuations in the value of your principal. A core intermediate-term bond fund can fit the bill. A few favorites among Morningstar analysts include

If you have an even longer time horizon--anywhere between five and 10 years--you can hold stocks as well as bonds. Morningstar analysts like

Day 8: Identify the right vehicle for college savings Degree of difficulty: Moderate As with retirement investments, the college-savings landscape is far more cluttered and complicated than it needs to be, with myriad vehicles competing for investors' attention.

Due to their generous contribution limits and the potential for tax-free withdrawals, section 529 college-savings plans have emerged as the vehicle of choice for families looking to sock away a substantial sum for school. 529s have generally improved substantially over the past few years, with costs coming down and the quality of investment options going up. To see how these college-savings plan compare, consult Morningstar's annual 529 Plan Ratings.

Some investors, however, would like to invest for their kids outside the confines of a dedicated college-savings vehicle like a 529 or Coverdell Education Savings Account. If that's you, you have a couple of different options. Setting up a UGMA/UTMA account is one simple way to go, but the drawbacks probably outweigh the pluses, in my view. The assets become the property of the child once he or she reaches the age of majority (varies by state but usually age 18 or 21), when some young people may not yet be equipped to make good financial decisions. And if you're pretty sure your child is college-bound, you should know that those UGMA/UTMA assets will work against your child in financial aid calculations.

For those reasons, investors looking to save outside of a dedicated college-funding vehicle like a 529 or Coverdell should consider saving for their kids in one of a couple ways. The first would be simply to hold tax-efficient investments, such as low-turnover exchange-traded and index funds, individual non-dividend-paying stocks, municipal bonds/funds, or tax-managed mutual funds, within the confines of the parents' taxable account. Withdrawals won't be tax-free, as is the case with qualified withdrawals from a Coverdell or 529, but it's straightforward and investors gain the added flexibility to use the money outside of college expenses, penalty free, if the need arises.

Another option is to use a Roth IRA to save for your kids. In a Roth, you can pull out your contributions (not your gains), tax-free, at any time and for any reason, making the vehicle a great multi-tasker for those looking to save for retirement and college at once. The key drawbacks? Roth contribution limits are pretty low--currently $5,500 for those under 50 and $6,500 for those over--and pulling money out for your kids leaves less money at work for retirement.

Day 9: Invest your college-savings assets Degree of difficulty: Moderate The bear market of 2008 forced many retirees and pre-retirees to recalibrate their plans and, in some cases, to make meaningful reductions in their spending. But it also had a huge impact on another, much younger group: college-bound students. Unfortunately, many college-savings plans, including several professionally run 529s, were far too skewed toward stocks in the later stages of their investment paths coming into 2008, resulting in big savings shortfalls for students getting close to college.

If that experience had a silver lining, though, it was that it underscored the importance of holding on to what you already have versus gunning for big returns in your child's college-savings plan, particularly as college draws near.

Many of the investment pros running 529 college-savings programs have scaled back the equity holdings of their age-based options to make them more conservative, and added index funds in place of poorly chosen actively managed funds, in the hopes of reducing the risk of a big shortfall at the worst possible time. Investors managing the asset allocations of their own college-savings programs should also take the lessons of 2008 to heart.

Here are a few quick tips:

• By the time your child hits the teenage years, more than 50% of his or her college fund should be in bonds and cash.

• By the time your child is a junior or senior in high school, equities should compose only a small slice (less than 20%) of his or her college dough.

• If you have to boost your college savings using a combination of financial aid, student loans, or work-study, it's better than risking the money you have been able to set aside.

Day 10: Decide between Roth and traditional contributions for retirement savings Degree of difficulty: Moderate Investors who are socking money away for retirement are apt to hit a fork in the road: Should they make ""Traditional"" or Roth contributions? Investors in a Traditional 401(k) will be able to contribute pretax dollars to their accounts; investors in a Traditional IRA may be able to deduct their contributions if their income falls below the income limits. (In 2016, individuals earning below $71,000 who can contribute to a company retirement plan at work can make at least a partially deductible IRA contribution; for married couples filing jointly with one spouse who can contribute to a company retirement plan, the threshold for a partially deductible IRA contribution is $118,000 in 2016.) Investors in both Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs can also take advantage of tax-deferred compounding. That sounds compelling, but the downside of building Traditional 401(k) or IRA assets is that the money is taxable upon withdrawal in retirement.

Roth contributions, whether to a 401(k) or IRA, receive exactly the opposite tax treatment: There aren’t any tax breaks on contributions, but the money compounds on a tax-free basis and may be withdrawn in retirement without any taxes, too. (There are no income limits on 401(k) contributions, either Roth or Traditional, but income limits apply to Roth IRA contributions. Single taxpayers can make at least a partial Roth IRA contribution if their income is less than $132,000; for married couples filing jointly, that threshold is $194,000.)

The right answer rests on one big swing factor: whether you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are now. But unless you're quite close to retirement, the answer to that question is all but unknowable.

However, a few categories of individuals are good candidates for making all or at least part of their 401(k) contributions Roth-style. The first would be younger savers who aren't earning a lot currently but may do so in the future. For them, their own earnings trajectory, plus the possibility that future tax rates will trend higher across the board, make a strong argument for a Roth 401(k) and IRA.

Another good candidate for Roth assets is the upper-income individual who has a lot of retirement assets sitting in a traditional 401(k) and/or IRA. Opting for Roth contributions or even undertaking a conversion can give such individuals the opportunity to hedge their bets: If tax rates trend higher in the future, or they’re in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they were in their accumulation years, they’ll be glad they took the hit by making Roth contributions when tax rates were lower.

On the flipside, investors who haven’t saved much for retirement and can make a deductible Traditional IRA contribution may be better off with that type of IRA. It’s unlikely that their tax bracket will be higher than it is when they’re working, so they’re better off pocketing the tax break now.

Day 11: Check up on the quality of your company retirement plan Degree of difficulty: Moderate to difficult If you're earning a match on your 401(k) plan contributions, it's a no-brainer to invest at least enough to earn the match. But what if your company isn't matching, or if you'd like to make a larger contribution to your retirement than you're being matched on? Is it best to stick with the 401(k) or turn to another vehicle like a Roth IRA?

The answer to that question depends, at least in part, on the quality of your plan. To help determine whether your plan is worth investing in or a is a stinker, ask your HR administrator for a document called a Summary Plan Description, which lays out crucial information about your 401(k).

Beware: This document is apt to be crammed with legalese and not likely to be easy reading. But after a little bit of hunting, you should be able to locate your plan's administrative expenses. These fees may be depicted in percentage or dollar terms; if the latter, divide your plan's costs by the total dollars in the plan. If your plan doesn't have any additional administrative costs, that's a good sign. But if it layers on additional administrative fees that amount to 0.50% or more per year, that's a red flag that your plan is a costly one. Check to see whether your plan includes other bells and whistles, such as a brokerage window, which allows you to invest in options outside the plan; the ability to take a loan; and the ability to make Roth 401(k) contributions.

After that, conduct a quick checkup of the breadth and quality of your plan's holdings using the data and Analyst Reports on Morningstar.com. Look for a good array of core-type mutual funds: large-cap U.S. and foreign stock offerings, balanced funds, and core intermediate-term bond funds. For stock funds, look for expense ratios of less (preferably much less) than 1% per year, though specialized funds like international and small-cap offerings may charge a touch more. For bond funds, expense ratios of less than 0.75% are ideal. Read Morningstar's Analyst Reports for a quick checkup on the quality of the options in your plan.

If your plan checks out well on the above measures, funding it up to the maximum allowable level is apt to be a good use of your cash, thanks to the tax-deferred compounding that company-retirement plans afford. Before doing so, however, you should also deploy some of your retirement assets into an IRA. You can start and maintain an IRA with very low to no administrative expenses, and you can also access a broader range of investments than you can when investing inside of a company retirement plan like a 401(k).

Day 12: Maximize your match Degree of difficulty: Easy If you're not earning any matching funds on your 401(k), my usual advice is to fund an IRA up to the maximum allowable level first. The reason is that you can put any investment you'd like into an IRA, and you won't have to pay any additional administrative expenses to invest in one, in contrast with many 401(k) plans. IRA investors also enjoy tax breaks that parallel 401(k)s. If you find yourself with additional assets to invest after that, turn to your 401(k) (provided it's a good one!).

If you are lucky enough to earn matching contributions on your 401(k), plan to take advantage of each and every one of those dollars. This is particularly relevant if you're highly compensated and/or you expect to receive a large bonus early in the year. That's because many companies make matching contributions throughout the year, but if you hit your allowable 401(k) contribution well before year-end, you won't be able to take full advantage of any matching contributions your employer would've made in the remainder of the year. (Some companies make an adjustment to help employees receive a match on their full 401(k) contributions regardless of when those contributions were made, but others do not.)

If this is a potential issue for you, you’ll need to lower your contribution rate per paycheck to ensure that you don’t reach your maximum contribution too early in the year. People who receive large bonuses may be especially vulnerable to missing out on matching contributions; they can usually correct this issue by lowering the percentage of their bonus that goes toward their 401(k).

Day 13: Use an IRA to Improve Your Portfolio Degree of difficulty: Easy If you have most of your retirement assets in a company-retirement plan and are using an IRA to supplement what you already have, you can use your IRA in one of two ways.

You can hold core-type investments, which tend to be mainstays in most 401(k) plans: index stock and bond funds, large-cap actively managed funds, balanced funds, and so forth.

Alternatively, you can use your IRA to fill holes in your company retirement plan. For example, say your plan includes adequate stock funds, but its bond funds charge more than 1% per year in annual expenses--sure to cut into your long-term returns. If that's the case, you can fill your company retirement plan with the decent stock funds and leave the bond portion of your portfolio to an IRA. Morningstar's Instant X-Ray tool can help you see where you've got holes in your existing asset mix.

You can also use your IRA to include asset types not commonly found in company retirement plans, including funds dedicated to real estate investment trusts, commodities, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. All of these investment types do a good job of diversifying a portfolio that's composed primarily of conventional stocks and bonds. They also can be a headache when held outside of tax-sheltered accounts, because they generate a lot of taxable income. So, they're ideal holdings for an IRA.

Day 14: Manage your portfolio for tax efficiency Degree of difficulty: Moderate Although utilizing tax-sheltered vehicles like IRAs and 401(k)s can help you dodge the tax collector, at least temporarily, there are occasions when you'll need to save in your taxable accounts. Perhaps you're socking money away for a goal that's close at hand, for example, or maybe you've maxed out your contributions to the tax-sheltered vehicles available to you.

If that's the case, there are still some steps you can take to reduce the tax effects on these investments.

One of the key steps you can take is to limit your own trading activity, thereby reducing the taxable capital gains you'll owe from year to year. I'm also a big fan of actively pruning your taxable portfolio's losers, which helps you offset capital gains from your winners. Investors who are in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets can do the opposite—pre-emptively selling their long-term gainers and immediately re-buying them. The advantage of that strategy is that it’s tax-free, as those in the 10% and 15% income-tax brackets currently pay a 0% rate on long-term capital gains, and it also increases the investor’s cost basis in her holdings.

Finally, it pays to be careful about what types of investments you hold in your taxable accounts. High-turnover stock funds, whose short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, are a definite ""don't,"" as are high-income-producing investments such as REITs and junk-bond funds.

On the ""buy"" list for taxable investors are low-turnover exchange-traded funds and index funds, municipal-bond funds, individual stocks, and tax-managed funds.

Day 15: Conduct a ""quick and dirty"" portfolio checkup Degree of difficulty: Easy to Moderate A good starting point for a portfolio checkup is to take a snapshot of where your total portfolio is right now, with an eye toward flagging any notable trouble spots. The best tool for the job is Morningstar's Instant X-Ray tool. Simply plug in tickers for each of your holdings (use CASH$ for cash), then hit ""Show Instant X-Ray"" for a look at your portfolio's stock/bond/cash mix and breakdown by investment style, sector, and geographic breakdown.

That's a lot of information, and may not be valuable without some context. To help make sense of what you're looking at, click on the ""Interpreter"" tab under ""Edit Holdings."" As you do so, run through the following checklist and take notes as you go along:

1. Is your stock/bond/cash mix in line with your targets? Take note if your allocation to any one asset class is more than five or 10 percentage points higher or lower than your targets. If it is, it's time to rebalance.

2. Are you making big, inadvertent sector bets? Compare your weightings to the S&P 500's (provided in X-Ray). Again, look for big bets of five or 10 percentage points or more.

3. How about investment-style bets? To help provide a reference point, the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index, a measure of the broad market, recently had the following breakdown in the Morningstar style box: 25% large value, 25% large blend, 24% large growth, 6% in each of the mid-cap boxes, 3% in small value, 3% in small blend, and 2% in small growth.

4. Is a big share of your portfolio in a single stock? To see, click on the Intersection tab. Positions amounting to 5% or more of your total portfolio can ramp up its risk level.

5. Do you have an adequate emergency fund? Make sure you have a bare minimum of three months' worth of living expenses in a cash or cashlike vehicle. (Don’t use X-Ray to gauge your cash holdings because it is likely to overstate them by including cash holdings that appear in long-term mutual funds; you couldn’t access that cash without selling the whole fund, so that money isn’t really liquid.)

If you have extra time, click the individual security names at the bottom of the main X-Ray page to see data and analyses for the stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs in your portfolio.

Day 16: Look for opportunities to streamline Degree of difficulty: Moderate Today's task is one that's relevant to investors of all ages and of all life stages: combating portfolio sprawl.

Diversification is a good thing, of course, but you can also overdo it. It requires time and research to keep track of important developments at stocks and funds, and that task is compounded when you have many different accounts. And the more investments you have, the greater the likelihood that your portfolio will behave like the market. There's nothing inherently wrong with market-like performance, but you don't want to have to pay active management fees when an index fund would have done the job just as well.

So what are some strategies for beating back the sprawl? Index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track a broad market segment are a good place to start if you're trying to streamline your financial life; Morningstar’s mutual fund and exchange-traded fund pick lists include plenty of topnotch core index options.

Alternatively, you could take advantage of all-in-one options, either by using a target-date fund or a stock/bond hybrid fund. And if you're managing multiple accounts geared toward a single goal--for example, you and your spouse each have IRAs and 401(k)s, as well as taxable assets earmarked for retirement--think of them as a single entity rather than running each account as a well-diversified whole. Doing so gives you the freedom to pack a significant share of your assets into the best investments available to you within each account. Use Morningstar's Instant X-Ray tool to make sure the whole portfolio is diversified and that the asset allocation is in line with your target.

Day 17: See if you're on the right track for retirement savings Degree of difficulty: Moderate Most of the tasks in my 21-day investment fitness regimen have centered around helping you get your investment program up and running. But once you do, it's essential that you periodically check in to make sure that your portfolio and your savings rate put you on track to help you meet your goals.

One way to gauge whether your retirement plan is on track comes courtesy of Fidelity Investments. The firm recommends that investors in their 30s have retirement savings equal to their current salaries, those in their 40s have saved 3 times their current salaries, those in their 50s have saved 6 times, and those in their 60s have saved 8 times their current salaries.

For investors who are closing in on retirement and want to gauge their portfolio’s viability to supply their in-retirement income needs, they can simply multiply their current balances by 0.04. If that amount, plus any predictable income they’ll be able to rely on through Social Security and/or a pension, is sufficient to live on, they’re likely on the right track. (Retirement researchers have found that withdrawing 4% of a retirement portfolio’s balance in year 1 of retirement, then inflation-adjusting that dollar amount in subsequent years, gives a balanced portfolio a good shot of lasting for 25-30 years.)

Those are just rules of thumb, though. A financial advisor can provide a more precise read on the viability of your investment program, and can help you tweak it based on your own situation. Alternatively—or perhaps in addition to customized financial advice—you can turn to online tools to gauge the sufficiency of your retirement assets. T. Rowe Price's free Retirement Income Calculator is one of the most comprehensive. You'll be prompted to enter some information about yourself--your birth date, your expected retirement date, your current asset level and allocation, and your desired level of income in retirement. (You won't be asked to provide any personally identifying information, such as your name or Social Security number, though, so don't worry about anyone contacting you with a sales pitch.) The calculator will then give you a gauge of whether your portfolio in its current incarnation will support your desired level of income.

The bottom line with all of these tools is that they help you assess whether your portfolio can realistically support your goals. And the sooner you make that determination, the better positioned you will be to make changes so you don't fall short.

Day 18: Get a plan for your portfolio as you near retirement Degree of difficulty: Moderate Amassing enough assets to retire is the heaviest lifting that any of us will do in our investing lives. But even after you've cleared that hurdle, it's still important to have a plan for managing your assets during retirement.

Because encountering a bear market early in your retirement years can have a devastating impact on portfolios that are too aggressively positioned, it's a sensible idea to start moving a portion of your portfolio to safer securities like cash and bonds as retirement draws close.

Another key task for retirees and pre-retirees is to determine a realistic portfolio withdrawal rate. How much can you take out without running the risk of outliving your assets? There aren’t any one-size-fits-all answers, but many planning experts agree that a 4% initial withdrawal rate, combined with ongoing adjustments to account for inflation, is sustainable with a 60% equity/40% bond portfolio over a 25-year retirement period. However, retirees with longer time horizons and/or more conservative equity allocations should take more modest withdrawals. It’s also a good idea to adjust your withdrawal rate downward if you encounter a weak market; that way, more of your portfolio is in place to recover when stocks do.

Finally, if you've saved for retirement in various accounts--and most of us have--your retirement portfolio strategy must also include a plan for tapping those assets. As a general rule of thumb, you'll want to tap your taxable accounts first, deductible IRAs and company-retirement plan assets second, and Roth assets last. If you’re subject to required minimum distributions, fulfilling those distributions comes first.

Day 19: Use a ""bucketing"" system when constructing your in-retirement portfolio Degree of difficulty: Moderate to Difficult

One of the most daunting aspects of managing your finances is figuring out how to transition from accumulation mode into retirement, or ""harvest"" mode.

One intuitive way to construct a retirement portfolio is to create various buckets of money based on when you expect to tap them for living expenses. Bucket number one contains living expenses for the next 1 to 2 years, and therefore should consist of highly liquid investments like CDs and money market funds. This is money you can't afford to lose.

Bucket number two should be positioned for living expenses in years 3 through 10, and therefore you can afford to take on slightly more risk. Intermediate-term bond funds and even conservative stock funds or balanced fund are good choices for the intermediate sleeve of your retirement portfolio.

Those assets you don't expect to tap for at least 10 more years can be stashed in stocks and stock mutual funds. Because you've established you have a fairly long time horizon for this money, you won't be unduly upset if the stock market has periodic hiccups.

Day 20: Make sure your retirement portfolio includes inflation protection Degree of difficulty: Easy

If you're already retired or getting ready to do so, one of the key risks that you'll need to guard against is inflation. Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation (assuming the Consumer Price Index is going up), but the paychecks you'll take from your retirement portfolio will grow smaller and smaller--in real terms--as the prices on the stuff you buy trend up. It's therefore important to position your portfolio to address that threat.

Although investors often debate the best investments to guard against inflation, with some favoring so-called hard assets like commodities and gold, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) provide the most direct way to do so. The principal values of TIPS adjust upward to keep up with inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, giving investors a straightforward, low-cost way to ensure that their portfolios keep up with higher prices. I-Bonds, which can be purchased directly from the U.S. Treasury, have similar inflation-defending features. (In contrast with TIPS, however, I-Bonds receive an adjustment to their interest payments to account for inflation.)

Day 21: Schedule regular checkups Degree of difficulty: Moderate

Investors often make the mistake of checking up on their portfolios too frequently, or worse yet, only after big market moves, when they're most inclined to make rash decisions. To help avoid that pitfall, schedule regular checkups in advance. For most people, one comprehensive portfolio review per year is plenty, and much better than obsessing on a daily basis. Year-end--ideally around Thanksgiving, before the holidays gear up--is a good time to conduct your annual portfolio review, because you can still make adjustments to reduce your tax bill.

Morningstar.com's Portfolio Manager makes it easy to monitor your portfolio on an ongoing basis. You can either enter your portfolio directly into the tool or via our Instant X-Ray tool. After you've viewed the X-Ray for your portfolio, simply click Save Instant X-Ray as a Portfolio.

If you feel information overload setting in, fill in the Investment Policy Statement included here and also follow the steps in my ""quick and dirty"" portfolio checkup (Day 15).

Damien Conover: Johnson & Johnson reported fourth-quarter earnings that were largely in line with our expectations, and we came away with not making any change to our fair value. We continue to believe Johnson & Johnson is worth $130 per share and continues to have a wide economic moat.

I think there's three important takeaways from the results. First off, the results were in line with our expectations, again driven by strong drug sales. So these drug sales really offset some of the more slow growth that we see out of the consumer goods and the medical device product group.

The second key takeaway here is the guidance for 2019 was a little bit softer than we were anticipating on the top line but stronger with other income. What other income is, is largely divestitures that the company plans to make to help grow the earnings. The net impact of those two things largely doesn't change our fair value.

Then the last point that I'd make about the call that they hosted earlier today was that they talked about the talcum powder litigation concerns that have been really over the stock, really over the last couple months, and they continue to believe in the safety of this product. We continue to believe that this litigation overhang will not cause a significant impact to our fair value. We currently model in close to $2 billion in litigation concerns revolving around the litigation for the talcum powder, but again we don't anticipate that to have a material impact on our overall valuation.

The net take away from our perspective is, the fourth-quarter results were largely in line with our expectations; the 2019 outlook is a little softer than we thought, but it doesn't impact our fair value; and we continue to believe the stock is fairly valued.

Erin Lash: Over the last several years, much focus has resided within P&G's top-line trajectory, and the second-quarter results highlight that efforts to shed more than 100 brands from its mix and focus its investments behind its key brands are beginning to gain traction. More specifically, organic sales popped 4% in the quarter, similar to the gains reported in the prior quarter and on top of 2% growth in the year-ago period. Even more impressive is the fact that this growth was balanced and driven by both gains in price as well as volume.

Despite this improving performance that we anticipate will persist over the longer term, the firm is fairly valued at current levels after popping at a mid-single digit clip on the results. We would suggest that investors await a more attractive risk-reward opportunity before building a position in this wide-moat name.

Neil Macker: Netflix ended 2018 on a strong note as international subs beat guidance by a handily amount. The company continues to expand, both in the U.S. and internationally. But, the problem for the company is the cash burden continues with a free cash flow burn of $3 billion in 2018 and a similar level expected in 2019.

In our view, Netflix will face increasing competition over the next 18 months as NBC, Universal, Warner Media, and Disney all launch services. These services will all contain content from these large media firms, forcing Netflix to increase its content spend on original content. As a result of this increased content spend, we expect cash flow burn to remain at elevated levels over the next five years. This increased content spend will also limit margin expansion, both here in the U.S. and internationally.

As a result, we continue to believe that Netflix shares are overvalued. Our new fair value estimate is $135. We believe that investors should stay off the roller coaster that is Netflix for the foreseeable future.

***

Andrew Lange: Overall, our expectations leading into IBM's fourth quarter were anything but stellar. However, the company managed to surprise us with slightly better than expected revenue growth.

A couple of bright spots were apparent, with global business services, or GBS, outperforming sales expectations and the company's systems business managing to decline slower than we had forecast. We think the performance from GBS was particularly notable and supports our opinion that IBM as well as Accenture, remain the premier global IT services firms. We believe IBM's consulting and digital transformation skills are key assets for the firm, and we continue to see midterm growth tailwinds for this business after prior years of restructuring.

The firm provided an in-line outlook for fiscal 2019, and while it was a solid end to the year, our fair value estimate remains unchanged at $158 per share. Systems revenue was down significantly, but this was expected due to the highly cyclical nature of this business and the fact that the z14 mainframe is now at the tail end of its cycle.

Analytics and artificial intelligence software helped boost cognitive solutions, and as we look at the next year and beyond, we think IBM's recent $1.8 billion software sale to HCL will help to lessen IBM's legacy exposure and reinvigorate the subsequent growth profile of the cognitive solutions business.

Technology services and cloud platforms remain mixed, and we think this will be the case for at least the near term, with IBM looking to exit lower value infrastructure work.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com. Despite their best intentions, retirees sometimes miss their required minimum distributions. Joining me to share some steps to take in this situation is Ed Slott, he is a retirement expert.

Ed, thank you so much for being here.

Ed Slott: Great to be back here. Thanks.

Benz: Ed, let's discuss required minimum distributions briefly--which accounts are subject to them and who is subject to them.

Slott: This is great to start off the year knowing all of your accounts that are subject to RMDs, because we find at tax time that's when we hear, oh, I missed, I forgot that account, I forgot this account, I took the wrong amount. This is when we see all the errors. In general, IRAs after 70 1/2 are subject to required minimum distribution. So are 401(k)s if you are not still working. If you are still working, there are exceptions for some people. So, or any other plan, except Roth IRAs; Roth IRAs, that's sort of a big advantage--they are not subject to lifetime RMDs. But your 403(b)s, 457, your 401(k)s and your IRAs are subject to RMDs. Especially, when people start, that's when the confusion sets in, but every year in the beginning of the year that's when we hear, oh, I missed it.

Benz: Right. So, let's discuss what happens if you miss it, because it's not something you want to mess around with. There is a big penalty, right?

Slott: Yeah, it's a 50--and I always say, 5-0 because it sounds like 15, because 50 doesn't sound believable--50, 50% penalty on the amount you should have taken but didn't or any shortfall, let's say. But that penalty can be waived if you do take the right steps.

Benz: We're going to talk about those steps. Say, it's the new year and I realized I didn't take my distribution for last year, what process should I go through, first of all, to let the authorities know and also try to make a case about why I missed it? Actually, there is some leniency ... so let's talk about that.

Slott: The first thing you have to know, people always ask, should I go back last year and take it? Only if you have a time machine. You can't go back to a year and take, and say, I took it that year. So, you can't go back. It has nothing to do with the prior year. And some people say, but don't I have unreported income? No. Unreported income is income you took, but didn't report; you never took this income.

There is no effect on the prior year other than you have a potential 50% penalty. You have to make it up. Currently, as soon as you discover it, you should figure out the amount you were short or whatever the RMD that was missed, and take the makeup distribution immediately. Then, of course, take you regular distribution for the year so you stay on track. And then you report that on what's called Form 5329. It's a tax form where you report the 50% penalty. You tell IRS this was my required amount, this is how much I didn't take, how much I was short, but you don't pay the penalty. Years ago you had to pay and then ask for an abatement …

Benz: Ask for it back. You just show zero, but you must attach a statement saying two thing: number one, that I made up the shortfall, you have to show good faith that whatever I missed, I took immediately upon discovery. Then give a short explanation of why, and IRS waives the penalty in almost every case. They know they are talking about seniors, people over 70 1/2, they got confused, they had a medical issue, a death in the family, bad information from a bank or financial advisor. You just put whatever reason it was and take the missed--well you have already taken the missed distribution--and file that form with your regular tax return.

Benz: There is some leniency, would you say, in terms of getting these penalties waived?

Slott: Oh, yeah. Almost everybody gets the penalties waived. I can't even think of somebody I have ever seen declined. I have seen one case, and it was an oddball case because they didn't understand the rules and they actually asked IRS if they would assess the penalty. It's a long story, but don't ever do that.

Benz: In terms of the paper trail that I want to maintain to try to keep my taxes clear and straight, what should I do in terms of--I'm addressing this missed RMD, but then I also have another RMD coming due for this year ahead. How do I handle that?

Slott: There is no requirement. But what I do on a practical level, I tell people take separate distributions. Take the makeup distribution separately, so it can be better traced if it's ever a question--there is that one. You could mix it in with your current one, but then somebody would have to figure out, well, did they just take too much of the current one and not the other one. Separate them. Take the missed distribution separately and the current one separately so they can be traced.

Benz: Then in terms of avoiding this problem altogether, do you have any tips on that front of things that people who are subject to RMDs can do to avoid falling into this trap?

Slott: First thing, in the beginning of the year, take an inventory of every retirement account you have subject to required minimum distributions. It might be a first year, so you just turned 70 1/2 and you didn't know, or maybe you have that old 401(k) or a 403(b)--you should have an inventory of all the RMDs. That includes if you are a beneficiary. Remember this 50% penalty also applies to beneficiaries. So if you just inherited, you have a required minimum distribution probably starting in the year after you inherited. You should know all the accounts that are subject to RMDs.

But before you take them, going back to something we've talked about on other programs, if you're going to do the qualified charitable distribution, which applies to IRA owners over 70 1/2, do that at the beginning of the year so it can offset the income from your required minimum distribution, because the first dollars out are deemed to satisfy your required minimum distribution.

Benz: Ed, useful discussion. I know this problem crops up for some retirees. Thank you so much for being here.

Slott: Thanks, Christine.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com.

Aron Szaprio: As the shutdown stretches into its fourth week, I've been getting a lot of questions about whether anything has changed. I wrote a column earlier in the shutdown explaining that we've got a lot of experience with these, and longer ones of course slightly ding the economy. But the big story is that shutdowns are really a lagging indicator of governmental dysfunction and a leading indicator that it will be hard for Congress to accomplish much going forward.

Shutdowns have been a regular feature of American government ever since Congress set up the modern appropriations process way back in 1974. If I can paraphrase ""Casablanca"": This is just like any other shutdown, only moreso.

The window for this Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that could help ordinary investors was always going to be pretty limited, given the realities of divided government. These efforts might have included cleaning up the tax bill to fix technical errors, making it easier for 401(k) savers to access guaranteed income, or adjusting required minimum distributions—to name a few things Congress is pursuing. Obviously, this shutdown makes doing any of those things more difficult.

This shutdown also raises some questions about Congress' ability to deal with something even more important for ordinary investors and potentially the entire U.S. economy: the debt ceiling. The media often conflates shutdowns and the debt ceiling, but they are very different, and I want to explain that. The shutdown simply means Congress has not appropriated funds to keep federal agencies running. In contrast, failing to raise the debit limit could lead to a financial catastrophe--that's not my analysis, that's the official line form the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Government Accountability Office, and basically every other expert who has looked at the U.S. defaulting on its obligations.

So coming back to the shutdown and investing, after March 1, the government will need to take ""extraordinary measures"" to avoid defaulting, and those measures will last for a few months. Ordinary investors should be aware that in 2013, the last time it looked as though Congress might not raise the limit, the market avoided Treasury securities that matured around the dates when the government projected it would exhaust the extraordinary measures.

So, looking ahead, ordinary investors shouldn't be surprised if we see an increase in rates and a decline in liquidity if it looks like the debt ceiling fight is going to be dramatic again. The current state of the shutdown may presage such drama.

In terms of when this might end, no one knows for sure. But there is an unusual dynamic that is not that encouraging. Previous shutdowns have been due to Congress adding riders to appropriations bills the president deemed unacceptable. The president then has an incentive to make the shutdown hard for ordinary Americans, to push for an end to the impasse. This shutdown is reversed: The president wants the policy riders, and he has an incentive to make the shutdown as painless as possible by taking a broad view of what government can do. For example the president has tried to keep parks open and has said he will try to send tax refunds during a shutdown. That may mean things go on for longer than they otherwise would have.

For Morningstar, I'm Aron Szapiro.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com. The turning of the calendar page provides an opportunity to reassess your portfolio. Joining me to discuss a few investment themes that could be worthy of further research is Russ Kinnel. He is director of manager research for Morningstar.

Russ, thank you so much for being here.

Russ Kinnel: Glad to be here.

Benz: Russ, in the most recent issue of Morningstar FundInvestor you looked at some investment ideas, some themes to investigate in 2019. But before we get into that, let's just talk about 2018. It was not a great year for stock or bond investors, right?

Kinnel: That's right. Just about everything was in the red. Bonds were about flat, but equities lost between 5% and 20% depending on what area you were invested in. Definitely, a really volatile year and certainly could have really altered your portfolio mix.

Benz: You do think that as investors are sort of looking at their portfolios, surveying the damage, it's time to take a look at that baseline asset allocation, see where you stand relative to your goals, relative to your spending horizon.

Kinnel: Exactly. I think the main thing you want to think about is making sure you are still on your plan and making whatever changes are needed to get back on that plan. Because obviously when you have some big moves, that can change your portfolio mix.

Benz: One area that you highlighted in the most recent issue of FundInvestor was the small-value space. It's an area where even if investors haven't been actively pulling away from it, their positions there have probably shrunk. Let's talk about what's going on with that category.

Kinnel: Small-value is an area that just keeps underperforming for a number of years, and usually that's a trend that reverses very nicely and you then have a multiyear rally in small-value or at least outperformance. There's certainly a lot of potential positives and you can see some reasons why if you think about large-growth doing well, well some of the FAANGs are eating some of those small-value companies' lunch. It's tough to compete with the Googles and Amazons of the world, but not all of small-value companies are in their target area and some of that sell-off may be overdone.

Benz: You highlighted a few funds that you like in this space, and I'd like to talk about a couple of them. One of them, I think, will probably be familiar to people who have watched you talk about the small-value space, Royce Special Equity. Let's talk about what you like about it. It's Silver-rated, very long-tenured, senior manager on the fund. Let's talk about what's to like about it.

Kinnel: I really like Charlie Dreifus and his approach that really focuses on accounting and quality balance sheets. It's a strategy that leads them into good, relatively safe names, and in downturns it really stands out nicely. If you look at the long-term record of Dreifus, he has got a very strong record, and a lot of that is built in losing less in downturns because of that emphasis on accounting. I think it's a little different from anything you see anywhere else. And again, when I look for a fund, I want a competitive advantage and I think this fund has a genuine competitive advantage.

Benz: It has a comanager now. So, Charlie Dreifus is not flying this fund solo. He has been on the fund for a number of years, but he has a comanager.

Kinnel: That's right. No retirement date has been announced for Charlie, but obviously the successor is there, someone who really buys into Dreifus' way of investing. We feel pretty good about where the fund is going.

Benz: Another small-value fund you like, also Silver-rated, might be a little bit less familiar, LSV Small Cap Value. Let's talk about that one.

Kinnel: Right. Fairly different fund. This is a quantitative fund. LSV is a shop that has an academic grounding, lots of Ph.D.s and quants running their funds. It's a quantitative fund looking for good value names, good companies that are slightly beaten down. If you look at their long-term record, they have done a very good job across the board at their funds, and we just like that academic grounding and the fact that they are always willing to update their models but at the same time they don't drastically overhaul. It doesn't feel like the momentum version of a quant fund. We think that they are really well-designed funds.

Benz: Another theme that you hit on--and this might seem a little perhaps counterintuitive because investors are really moving away from active managers in general and to the extent that they have active managers, they tend to want the very seasoned ones--but you actually say that rising-star managers are people to take a look at or funds to take a look at. Why is that?

Kinnel: Well, I think, if you find a manager who has got some experience but not, say, 30 years, you've got someone who may have a very long runway. They may have a lot of years ahead of them of doing well, and yet, many of these funds are ones that are not that big. You really kind of have potentially a sweet spot of a manager who is really hitting their stride but is not overwhelmed with assets. That's really the ideal, to get to these funds a little ahead of the curve. I think it's worth paying attention to funds. Not that I would avoid the seasoned managers. Obviously, I like Charlie Dreifus, who's got a very long track record. But I think some of these managers are worth investigating, putting on your watchlist.

Benz: You did compile a more detailed watchlist in FundInvestor, but let's talk about a couple of ones that you especially like. One is Vincent Montemaggiore at Fidelity Overseas. Let's talk about that one.

Kinnel: He is a very interesting investor at Fidelity. He has kind of got a Buffett influence and you see that emphasis on high-quality moats, a little willingness to pay up. He fits in the foreign large growth, though there's a lot of large blend names in the portfolio, too. But just a very thoughtful investor who really thinks long term and has built a good record yet hasn't gotten overwhelmed with assets yet. We raised that to Silver not too long ago, and we really have a high opinion of Montemaggiore.

Benz: How are you feeling about managerial stability at Fidelity funds these days? Have they stabilized, would you say? Or what's your view?

Kinnel: Much more so. So, say, versus 10 years ago, where you had musical chairs, but also a lot of people leaving the firm, we really haven't seen that in recent years. It's been much more stability and better handling of manager transitions. We feel a lot better about them. I wouldn't yet put them maybe at the top of the list of stability, but they have improved a lot.

Benz: Another fund you like also, a foreign stock fund, this is T. Rowe Price International Concentrated Equity run by Federico Santilli. Let's talk about that one.

Kinnel: This is a fund that's got about a four-year record on the retail version, about an eight-year record on the institutional. So, we got a little more to go on than you'd see on the retail version. But he has built a really good record with a concentrated strategy. Of course, because it's T. Rowe, it's only kind of concentrated.

Benz: Well, that's what I was going to ask. I don't usually think of them as a concentrated fund shop.

Kinnel: Right. This is not like a Bill Nygren or Sequoia. They have got 60 names, but the top holding isn't even 3%. So, it's not that bold. You are not living or dying on a couple of stocks. But again, a good strategy. Kind of like Montemaggiore's in that they are looking for good companies with competitive advantages trading at a reasonable price, but a little more of value tilt. This fund is in the blend category. It's got a big emphasis on Europe, in particular. You see overweights to German and Swiss companies. A pretty distinctive strategy from T. Rowe Price. But again, I think this is one that's still under people's radar.

Benz: Russ, some interesting themes and some interesting funds. Thank you so much for being here.

Kinnel: You're welcome.

Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com.

Susan Dziubinski: Small-cap stocks have plenty going for them. They can add diversification to a portfolio and offer greater potential return than large-cap stocks albeit with some additional risk. Here to discuss the three highest-rated small-cap ETFs that Morningstar analysts cover is Adam McCullough. He is an analyst in our manager research group focusing on passive strategies.

Adam, thank you for joining us today.

Adam McCullough: Happy to be here today, Susan.

Dziubinski: Now, all three of the funds that we are going to talk about today track well-constructed investable indexes, and they are inexpensive to boot. The three funds do have some differences. The first one is Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF.

McCullough: You are right, Susan. Each of these funds do something a little bit different to dampen the impact of trading costs among the small-cap indexes. The first fund is Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF. What this fund does, it tracks one of the Dow Jones small-cap indexes, and it uses buffering rules so that it doesn't trade stocks unnecessarily on its reconstitution dates. If a stock graduates to the mid-cap level, it won't trade it into the mid-cap, then out of the mid-cap, then into the mid-cap if it's on the edge. It will wait until it's fully in that mid-cap range before trading.

You get the exposure that you want in small-cap stocks without unnecessarily trading names as they go between different buckets. And so, this fund also charges 5 basis points per year, so it's cheap. Over the past three years through December 2018, it's actually outpaced its benchmark by 2 basis points per year. That kind of shows, one, that it's mitigating the impact of transaction costs, and two, might have some help with securities-lending income that offsets some of the fees that it charges.

Dziubinski: Another one of our Gold-rated ETFs is Vanguard Small-Cap ETF. How is this one a little bit different?

McCullough: The Vanguard fund is a little bit different in that it tracks the CRSP Small Cap Index. So, again, it's looking for small-cap stocks. But the CRSP indexes were built to be investable. Maybe the first generation of indexes were more benchmarks, you know, how is your fund performing. The CRSP suite of indexes is made for investment. What this fund does beyond buffering rules is it actually will spread out trading over five days. So, when the mix changes, instead of trading all the stocks on one day-so buying a bunch of names, selling a bunch of names--it trades that over five days in a week. That will break the impact of the trades by one-fifth because it's trading one over five days.

And the second thing that it does is it uses a technique called packeting. What this means is, when a stock graduates to the mid-cap bucket, instead of moving everything at once, once it does get fully into that bucket, it will move half of the position. It will move half the position, wait till the next reconstitution; if the stock is still squarely in the mid-cap range, it will move the other half. So, that also breaks the trading in half and so it lowers the market impact cost as well. This fund is rated Gold as you mentioned. It charges 5 basis points per year. Over the past three years through December 2018, it's also topped its benchmark by 2 basis points.

Dziubinski: And our last Gold-rated small-cap ETF is iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF. And this one has a market cap that seems to fall somewhere between the other two funds that we've talked about so far.

McCullough: That's right. The iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF does fall between those other two funds based on its average market cap. But this fund also uses a little different of a technique to avoid forecasting its trades in the market. While the first two funds follow strict reconstitution schedules, the S&P Small Cap 600 Index is actually run by a committee. It doesn't have a prescheduled reconstitution day and the committee members can actually decide when to add or remove names from the index. You can't forecast out, this is the June reconstitution; it looks like these stocks might graduate to the mid-cap index and will be sold out of this index. They can say, you know what, now it's time to reconstitute, we're going to go ahead and do that. And so, by not forecasting the trades, it lowers the transaction costs for funds such as this fund that track the index.

And this fund is also cheap. It charges 7 basis points per year. It's actually not outpaced its index, unlike the other two funds. It's lagged by 1 basis point over three years, but still very small.

Dziubinski: These all sound like great options for investors. Adam, thank you for your insights today.

McCullough: Absolutely.

Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski for Morningstar.com. Thank you for watching.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com. How can investors build a solid foundation for their portfolios? Joining me via Skype to discuss that topic is Alex Bryan, he's director of passive research strategies for Morningstar in North America.

Alex, thank you so much for being here.

Alex Bryan: Thank you for having me.

Benz: You dedicated the most recent issue of Morningstar ETFInvestor to the topic of building a strong foundation for investor's portfolios, and you emphasized the importance of asset allocation--deciding what is an appropriate stock, bond, cash mix for you given your life stage. You say that investors spend a lot more time on security selection but ultimately asset allocation is more impactful. How do you know that? What does the research say about that topic?

Bryan: That's a great question. Imagine you had a portfolio that was allocated 40% to U.S. stocks, 20% to international stocks, and 40% to bonds. If you had perfect foresight and could somehow identify the managers that would have gone on to land in the top 5% of their respective Morningstar categories in each of those areas, you would have had a return of about 7.6% over the last 15 years through November. Now if you had instead decided to build that allocation with broad market-cap-weighted indexes your return would have been about 6.8%. So achieving that type of success with manager selection is very difficult, and as you can see from that example the return benefit is relatively modest.

But if I had instead decided to shift the asset allocation from 60% in stocks to 90% in stocks, the return on the portfolio would have climbed from 6.8% to 8%. So shifting the asset allocation has a much bigger impact on your overall portfolio's risk and its returns. That makes sense because stocks and bonds performed quite differently, so how much you decide to allocate to each bucket's going to have a much bigger impact on your overall performance than manager selection within each of those categories.

Benz: I know that's it's one thing that investors really struggle with--this idea of finding an appropriate asset allocation. I hear from a lot of investors that it seems quite black boxy to them. Do you have any thoughts on what factors investors should home in on, when they are trying to think about setting their asset allocation what should they prioritize?

Bryan: I think while we talk about a lot about returns, and that certainly draws our attention, I think more than anything else it's really important to allow your ability and willingness to take risk really dictate what type of asset allocation you have. It's important not to take more risk than you are comfortable with because if you do that you might experience losses that you are not prepared to handle. It can make it more difficult to stay invested through the markets rough patches, which will inevitably happen over time.

Benz: How do investors take their own personal situations and customize that to arrive at some sort of an appropriate asset allocation plan?

Bryan: One of the first things you should do to figure out how much risk you should take is identify the time period for which you have your investment. If I don't need the money for a long period of time, I can afford to take greater risk with my money, because the risk of losing money actually goes down the longer your investment horizon is. Stocks have a better shot of earning a positive return the longer that you hold them. If I have a really big objective that I need to meet--let's say I am making down payment on a house in the next year or so--I probably shouldn't allocate a lot of my money to stocks, but there's a good shot I could lose money over a short window of time. The longer your investment horizon the more risk you can take. So it's important to keep that in mind.

It's also important to understand your own willingness to take risk. If you are not comfortable with the prospect of losing money, it's probably not a good idea to allocate a big part of your portfolio to stocks. You need to have a balanced allocation that lets you sleep at night and something that you can stick with over the long term.

Benz: Assuming someone has taken those steps and identified an appropriate asset allocation mix, the next step is to populate that portfolio with some good core building blocks. Are there any categories that you would suggest investors focus on, any investment types that you would suggest that they tend to favor at the expense of others?

Bryan: The most important thing to keep in mind for identifying core investments--these are funds that should be broadly diversified, that should be very low cost, and they should be holdings that you can stick with regardless of what's happening in the market. The types of Morningstar categories that you might look for a core holding in would be the Morningstar large-blend category. This is typically going to be your broadest bucket of stocks; it includes large-cap stocks across the value-growth-style spectrum. You'd also want to look for your exposure to international stocks within the Morningstar foreign large-blend category. Then as far as bonds go it's good to look within the intermediate-term bond category which focuses on U.S. investment grade bonds.

Typically within each of those categories I would want to look for funds that are broadly diversified and funds that are among the lowest cost options within each of those categories. Because over time these are one of the best predicators of fund performance--the less you pay the better your odds are of achieving better returns.

Benz: What you've just talked about, I think, naturally would lead investors to favor perhaps some core-type passively managed funds. Can you talk about some of your favorite funds within each of those categories?

Bryan: As you mentioned these broad index funds are a good starting point; certainly not the only type of fund that would be suitable as its core holding. But I think if you are looking for a good place to start, one of the better options is the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, the ticker is VTI. This fund basically owns all U.S. stocks, and then it weights them based on their relative market capitalization. Effectively what this is doing is it's owning the market portfolio, harnessing all investors' collective wisdom, and it's delivering that exposure at a very, very low fee. That low fee allows investors to keep more of their money. This one has a good shot of outperforming relative to its actively managed peers because it charges considerably less. It's also a very tax-efficient option, low turnover, it hasn't made any capital gains distributions over its life. I think this is a really good core option for exposure to U.S. stocks.

If you are looking for exposure to international stocks, the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF, ticker VXUS, is a really great option. It again owns most stocks listed outside the U.S., both foreign developed and emerging-markets stocks and then weights them according to their market capitalization. This is also a very low cost fund that has been very tax efficient. I think it's a good complement to that U.S. stock fund.

Then as for fixed-income exposure, Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF, ticker BND, is a really good option. This fund basically provides broad exposure to the U.S. investment-grade bond market. So it owns Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and it weights each of those bonds according to its market value. It does tend to tilt pretty heavily toward pretty conservative U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. But that actually makes this a pretty good complement to stocks because those more highly rated conservative bonds tend to provide good downside protection. So in periods when the stock market is selling off this can provide a nice counterbalance to stocks and serve as the defense within your portfolio.

I think between these three funds--the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund for U.S. stocks; Vanguard Total International Fund; and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF--I think these can help you build a really solid core portfolio that you could stick with through thick and thin.

Benz: Great recommendations, Alex. Thank you so much for being here.

Bryan: Thank you for having me.

Benz: Thanks for watching I'm Christine Benz from Morningstar.com.
