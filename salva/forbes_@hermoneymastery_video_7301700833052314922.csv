The narrative around bitcoin, once dominated by speculation and controversy, is gradually evolving. There is a growing interest in exploring its potential to positively impact the U.S. economy, championed by several pro-crypto politicians. Most recently, this perspective has also been actively promoted by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, prompting broader public debate.

This momentum offers a good opportunity to assess whether this idea holds real economic merit. A closer examination reveals that bitcoin holds potential to reduce the U.S. national debt, diversify the country’s reserves, and help its oil industry.

Bitcoin Bitcoin +3.8% Could Help Reduce National Debt

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced an ambitious proposal to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve. Her bill, which she described as “our Louisiana Purchase moment,” outlines a plan to acquire 1 million BTC over five years. The senator also claimed that such a reserve would “serve as an additional store of value to bolster America’s balance sheet.”

The U.S. balance sheet is indeed in dire need of bolstering. With the national debt now towering at $35 trillion, the country is spending $0.95 trillion annually just to service it. Compounding the problem is the declining dominance of the dollar, which exacerbates the situation by reducing demand for Treasury securities – leaving the government with fewer resources to borrow and refinance the debt.

The recent European Central Bank report highlights this trend. While the euro’s share of global foreign exchange reserves has remained steady at around 20% over the past two decades, the US dollar’s share has dropped from over 70% to below 59%. Meanwhile, the share of “other currencies” has surged from 9% to almost 22%.

Rising debt and shrinking borrowing capacity form a troubling trend, and one of these trajectories must be reversed. Reducing debt seems like the more feasible option, as the dollar’s decline is driven by factors beyond economics, notably the U.S. weaponizing the dollar, which has prompted many countries to reduce their over-reliance on it.

Reducing national debt traditionally involves unpopular political decisions, such as raising taxes and cutting social spending, making it seem particularly difficult in the current political climate. So, desperate times call for desperate – or creative – measures, and bitcoin might just be the answer.

Bitcoin appeals to people for the same reasons the dollar does not: free from the influence of any single nation's politics, it is provably scarce and enables borderless and relatively cheap transactions (especially with its layer-2 Lightning Network). Furthermore, with a market cap of just $1 trillion, bitcoin price has room for growth – a potential that could be realized rather quickly if the world’s largest economic power were to embrace it. By creating a strategic BTC reserve, the U.S. could trigger a bandwagon effect, potentially driving up the coin’s price and enabling the Treasury to pay down part of the national debt through capital gains.

The Impact Of A Bitcoin National Reserve

Diversification is key to financial resilience, whether in personal portfolios or national reserves. From this perspective, bitcoin stands out as a unique asset class that operates independently of traditional financial systems.

As shown by The Block, bitcoin’s correlation with stock indexes and gold fluctuates between 0.9 (highly correlated) and -0.9 (negatively correlated). This variability underscores its diversification potential, which the U.S. foreign reserves could strategically leverage.

Indeed, the U.S. foreign reserves are rather unvaried and modest given the scale of the American economy. Composed primarily of gold, special drawing rights with the IMF, and foreign currencies like the euro and yen, the U.S. official reserve assets now stand at only $246 billion ($908 billion if gold were recalculated at the current market price).

Enter bitcoin. By diversifying the foreign reserves, the leading cryptocurrency could help better manage external economic shocks that might threaten the dollar's stability, such as fluctuations in other reserve assets. A stronger, more diversified reserve would also enhance confidence in the dollar.

Additionally, a more robust foreign reserve would be invaluable in times of crisis. Black swan events often come without warning, and it’s generally wiser to put your eggs in different baskets to ensure you have some for tomorrow.

Sustainable Bitcoin Mining To Boost Oil Industry

The U.S. is probably the country where embracing bitcoin at a national level could produce the most significant catalytic impact. After China’s mining ban in 2021, America became a major hub for bitcoin mining, producing almost 38% of the total hashrate, according to the latest available data from CBECI (2022). Additionally, 13 out of the world’s 24 largest mining companies are registered in the U.S., as per CompaniesMarketCap.

Bitcoin mining involves using specialized rigs to secure the blockchain with large amounts of electricity in exchange for newly created BTC and transaction fees. Since miners are location-agnostic, they can be set up virtually anywhere with abundant and inexpensive energy. This flexibility drives innovation, and one of the most promising avenues for bitcoin mining in the U.S. today is capturing flared gas, a by-product of oil extraction. American oil producers like ExxonMobile and ConocoPhillips are already partnering with bitcoin mining companies that install their rigs in North Dakota oil fields. The higher bitcoin’s price climbs, the more profitable such operations become, while also reducing harmful emissions, boosting economic activity, and creating an additional wealth source for the country.

The Risks Of Adopting Bitcoin

For a seasoned bitcoiner who has maintained confidence in the asset through market’s ups and downs, the economic benefits of bitcoin may seem obvious. However, most people would question whether is it wise – or safe – for a country to gamble with its reserves?

These concerns are not without merit, and it’s crucial to map the risks before taking any important decision. Indeed, for the above scenario to hold, bitcoin must fulfill its initial promises. The blockchain must function as intended and real adoption must grow to ensure that U.S. market intervention does not simply inflate the coin’s price. Furthermore, the officials must consider issues like volatility, liquidity, and security very seriously.

While the risks are real, the potential rewards of adopting bitcoin on a national level could be transformative for the economy. Some countries, like El Salvador or Bhutan, have already recognized this.

Bitcoin In El Salvador And Bhutan

El Salvador is famous for becoming the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, integrating it into several national projects aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing debt. However, shortly after the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, the IMF warned the country of the risks on “financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection”, urging it to remove the legal tender status. El Salvador refused.

Three years in, El Salvador holds 5,875 BTC, now worth 34.5% more than the average purchase price. The country has also begun mining Bitcoin using geothermal energy from its volcanoes and has seen its bonds outperform the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCYInvesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF 0.0%) in 2023, benefiting from the momentum around Bitcoin spot ETFs. Even the IMF now cannot help but concede that “on bitcoin, many of the risks have not yet materialized”.

Overall, despite the grassroot bitcoin adoption remaining low at 12%, President Nayib Bukele views the project as a success. “It gave us branding, it brought us investments, it brought us tourism,” he said in a recent interview for Time Magazine.

With far less fanfare, the Asian nation of Bhutan has been quietly mining bitcoin since 2019. Arkham Intelligence’s recent research reveals that the country now holds 13,036 BTC - an impressive amount equivalent to over a quarter of its GDP. For one of the world's most isolated countries, bitcoin could be the way to bolster its financial independence, while its abundant hydroelectric resources provide a sustainable way to do so.

The U.S. has different economic goals from El Salvador or Bhutan, but investing in bitcoin aligns with them too. Moreover, given its immense economic power, even a relatively small investment could have an outsized return. While Bhutan holds 27% of its GDP in bitcoin and El Salvador 1%, Senator Warren’s proposed purchase of 1 million BTC would represent just 0.2% of the U.S. GDP (at current prices). Yet, such a move by the world's largest economy could potentially send bitcoin’s price “to the moon” and help address some of the country's serious economic challenges."

“In today’s world of work, competitive pay is table stakes — it’s the bare minimum,” says Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., the president and CEO of SHRM, the Society for Human Resource Management. “Employees expect more, with holistic benefits packages becoming an increasingly critical part of what sets organizations apart in the fight to attract and retain talent.”

Taylor noted: “According to SHRM’s 2024 Employee Benefits Survey, health care, leave, and retirement savings and planning rank the highest in employer importance regarding benefits. But right below those three is a second tier of high-priority benefits: flexible work, family care, and professional and career development, which points toward employers’ desire to meet employee wants and needs in a tight labor market where many workers continue to value flexibility and professional development.”

Your Benefits — and Employee Perception — Are Part of Your Brand

Just as brands invest in consumer-facing brand-building, they realize they must also have strong employment/retention brands. Whether competing for the best talent or giving high-performers more reasons to build careers, they are starting to look more closely at how they are perceived as employers — especially as the workforce becomes more diverse.

But What About Education?

Student loan debt has surpassed credit card debt and is now a whopping $1.75T. Who can even start thinking about what they’ll do when they’re 65 when those monthly payments loom?

Although all generations may be interested in “getting smarter” on their employer’s dime (or millions of dimes), younger team members are understandably more interested in digging themselves out of short-term debt than worrying about buying that home — like they might have been thirty years ago. Savvy companies must continue to research to understand what’s of the most significant value to the people they want to hire and retain.

How Do Companies Know What Their Employees Want?

Forrester Principal Analyst Betsy Summers says, “According to recent data from a joint survey to HR leaders from Forrester and HR Executive, an annual survey is the most commonly relied-on research method for understanding retention and engagement drivers.

Still, only 60% of organizations report doing surveys. More in-depth research, like journey mapping, monthly pulse surveys, and sentiment analysis, sits at 25% and 16%, respectively. Though every company might say they want to understand what attracts and retains their workforce, only those who invest in the right listening strategies and then act on the results are serious about it.”

Strong understanding of workforce needs led to introducing student loan-related benefits at the University of Miami, UHealth and the Miller School of Medicine. “Our approach is driven by a deep commitment to listening to our faculty and staff to offer benefits that can make a difference in their lives”, says Alison Mincey, their SVP and CHRO. “Recognizing the impact of student loan debt on our workforce, we established a student loan repayment assistance program that provides monthly contributions to repay student loans, resources to achieve loan forgiveness, and loan coaches for additional support. Thousands are already benefiting from this program.”

In addition, AI and other workplace transformations mean that employees need to continuously “upskill” or “reskill” to progress at their current company or move on to something bigger and better, increasing the cost of education.

“Student loan debt-related benefits have been solving critical staffing and turnover issues for employers in healthcare and education for a long time,” says Scott Thompson, CEO of Tuition.io. Scott continued, “We’re now seeing this strategy emerge in other industries looking to appeal to the next generation of workers, as Healthcare and 401(k) benefits just aren’t as relevant for younger, healthier employees with high living expenses.” While most employers are still on the sidelines some forward-looking and responsive companies stand out as setting the next standard of benefits for the future workforce.

Verizon is one of those companies. Earlier this year Verizon implemented its Secure Your Future program. Starting on day one of employment, employees can get up to a 6% company matching 401(k) contribution by making qualified student loan payments. “When the Secure 2.0 Act was passed, we saw it as an opportunity to offer another way for our employees to earn a matching contribution to our retirement plan,” stated Kevin Cammarata, Vice President of Benefits at Verizon. He continued, “We aimed to bridge the gap between employees’ immediate financial needs and long-term goals, which can be a differentiator with those that are wrestling with student loan debt.” Verizon reports over 1,800 employees have enrolled in the benefit since the program launched.

Technology also now plays a more significant role in benefits selection and administration for digitally savvy employers and employees. Self-service benefits management has become necessary for forward thinking companies, especially those trying to attract employees of all ages and stages.

Thompson summarized “Gen Z has been hit hardest by student loan debt, and employers must find solutions that ease the pain. By supporting individual financial wellness and career growth, companies can both stand out to this population and solve the damaging impact of turnover on organizational performance.”"

GETTY

The ability to operate efficiently and adapt quickly to changing market conditions can make the difference between a startup's success and failure. While innovative ideas and a passionate team are essential, the strategic use of technology can significantly boost a startup's effectiveness and optimization.

When I founded my startup, I used a range of technological tools to streamline operations and enhance productivity. For instance, adopting cloud computing services allowed us to scale our infrastructure seamlessly as our needs grew, and project management tools kept our team aligned and focused. These tools were instrumental in navigating the early challenges of running a business with limited resources and tight deadlines.

Based on this experience, here's a guide to some of the types of technology startups can consider to help streamline operations, support productivity, drive growth, enhance the customer experience and manage costs.

1. Streamlining Operations

Operational efficiency is crucial for startups, which often operate with limited resources and tight budgets. As such, founders can explore technologies that help streamline workflows and reduce unnecessary costs. For instance:

Cloud computing: Cloud services can help startups scale their infrastructure based on demand. This flexibility eliminates the need for costly physical servers and provides easy access to data and applications from anywhere.

Project management tools: Startups might also find it helpful to adopt tools that help teams manage projects more effectively. Using a platform for task tracking, communication and resource allocation can enhance transparency and ensure employees are aligned and focused on their tasks.

Customer relationship management systems: CRM systems help startups manage their interactions with customers more efficiently by tracking customer interactions and providing valuable insights into customer behavior.

2. Supporting Productivity

Implementing technology that automates repetitive tasks and facilitates better time management can lead to significant gains in efficiency. Examples include:

Automation tools: Automation can reduce the time spent on routine activities and allow team members to focus on more strategic initiatives. When starting my business, automating our email marketing campaigns and invoicing processes was particularly helpful. This automation saved valuable time and reduced manual errors.

Collaboration software: A number of platforms provide communication and collaboration features that help remote and in-office teams work together. Tools that support real-time messaging, video conferencing and file sharing can make it easier to coordinate efforts and complete projects on time.

Time management apps: Time-tracking software helps teams track their time and identify areas where efficiency can be improved. This can enable better workload management and set realistic deadlines.

3. Driving Growth

For startups, growth is not just an objective; it's a necessity. Attracting more customers, increasing revenue and expanding market presence are essential for long-term success. Some tools that may help with this include:

Digital marketing tools: Marketing platforms that offer advanced targeting options and analytics can help businesses reach their target audiences more effectively.

E-commerce solutions: Startups in the e-commerce space can explore platforms that handle payment processing, inventory management and order tracking, so the business can focus on growing their customer base and increasing sales.

Data analytics: By analyzing customer behavior, market trends and business performance, startups can identify growth opportunities and optimize their strategies accordingly.

4. Enhancing The Customer Experience

A positive customer experience is vital for building loyalty and gaining a competitive edge. Some technology can enhance how startups interact with and serve their customers. For example:

Chatbots: AI-powered chatbots can provide support to customers by answering queries and resolving issues in real time. Consider integrating chatbots into websites and apps to ensure customers receive service around the clock.

Personalization tools: Technology can also be used to analyze customer data and recommend relevant products, content and offers. This can enhance the overall customer experience and increase the likelihood of repeat business.

Customer feedback systems: Research platforms that can help gather feedback from customers. Understanding customer needs and preferences can help startups make informed decisions about product development and service improvements.

5. Managing Costs

Cost management is vital for startups, which often have limited budgets. Technology can help reduce expenses in various ways.

Virtual offices: Flexible office solutions that eliminate the need for long-term leases can help startups access professional office spaces and amenities as needed, reducing overhead costs.

Freelance platforms: These platforms enable startups to hire skilled professionals on a project basis. When we first started, we found hiring freelancers for tasks such as graphic design and content creation was especially beneficial. This approach allowed us to access high-quality work while managing our budget effectively.

Open-source software: Open-source software can offer functionality without the hefty price tags of proprietary software, though there are risks startups should consider before adopting these solutions.

Best Practices When Adopting New Technology

When adopting new technology, it’s essential for founders to follow best practices to ensure successful integration and maximize benefits. One key strategy is to thoroughly evaluate each tool to ensure it aligns with your startup's specific needs and goals. It's also important to avoid overwhelming your team by implementing too many new tools at once. Instead, introduce them gradually, and ensure each one addresses a distinct need.

Training is crucial as well. Provide comprehensive onboarding and support to help your team adapt to new systems effectively.

Lastly, continuously review and assess the effectiveness of the tools you've implemented to ensure they continue to meet your evolving needs. I've found it helpful to ask the following questions:

1. Is this tool still aligned with our current business objectives?

2. How frequently is the team using this tool, and are they using it as intended?

3. What measurable impact has this tool had on our productivity or efficiency?

4. Are there any new alternatives on the market that might better suit our evolving needs?

If a tool is no longer effective, gather feedback from your team about why the tool isn't meeting their needs. Then, research alternative solutions that address the identified shortcomings, plan a phased transition to minimize disruption if switching to a new tool, and provide training and support for any new solution implemented.

This continuous evaluation process can help your startup maintain an efficient and effective tech stack that evolves with your business's needs. Ultimately, when you take a strategic approach to implementing new technology, you can enhance the effectiveness of your startup.

In addition, AI and other workplace transformations mean that employees need to continuously “upskill” or “reskill” to progress at their current company or move on to something bigger and better, increasing the cost of education.

“Student loan debt-related benefits have been solving critical staffing and turnover issues for employers in healthcare and education for a long time,” says Scott Thompson, CEO of Tuition.io. Scott continued, “We’re now seeing this strategy emerge in other industries looking to appeal to the next generation of workers, as Healthcare and 401(k) benefits just aren’t as relevant for younger, healthier employees with high living expenses.” While most employers are still on the sidelines some forward-looking and responsive companies stand out as setting the next standard of benefits for the future workforce.

Verizon is one of those companies. Earlier this year Verizon implemented its Secure Your Future program. Starting on day one of employment, employees can get up to a 6% company matching 401(k) contribution by making qualified student loan payments. “When the Secure 2.0 Act was passed, we saw it as an opportunity to offer another way for our employees to earn a matching contribution to our retirement plan,” stated Kevin Cammarata, Vice President of Benefits at Verizon. He continued, “We aimed to bridge the gap between employees’ immediate financial needs and long-term goals, which can be a differentiator with those that are wrestling with student loan debt.” Verizon reports over 1,800 employees have enrolled in the benefit since the program launched.

Technology also now plays a more significant role in benefits selection and administration for digitally savvy employers and employees. Self-service benefits management has become necessary for forward thinking companies, especially those trying to attract employees of all ages and stages.

Thompson summarized “Gen Z has been hit hardest by student loan debt, and employers must find solutions that ease the pain. By supporting individual financial wellness and career growth, companies can both stand out to this population and solve the damaging impact of turnover on organizational performance.”"

NURPHOTO VIA GETTY IMAGES

We believe that Monster Beverage stock is a better pick than its peer – Keurig Dr Pepper stock (NASDAQ: KDP). MNST stock trades at a higher multiple of 7x sales, versus 3.3x revenues for KDP. This gap in valuation makes sense, given Monster Beverage’s superior revenue growth, profitability, and financial position. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think MNST will outperform KDP in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation in an interactive dashboard analysis – Keurig Dr Pepper vs. Monster Beverage, parts of which are summarized below.

1. Keurig Dr Pepper Stock Has Fared Better Than Monster Beverage

KDP stock has witnessed gains of 35% from levels of $30 in early January 2021 to around $40 now, vs. an increase of about 10% for MNST from $45 to $50 over the same period. In comparison, the broader S&P500 saw 45% gains over this roughly four-year period. However, the increase in these stocks has been far from consistent. Returns for KDP stock were 17% in 2021, -1% in 2022, and -4% in 2023, while MNST stock saw returns of 4%, 6%, and 13% over these years, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 — indicating that KDP and MNST underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2023.

In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Staples sector including WMT, PG, and COST, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

2. But Monster Beverage Has Seen Better Revenue Growth

Keurig Dr Pepper saw its sales rise at an average annual rate of 8.5% from $11.6 billion in 2020 to $14.8 billion in 2023, while Monster Beverage’s sales grew at an average rate of 15.8% from $4.6 billion to $7.1 billion over the same period.

Keurig Dr Pepper’s revenue growth benefited from at-home demand for K-Cups due to a sudden surge in at-home consumption during the pandemic phase. While the company has benefited from pricing gains in recent years, its U.S. coffee segment sales have been trending lower lately, amid a weakening consumer spending environment and a shift to lower price point alternatives. The company has the edge over other beverage companies as its coffee segment remains an important long-term growth driver, with people moving away from carbonated drinks and replacing them with other beverages. That said, Keurig Dr Pepper’s refreshment beverages business has been doing better lately.

Monster Beverage’s revenue growth has been driven by a solid demand for its energy drinks. New product launches and expansion in international markets along with a pricing growth has also bolstered its overall top-line expansion lately. For perspective, its average sales per case (24 eight-ounce servings) declined from $9.06 in 2020 to $8.82 in 2022 but saw a sharp rebound to $9.01 in 2023. The total number of cases sold surged by 52% between 2020 and 2023. Monster Beverage will likely continue to see its sales trend higher, led by volume and pricing gains.

3. Monster Beverage Is More Profitable

Keurig Dr Pepper’s operating margin of 21.6% in 2023 declined marginally from 21.9% in 2020, while Monster Beverage’s operating margin contracted from 35.5% to 27.4% over this period. This can be attributed to supply chain constraints and falling prices for Monster Beverage. This situation reversed in 2023, with support from pricing actions and the company’s decreased reliance on imported cans. Looking at the last twelve-month period, Monster Beverage’s operating margin of 27.3% fares slightly better than 23% for Keurig Dr Pepper.

4. Monster Beverage Also Offers Lower Financial Risk

Looking at financial risk, Monster Beverage has an edge over Keurig Dr Pepper. Its 1% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 32% for the latter. Moreover, its 19% cash as a percentage of assets is significantly higher than 1% for Keurig Dr Pepper, implying that Monster Beverage has a better debt position and more cash cushion.

5. The Net of It All

We see that Monster Beverage has demonstrated better revenue growth, is more profitable, and has a better financial position. Looking at the prospects, we believe MNST is still the better choice of the two, despite its rising valuation multiple. KDP stock trades at 3.3x trailing revenues, versus the 3.5x average P/S ratio seen over the last five years. In contrast, MNST stock trades at 7x revenues, versus the 5x average P/S ratio seen over the last five years. This can be attributed to strong sales growth and a rebound in operating margins lately, a trend expected to continue in the near-term. Looking forward, Monster Beverage will likely continue to enjoy a higher valuation multiple, given its recent pricing actions and focus on cutting costs. There has been a robust growth in demand for energy drinks, evident from Monster Beverage’s 52% growth in number of cases sold since 2020. This trend is expected to continue, with the company’s new product launches and expansion in international markets.

While MNST may outperform KDP in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Keurig Dr Pepper’s peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

personalized debt payoff plan best practices,Why Applying To All Eight Ivy League Schools Could Hurt Your Chances Of Admission,"Many students believe applying to all Ivy League schools will improve their chances after hearing about others accepted to all 8, but this approach doesn't mean success.",http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2024/09/17/why-applying-to-all-eight-ivy-league-schools-could-hurt-your-chances-of-admission/,"Yale University

GETTY

In the spring of 2024, Bronx high school student Malena Galletto made headlines after being accepted to all eight Ivy League schools—in addition to the 20 other schools to which she had applied. Incredible stories of students like Malena defying the admissions odds circulate every spring, and while they certainly inspire students, they also mislead them.

Many students who read about the unbelievable successes of those accepted to all eight Ivies assume that they can improve their own odds by simply applying to all of the Ivy League schools. However, this is not the case, and devoting time and energy to completing eight Ivy League applications is actually a detrimental strategy for most students—here’s why:

1. Every Ivy League School is Distinct

While many students and parents regard “the Ivy League” as a homogenous bloc of elite schools, the league is made up of vastly different schools, each with its own character, offerings, and campus—and every Ivy League school is not a good fit for every student. When compiling their balanced college lists, students should think strategically about the types of programs, campuses, learning environments, and communities they want access to. Do you want to attend a small school with a low student-to-faculty ratio or a large school with a plethora of opportunities? Are you interested in conducting lab research or are you more focused on the classroom experience? Will you thrive in a city or a rural setting? A student’s college list should be reflective of their answers to these questions and thus tailored to their needs and goals—both personal and academic.

A student who approaches their college list in this way will almost certainly not craft a list that includes all eight Ivy Leagues. While Dartmouth students are minutes away from hiking and skiing opportunities in rural New Hampshire, Columbia undergraduates have New York City’s entertainment and internships at their immediate disposal. Harvard offers students a highly traditional and structured academic environment. Meanwhile, Brown is known for its Open Curriculum and its diverse, creative, and interdisciplinary approach to education—one that is best suited for students who gravitate toward multiple different disciplines or want to think outside the box. As a land-grant institution, Cornell attracts students who are community minded and who want to use their learning to benefit not only the college but also Ithaca’s tight-knit community, while UPenn is known for graduating students who have a global mindset and are prepared to enter the upper echelons of their professions. In other words, students should not regard Ivy League schools as synonymous with “elite education,” but should instead weigh their interest in each individual school based on its programs, culture, and unique offerings.

2. Applying to All Eight Schools Doesn’t Increase Your Odds of Admission

It’s a common misconception that applying to all eight Ivy League schools will improve your chances of acceptance to at least one. First and foremost, students should note that applying to eight schools, all with single-digit acceptance rates, does nothing to increase their odds at any single one of them. On the contrary, it actually detracts from a student’s overall odds of admission by overloading their college list with reach schools at the expense of matches and safeties. That is to say, students are hedging their bets at schools where they face overwhelming odds of rejection (even if they are highly qualified), rather than balancing their list with schools that they are more likely to earn acceptance to.

Additionally, each Ivy League school has its own specific admissions criteria—just as every Ivy League school is not a fit for every student, every student is not a fit for every Ivy League school. A standout Ivy League application is meticulously tailored to demonstrate a student’s unique qualifications for a specific institution. Students who apply to all eight schools often cut corners, overgeneralize their reasons for applying, or tailor their answers to what they assume “Ivy League admissions officers” want to hear—all of which can negatively impact their chances of acceptance. Those who truly wish to attend a given Ivy League school should focus dedicated energy on leveling up their application materials to the particular school that aligns with their authentic interests and goals and ensure that they are putting their best foot forward in their materials.

3. Hyper-Focusing on the Ivy League Can Distract You from Better Matches

If you are applying to all eight Ivy League schools simply because of their prestige, not only will you likely craft inauthentic and unimpressive applications, but you will also miss out on other great schools that may be a better fit for you. Remember that rankings and low admissions rates are not the only measures of a school’s rigor and excellence. Rather than devoting countless hours to writing supplemental essays for every Ivy League school, you should spend your time researching a diversity of schools that house strong programs in your intended area of study. If you are interested in STEM, for instance, you might find that CalTech or UT Austin’s innovative and forward-thinking programs are a better fit for you than Harvard’s traditional option.

Ultimately, students should not apply to all eight Ivy League institutions—or any school—just for the sake of applying or because of the prestige associated with earning an acceptance. At the same time, students can gain strategic insights from the inspiring students who were accepted to all eight Ivies. How did some of the students deciding between all of the Ivies make their choice? In 2014, Kwasi Enin chose Yale after visiting the campus and enjoying the school’s residential college system and friendly student body. Craig McFarland originally chose Yale, but changed his plans when the pandemic forced him to reprioritize having a support system nearby, leading him to choose Harvard. Ashley Adirika—a Florida teen who was accepted to all eight Ivies in 2022—made her decision based on the strength of Harvard’s academic offerings in her field of interest: “[W]hen I did further research for what I want to do specifically, which is explorations in policy and social policy and things of that nature, Harvard just had a better program.”"

Record-breaking heatwaves, devastating wildfires, and catastrophic floods are becoming the norm rather than the exception as the world warms. 2023 was one of the warmest years on record according to the World Meteorological Organization and 2024 is likely to be even hotter.

The relentless burning of fossil fuels and the degradation of ecosystems are the root causes of this dangerous warming. To speed up the switch from coal, oil and gas to cleaner energies, and protect and restore nature, countries must submit ambitious and investible national climate plans which are called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.

NDCs are the cornerstone of global climate efforts. They represent each country's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate. They should be renewed every five years, represent a progression beyond the previous plan, and reflect the highest possible ambition of each country. New NDCs for 2035 are due by next year.

A new report from the We Mean Business Coalition underlines how ambitious NDCs can drive accelerated private sector investment in the transition to a clean and nature-positive economy.

The report calls on countries and businesses to work together to propose their NDCs and plans, which should reduce emissions in line with science. More importantly they should offer enough clarity for companies to invest confidently. To this end, the plans should include targets to phase out unabated fossil fuels and replace with more renewable energy and energy efficiency, and halt and reverse deforestation.

The paper also emphasizes the importance of translating NDCs into concrete policy and actions and of increased government-business collaboration.

Adopting such an approach is essential because today private investment is woefully inadequate to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C as pledged under the Paris Agreement. The United Nations Environment Programme shows that the current NDCs would result in a 2.5C to 2.9C increase by the end of the century. Scientists are warning that higher levels of warming will be dangerous and very costly.

Current NDCs are not just falling short on ambition, but also on the details of how governments plan to drive investment in clean technologies and actively replace the fossil fuel system and infrastructure. Long-term certitude is fundamental to business. Companies need five-to-ten-year coherent government plans showing politicians are serious about accelerating the transition from fossil to clean to give them the confidence to scale investments in this direction.

And the reason business needs thought-through, coherent policy planning is because pollution and global warming has the ability to significantly disturb the operating environment for all businesses, whether large or small. From trade disruptions, damaging weather events and threats to resources and raw materials, to financial risks from rising insurance costs, volatile energy pricing, changing cost of land, labor and resources – there is much that good policy can prepare for.

The transition to a clean economy is also a massive opportunity. The shift to cleaner business models will offer a competitive advantage positioning companies at the forefront of technologies that are proving cheaper in the long run. Renewables, particularly solar and wind, are increasingly more cost-effective than fossil fuels. Reports from BloombergNEF show that solar and wind now represent 91% of new power capacity additions in 2023, indicating a significant cost advantage. The IEA estimates that around USD 2.8 trillion was invested in energy in 2023, of which more than USD 1.7 trillion went to clean energy. There is also growing evidence that companies that prioritize renewable energy are often viewed more favorably by consumers and investors.

A recent survey shows that investors believe clean energy investments will outperform most other sectors and earn investors money in the short and long term. They recognize that climate risks are significant business risks that, if ignored, could hurt the financial performance of companies and investment portfolios. They also believe that retail investors expect clean energy to outperform every sector except AI over the next 10 years.

Many businesses are already focused on accelerating change. More than 260 companies, collectively generating over $1.6 trillion in revenue, are working to phase out unabated fossil fuels under the Fossil to Clean campaign. And thousands of other companies are setting science-based targets, developing climate transition plans and investing in net-zero solutions.

Credible NDCs need to incorporate tangible ambition to accelerate clean energy and address deforestation, they must provide relevant plans, policies and incentives, and be able to work in lockstep with implementing departments and bodies. With these in place, countries can attract private capital and knowledge, and in doing so, create the ambition loop that can keep 1.5C in sight."

[+]

GETTY IMAGES

Amid a 9-6 month, with a 2.5 game cushion in the Wild Card standing, the Kansas City Royals will need their MVP Bobby Witt Jr to finish the season as strong as his first five months were up to this point.

And for those five months, Witt has compiled one of the best seasons in Royals history.

With a league-leading .332 batting average, 200 hits, and 122 runs, the former 2nd overall pick enters Tuesday with a .984 OPS 9.0 bWAR, and 9.9fWAR as the team’s everyday shortstop. Witt has been amongst the league’s-best at the toughest infield position, with just 14 errors on 537 chances, and 17 outs above average.

According to Fangraphs WAR, Witt’s season is the best in Royals history, beating out the best of George Brett’s career and other franchise legends like Darrell Porter and John Mayberry.

However, up to this point of the season, Witt’s breakout year will not end with the same hardware as Brett’s did in 1980, as the current odds still favor the Yankees captain by a large margin.

But, with about a dozen games remaining for both the Royals and Yankees, is there anything Witt can do to make the competition closer come the end of September?

Even though the Paw Patrol Curse has officially come to an end for Aaron Judge, hitting two home runs in the last 4-game set with Boston, number 99 is still amidst his worst stretch of the season since his slow start to the year, with a .239/.386/.388/.774 slash line in his last 19 games.

That being said, Judge does have the advantage on Witt in most statistical categories up to this point, and it is not particularly close.

Witt Jr. Judge

bWAR 9.0 9.7

fWAR 9.9 10.0

G 151 148

H 200 169

HR 32 53

RBI 108 132

SB 29 9

BA .332 .321

OBP .384 .455

SLG .600 .692

OPS .984 1.147

Even if they hit at the same rate as their previous 15-game stretches, Witt would only surpass Judge in batting average and tie him in fWAR. So the conversation would have to expand to more than just their season statistics.

The one argument for Witt would be his supporting cast. After losing Vinnie Pasuantino to the IL, Witt lost his main source of protection in the batting order, and was just the third member of the team with more than 17 homers on the season.

Alongside Salvador Perez, these three bats were the only members of the offense with an OPS+ over 105, as Michael Massey and Freddy Fermin are the only two players with an OPS above the league average.

While the Yankees offense has seemed to be a two-headed monster for a majority of the year, with Judge benefiting from Juan Soto’s first year in pinstripes, their offense as a whole has not been as complete either.

However, to have Austin Wells and Giancarlo Stanton both owning an OPS+ of 113, Gleyber Torres improving offensively to end the season, and the upside of Jasson Dominguez and Anthony Rizzo at the bottom of the order is a lot more challenging for an opposing pitcher to deal with than the young squad in Kansas City.

Witt’s defensive abilities at a premiere position would also give him a leg up over

GETTY IMAGES

Judge, despite Judge also playing one of the three toughest positions in baseball for over two-thirds of his games played (98 games in CF).

While Judge does not rank as high in the advanced metrics as Witt does amongst shortstops, Judge has made a concerted effort to only make the appropriate plays when playing centerfield. With a 1.000 fielding percentage and 4 assists in 844 innings, the 6’7, 282 lb outfielder is not trying to run through any more fences.

The last consideration a voter may have in Witt’s favor would be regarding the jump the Royals made as a team behind Witt’s career year.

After a 56-106 record in 2023, which was worse than their 97-loss 2022 season, an 80-win season was seen as far-fetched heading into the 2024 campaign. Now, with a 94.6% chance to reach the playoffs, Witt deserves the benefit of his play leading a newcomer into October.

However, even if Witt does join the likes of players like Mike Trout and Alex Rodriguez and recent players to post 10+ WAR seasons and not win the MVP, it’s safe to say Witt would take one less trophy on his mantle for his first real chance at a ring."
budgeting for extra debt payments strategies,Most Important Letter This Year? Your Part D Annual Notice Of Changes,This year's Medicare Open Enrollment is set to be one of the most important ones ever. It starts with your Part D Annual Notice of Changes.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/dianeomdahl/2024/09/17/most-important-letter-this-year-your-part-d-annual-notice-of-changes/,"Be on the lookout for one of the most important letters you'll get this year.

GETTY

You probably find lots of junk mail in your mailbox. But, if you are one of the 50 million beneficiaries with Part D prescription drug coverage, either through a stand-alone Part D drug plan or incorporated into a Medicare Advantage plan, pay attention now. Buried in that stack of mail will be the Annual Notice of Changes (ANOC), a letter about Open Enrollment and your Part D drug coverage for next year.

The Open Enrollment Period, October 15-December 7, is your chance to ensure you have the best plan in 2025 and the ANOC is your guide to the changes. A KFF analysis showed that only 3 in 10 beneficiaries (29%) compared their current plan with others during Open Enrollment. If I had the space, I could share dozens of tales of woe from those who got caught asleep at the wheel and woke up on January 2 to unpleasant cost and coverage issues.

This may be the most important Open Enrollment you have experienced. Why do I believe that? Six words – the $2,000 cap on drug costs. According to a White House fact sheet, this cap will save nearly 19 million Part D enrollees at least $400 next year. However, it will create cost and coverage challenges for many. Part D drug plans will pick up most of these costs so they likely will implement measures to reduce the hit. The elimination of the 5% Catastrophic Coverage coinsurance is one small step toward the $2,000 cap that is expected to save 1.5 million drug plan enrollees about $3,100. 65 Incorporated reviewed 2024 drug plans to identify the impact.

59 of 65 plans increased their monthly premiums, anywhere from 2% to 84%.
Almost a third of drug plans changed a copayment to a coinsurance. One example, instead of $47, the cost sharing is 25%, increasing the out-of-pocket cost.
And 30% of plans increased the coinsurance for Tier 4 and Tier 5 drugs. Even a change of 1-2% can increase costs by several hundred dollars a month.

We can expect to see more of the same with 2025 plans.




Here’s What To Do with the Annual Notice

Insurers sponsoring Part D coverage must send an ANOC to all plan members by September 30. The notice can be 15-30 pages or more, depending on your plan. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has a template that identifies some important pages. Check these out.

Page 4: A summary of important costs for 2025.

This summarizes the changes in premium and drug tier cost sharing. You’ll discover whether your premium is increasing and/or the tier costs for your drugs will change, especially a copayment changing to a coinsurance.

Page 6: Section 1, unless you choose another plan …

The plan you have this year may not be around next year. If that happens, you will be enrolled automatically in another plan. When this has happened in the past, plans tended to assign enrollees to the one with the highest premium.

Page 7: Section 2.2, changes to the pharmacy network.

The plan will alert you if changes have been made but you will have to research which pharmacies are in or out.

Page 8: Section 2.3, changes to Part D prescription drug coverage.

This is one of the most important sections in the ANOC. The plan must provide a copy of the drug list (unlikely) or electronically (a link). If there have been no changes to covered drugs, tier assignments, or restrictions (prior authorization, step therapy), you can breathe a sigh of relief. However, in the current environment, it’s more likely that there will be changes. The ANOC emphasizes, “Review the Drug List to make sure your drugs will be covered next year and to see if there will be any restrictions, or if your drug has been moved to a different cost-sharing tier.”

Pages 11-16: Changes to your cost-sharing in the drug payment stages.

You’ll find out the plan’s deductible and standard and preferred cost-sharing in each payment stage.




Next Steps

The ANOC will identify the changes in your plan but then, it’s up to you. You’ll need the Medicare Plan Finder to determine the impact of changes. 2025 plan information will start appearing in early October. CMS has a video, “2023 How to use Medicare Plan Finder, step-by-step,” that provides a good introduction to using this tool.

Here are a few questions you should answer.

Are all your medications covered?
How much will you pay for drugs?
Did your pharmacy network change?
Are there new restrictions on your medications?
Is your premium increasing?

After completing this research, if your current plan will be the best for you in 2025, do nothing. The plan will renew automatically. However, if another plan will be better, enroll in it. The deadline is December 7 but don’t wait until the last minute. Things can get crazy.

With all the changes, there is little doubt that the 2024 Open Enrollment Period will be very important. The Annual Notice of Changes is your guide to identifying the best drug coverage in 2025 and the Medicare Plan Finder is the tool. Don’t blow this opportunity."

Drivers are more likely to multitask and not pay close attention when using partial automation systems, doing things like eating, grooming ,using electronics, and some even engage in this kind of risky behavior even while “following” the rules for attention requirements, quickly learning to skirt set limits.

Those are the highlights of new research based on two studies that examined how drivers interact with and use partially automated driving systems, released on Tuesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit financed by the insurance industry. Both month-long studies were conducted with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AgeLab.

Partial automation systems use cameras and other sensors that can keep cars moving down the road in the center of the lane at a selected speed, slowing down to avoid other vehicles and accelerating when the way is clear, researchers said, but drivers are supposed to pay close attention to what’s happening on the road and be ready to take over at any time.

But the studies found that not all drivers do.

“These results are a good reminder of the way people learn,” David Harkey, the Insurance Institute’s president, said in a statement. “If you train them to think that paying attention means nudging the steering wheel every few seconds, then that’s exactly what they’ll do.”

“In both these studies, drivers adapted their behavior to engage in distracting activities,” Harkey added, noting that the research underscores the importance of “why partial automation systems need more robust safeguards,” like driver monitoring systems, to prevent misuse and ensure that drivers pay attention to the technology and the road.

In the first study, “Rinse and repeat: behavior change associated with using partial automation among three samples of drivers during a 4-week field trial,”drivers were much more likely to check their phones, eat a sandwich or do other visual-manual activities while using Volvo’s Pilot Assist partial automation system than when driving unassisted.

In the analysis of driver behavior, researchers examined how likely drivers were to engage in non driving activities when using the automation compared to when they were not and then evaluated how this relationship changed over time.

Overall, they found that the tendency to multitask increased over time for some drivers as they grew more comfortable – drivers became bolder and more complacent as they got used to the technology. Other drivers were more distracted while using the system from the start.

The study monitored driving at various stages of software updates that improved the lane-centering feature and attention reminders, but all versions required the driver to keep their hands on the steering wheel.

Regardless of the version of the system used, drivers engaged in distracting visual-manual activities, including eating, grooming and using electronics, more often when using Pilot Assist than while driving without it, whether they used the feature a lot or hardly at all.

“The takeaway for me was that the technology was linked to more distraction,” Ian Reagan, senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute and the study’s lead researcher, said in a statement.

A second study, “Finding windows of opportunity: how drivers adapt to partial automation safeguards over time,” examined how the driving behavior of people who had never used Tesla’s Autopilot or any other partial automation system changed over a month-long period.

The study focused on how often the drivers triggered the system’s initial attention reminders, escalated warnings and emergency slowdown and lockout procedures. It found that many drivers using Tesla’s Autopilot system quickly mastered the timing interval of its attention reminder feature so that they could prevent warnings from escalating to more serious interventions.

Drivers did nondriving secondary activities, looked away from the road, and had both hands off the wheel more often during the alerts and in the 10 seconds before and after them as they learned how the attention reminders worked, researchers said, and the longer drivers used the system, the less time it took them to take their hands off the wheel again once the alerts stopped.

“These results show that escalating, multimodal attention reminders are very effective in getting drivers to change their behavior,” Alexandra Mueller, senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute and the second study’s lead author, said in a statement. “However, better safeguards are needed to ensure that the behavior change actually translates to more attentive driving.”

Earlier this year, the Insurance Institute launched a new ratings program to encourage automakers to incorporate more robust safeguards into their partial driving automation systems.

Hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been hit with serious charges, including sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution. Authorities arrested the music icon after a sealed indictment was filed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). In response, Combs’ legal team is pushing for his release on a staggering $50 million bail package, secured by two of his Miami properties—one of which is appraised at $48 million, according to court filings.

Prosecutors are pushing back and asking that Combs remain behind bars until his trial, labeling him “dangerous”and a “flight risk” in the wake of his arrest.

The indictment against Combs alleges that he was responsible for several criminal enterprises involving sex trafficking, forced labor and prostitution. Combs’ arrest, which occurred a day before the 14-page indictment was unsealed on Tuesday morning, sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and social media. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York allege in detail that for years, Combs used his power and influence to fly under the radar and take advantage of women by committing serious violations of federal law. The charges, which include racketeering—a crime often associated with organized crime syndicates—paint a picture of a long-running and intricate operation. Sex trafficking is the coercion, fraud, or force used to compel people into commercial sex acts, while racketeering under the RICO Act allows prosecutors to go after individuals involved in ongoing criminal enterprises.

Since the news broke, Combs’ attorneys have been making attempts to clear the client’s name and in a released statement, Combs’ legal team, led by attorney Marc Agnifilo, is fighting hard to show their client’s innocence.

“We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” Agnifilo said. “Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the Black community. He is an imperfect person but he is not a criminal.”

Agnifilo and his team may face an uphill battle due to the SDNY’s conviction rate.

The SDNY is one of the most prominent federal courts in the United States and is known for handling high-profile cases, including financial crimes, terrorism and organized crime and the conviction rate in federal courts, including the SDNY, is also high with federal prosecutors boasting a conviction rate of approximately 90% to 95%. According to the United States Sentencing Commission, the SDNY specifically has a high conviction rate, with over 95% of all criminal cases resulting in a guilty plea.

In 2023, singer Cassie Ventura, who previously dated Combs for over a decade, filed a 35-page federal lawsuit accusing Combs of violent abuse and coercion, claiming he forced her into drug-fueled sex parties he called “freak offs.” In the lawsuit, Ventura stated that Combs signed her to his record label, Bad Boy Records when she was 19 and he was 37; their business relationship soon became personal and volatile when Combs took complete control of her life.

A day after Ventura’s lawsuit, Combs agreed to a settlement. Ventura said, “I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans, and lawyers for their unwavering support.”

During that time, Combs denied the allegations, but after CNN released a disturbing video of the rapper physically assaulting and dragging Ventura in a hotel hallway, the rapper-producer later apologized in an Instagram video.

Four days after filing her lawsuit, Ventura, through her attorneys, asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit following an alleged multi-million dollar settlement, but while the lawsuit appeared to be quickly settled, it seemed to trigger more controversy because soon after, five more women come forward with similar accusations in quick succession and gave weight to a federal prosecution.

Four months after Ventura’s lawsuit was dismissed, armed Department of Homeland Security agents raided Combs' Holmby Hills mansion in Los Angeles and his Miami waterfront home. Among the items they seized included—narcotics, guns, ammunition, over 1,000 bottles of baby oil, and lubricants—are described as “freak off supplies” in the indictment, and prosecutors believe that much of this evidence bolsters their case.

This case is the most high-profile prosecution of a music industry figure since the conviction and downfall of R&B singer R. Kelly, who was charged with child sex crimes, sex trafficking and racketeering. Kelly is now serving a 20-year prison sentence and Combs’ case indicates a striking similarity between the two cases, which shows a troubling pattern of sexual misconduct in the music business.

Combs’ 30-year career once secured him as a cultural architect who shaped the careers of icons like The Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige and built out the alcoholic brand Ciroc, but the recent charges continue to threaten to upend his legacy."
