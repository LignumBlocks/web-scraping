But between rent and other bills I have ‘very little’ in the bank each month. Should I hire a pro to help?,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/im-stretched-thin-im-23-and-make-75k-a-year-living-in-the-northeast-but-between-rent-and-other-bills-i-have-very-little-in-the-bank-each-month-should-i-hire-a-pro-to-help-01675297667?mod=search_headline,"Question: I’m 23 and living in a high-cost area in Rhode Island. I make a $75,000 salary, plus monthly bonuses that will hopefully get me near six figures by the end of the year. I’ve worked full time since graduating high school and have build up my career without dipping into college debt. Other than the occasional expense, I rarely hold a credit card balance, and have been making a solid income (excluding 2020).

That said, I struggle balancing my income with my expenses. I’m stretched thin between rent, car payment, insurance, bills, and more miscellaneous expenses than I’d really like to admit, and I find myself with very little in my bank account before my next paycheck clears. In between all of these expenses, I manage to throw money into high yield savings, a robo investment account, Roth, and 401k, yet I almost feel like I’m putting too much money elsewhere. (Looking for a new financial adviser?

I’m thinking I don’t really need a financial planner, as I really have a good grasp on where my money’s going, I use target date funds in my 401(k) and IRA, and I’m not really looking for investment advice. I really just need help making sure I’m not over investing, managing my budget and not making a wild money mistake in the future. I did see that there are money coaches you can hire to assist, and I think I like that idea, although I had true sticker shock when prices started having a comma in them. What do you recommend?

Answer: First of all, congrats on starting to both save and invest at such a young age, and know that it’s normal to feel uncertainty about these things. As for whether you need a pro —- be it a financial adviser or money coach —- to help you: That depends, and we will weigh that out for you.

Financial planner vs. money coach

Whether it’s a money coach or a financial planner, a good one could help answer your questions and get you on track financially. The issue is that the terms financial planner and adviser and money coach aren’t regulated, so most anyone can call themselves one —- and not all of them are good.

In general, a financial planner likely will focus more on the investing advice side of things, though many can also help with boosting savings, creating a smart budget and more. “A financial planner actually does the things you say you need help with, like making sure you’re not over investing, managing your budget and making sure you’re not making a wild money mistake in the future,” says certified financial planner Philip Mock at 1522 Financial. Meanwhile, a money coach generally focuses more on helping clients understand and change their relationship with money, as well as things like budgeting, tackling debt and savings more.

All that said, you could likely benefit from either a money coach or a financial planner, if you found the right one. Should you go for the financial planner route, you may want a certified financial planner (CFP). These individuals have passed rigorous coursework on personal finance, participate in continuing education requirements every two years, and are fiduciaries who adhere to a code of ethics including acting in the client’s best interests and avoiding or disclosing conflicts of interest.

You’re probably picturing a traditional financial adviser who will charge a percentage of your assets under management. But in your case, it likely makes sense to opt for an adviser who charges you hourly or on a per-plan basis. Hourly fees tend to range from about $200-$500 an hour, and for the creation of a one-time financial plan you can follow, you might pay something like $5,000-$7,500.

Should you opt for a money coach, you may want to look for one with either the AFCPE’s Accredited Financial Counselor or Financial Fitness Coach designation; you might pay roughly $100-$350 an hour for those services.

Whoever you choose, vet the individual, and ask for references. “Be careful in selecting a professional to work with,”  says Mock. This guide offers up 15 questions you should ask any financial pro you might want to hire. And look too for a professional who has worked with individuals like you: Indeed, given your stage of life, you’ll probably want to find a planner who specializes in Gen Z and can help you navigate the issues you’ll face as you accumulate money over the next decades.

But should you do it yourself?

You can certainly take the DIY approach, and it’s the most cost effective. Start by going deep into your financial education with resources that could help you DIY your finances. These include free online courses like Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making offered by Edx.org, Personal Finance 101 offered by Udemy.com, Purdue University’s self-guided Planning for a Secure Retirement course and Duke University’s Behavioral Finance Course offered through Coursera.org.

Additionally, books like “I Will Teach You To Be Rich” by Ramit Sethi, “The Simple Path to Wealth” by J.L. Collins and “The Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey can also be helpful tools in understanding personal finance basics. 

However, remember this: If you don’t feel like you have the time or desire to manage your own finances, it might not go that well for you.  “Most people aren’t that interested so they don’t spend time on it and then they don’t like the results,” says certified financial planner Adam Koos at Libertas Wealth Management. (Looking for a new financial adviser? This free tool from our partner SmartAsset can match you to a fiduciary adviser.)

Other things to know

Target date funds are not necessarily bad investments, but “just be aware that they are not always what they seem. Each fund company has a different interpretation of what the proper investment allocation is per date and some make gradual adjustments while others make abrupt changes. Generally speaking, you’re better off building your own allocation within the investment options available” says certified financial planner Joe Favorito at Landmark Wealth Management. 

What’s more, he adds: “It’s important to save in the most tax efficient way, as well as using the correct vehicles for the right goals. Asset location is an important part of financial planning, so if you’re planning on buying a home, then those dollars need to be in a more liquid account such as a high yield savings account.”

benefits of high-yield savings accounts vs traditional savings accounts,CDs vs. bonds: What’s the difference?,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/cds-vs-bonds-whats-the-difference-3c12d2fe?mod=search_headline,"Bonds and certificates of deposit can both have a place in your portfolio, but there are plenty of similarities, and differences, you should know about before diving in.

Broadly, certificates of deposit are accounts are a type of savings account offered by a financial institution — such as a bank or credit union — that tend to pay a fixed rate of return over a set term. They’re considered relatively safe investments, and recently, they’ve been getting plenty of attention as some CDs are now paying 5% or more. See some of the best CD rates you may get here.

Bonds, on the other hand, are a form of investment that loans money to a company or government and that typically earn a fixed interest rate of return on that investment along the way. Bonds vary in their level of risk, with some considered very safe, and others risky.

These two investments have dozens of characteristics that set them apart, but also plenty of similarities. Here’s what you need to know about certificates of deposit and bons.

What are certificates of deposit and bonds? 
Certificates of deposit (CDs): A definition

Certificates of deposit are used by some 44% of American savers today, according to a recent Forbes report. Some 51% of those participants say they invest their money in CDs in order to achieve short-term savings goals, while 47% say they use them for long-term savings goals, the report found. 

So, what are they exactly? At their root, CDs are financial products offered by banks or credit unions (where they are commonly referred to as share certificates) that come with an inherent promise to their investors of a fixed rate, based on the current interest rates, for making a deposit for a set period of time. These investment periods, also known as maturity dates, can range from as little as 28 days to 10 years, or more — whether these are higher interest rates or lower interest rates will depend on both the financial institution as well as decisions made by the Federal Reserve.

Both banks and credit unions typically require certificate of deposit account holders to deposit a minimum amount of money to get started ranging from $10 to $10,000 or more. One consideration to make when selecting a certificate of deposit from a credit union is that you must also become a member, which can entail holding a specific type of job, living in a particular location or other criteria. Be sure to read the membership rules before selecting a share certificate from a credit union to ensure that you qualify. 

When it comes to making a deposit, it should be noted that customers are also often only insured at banks for up to $250,000 in principal and accrued interest by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also known as the FDIC, regardless of how high their maximum allowable investment goes. The National Credit Union Administration, or NCUA, meanwhile insures the same amount at credit unions.

“Clients typically want CDs for a specific time period, ranging from three to nine months, or one to three years, on average,” says Diane Kessler, senior wealth advisor at Citi. “One thing to keep in mind if opting for a CD is that they may lack liquidity, and you can incur a penalty if you redeem them before they’ve reached maturity.”

When any given certificate of deposit reaches its so-called maturity date, its account holders then have the option to either renew the CD; roll the deposit into a new CD at a new, theoretically higher interest rate; or withdraw your initial deposit plus the interest it has earned over the life of the investment. (See some of the best CD rates you may get here.)

Bonds: A definition

Unlike CDs, these financial products are essentially investments that make a loan to governments and corporations for those various entities to raise money. When you buy or invest in one of these loans, the issuer agrees to pay you back the face value of that loan on a fixed date along with interest payments on your loan throughout the investment period. These payments are often made twice a year. 

There are also various types of bonds, each of which has its own set of rules, risk levels and guidelines. Here are some of the most common bond types, as listed by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy: 

Corporate bonds: These are debt securities that have been issued by private and public corporations. In this case, the company issuing the bond makes a legal commitment to pay interest on the principal investment balance. 
Investment grade bonds: This term refers to bonds that have high credit ratings and by design have a lower level of credit risk. 
High-yield bonds: Although high-yield bonds offer a higher interest rate, they also come with a higher risk for the investor as this category comes with a lower credit rating than investment-grade bonds.
Municipal bonds: This category of bonds, also known as munis, are issued by states, cities, counties and other government bodies. 
General obligation: These government-issued bonds are not secured by assets and are repaid from either state or local general funds, or by way of a dedicated tax. 
Revenue: This form of muni differs from general obligation bonds because they can be repaid through numerous tax sources. These can include bonds for airports, tolls, utilities, mortgages and hospitals, to name a few. 
Conduit: These government bonds are offered on behalf of private entities such as non-profits, colleges or hospitals. Borrowers here agree to repay the issuer, who is responsible for paying the interest and principal on the bonds.
U.S. Treasurys: The federal government issues this type of bond through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These are also considered safe investments because they are backed by the federal government. 
Treasury bills: Also known as T-Bills, this form of Treasury bond has the quickest maturity date for government bonds and can be offered in five different term lengths:  four weeks, eight weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.
T-Notes: Much like T-Bills, T-Notes also mature at a fixed term; however these are offered with slightly longer maturity dates from two to as much as 10 years. 
T-Bonds: These are the longest-term version of a Treasury bond with maturity in 30 years. They are issued and matured at $100 par value and pay interest semi annually. These bonds can also be auctioned once a month.
TIPS: Unlike how traditional Treasury bonds work, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are indexed to inflation; therefore the principal amount can fluctuate throughout the life of the term. If the principal is higher than the original amount you invested, then the bond holder received the increased value of that bond. 
Why do people invest in certificates of deposit and bonds?
Certificates of deposit: Why invest?

As many as 24% of consumers say they chose to invest in CDs because they feel as though they are a safe investment option for their money, according to the Forbes report.

And they are not wrong. Likely the biggest benefit of investing in one of these products is the guaranteed interest rate that can be earned throughout the life of a given note. Because banks or credit unions promise to pay a set rate of interest for staying until the end when it matures — and certificates of deposit are typically FDIC- or NCUA-insured — there is little risk that comes with buying in.

“CDs are considered to be one of the lowest risk and safest investments that can earn a bit more interest than a traditional savings account,” says Kate Redden, a financial adviser, regional director and partner at Merit Financial Advisors. See some of the best CD rates you may get here.

Bonds: Why invest?

Much like CDs, bonds also offer a predictable stream of income, with interest payments often made to shareholders twice per year. They are also often seen as a way to diversify a portfolio away from equities. If they are held to the maturity date, bondholders are also entitled to the entire principal balance.

“Bonds come in many forms with varying levels of risk and should be assessed for both credit and interest rate risk,” Kessler says, adding that “clients should also be mindful that bonds are debt instruments, meaning that there is a risk of default if the issuer fails to pay.”

Comparing CDs and bonds in a glance: Penalties, interest rates, taxes

This chart offers a quick view of these issues, with more detail below.

	CDs	Bonds
Penalties	Early withdrawal penalties from taking money out before a maturity date can range from three months’ interest with maturity dates of less than six months; or as much as 12 months’ interest or more for those maturing at five years.	Withdrawing within the first five years from a savings bond incurs a three-months’ interest penalty. For any withdrawals after 20 months, the bondholder may only receive the first 18 months’ worth of interest.
Interest rates	Once you buy a CD, you generally get a fixed rate over a set period of time. But rates offered before purchase fluctuate and are dependent on the Fed funds rate and decisions made by a given financial institution.
	Interest rate risk can impact a bond’s price depending on current rates and the type of bond. For I bonds, the U.S. Treasury sets rates every May 1 and Nov. 1, based on inflation.
Taxes	Interest is taxed as ordinary income at the depositor’s federal income tax rate.	Bonds are generally taxed on interest and capital gains. This can vary depending on the type of bond, however if interest is taxable, it is generally when you pay income taxes.
Certificate of deposit vs. bond penalties?
Certificate of deposit penalties

While these investment vehicles are indeed low risk, “there is often a withdrawal penalty for withdrawing money from a CD prior to the end of the stated term,” Redden warns. 

These penalties can vary from one financial institution to another and are often calculated as a set period’s worth of interest. If the fine print states that withdrawing your money before the set maturity date results in a penalty of 90 days of interest, your penalty in that case would be the equivalent to 90 days worth of accrued interest on your investment in that particular CD. Since there is also no cap imposed by the federal government on these penalties, financial institutions may also take from your principal balance. 

Bond penalties

Similar to CDs, savings bonds come with penalties for withdrawing within the first five years. That said, those penalties are relatively low, three-month interest rate fees. If you redeem after 20 months, you may only receive the first 18 months’ worth of interest. After the five year period is reached, there is no penalty associated with these bonds.

Impact of interest rates on certificates of deposit and bonds

What makes CDs so attractive to investors is their protection from interest rate volatility.

In the past year, the Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark fed funds rate, which has an impact on rates offered with CDs, from nearly zero to 5%-5.25%. So when you lock in a rate on a fixed-term that comes with a CD, you are now guaranteed to earn the rate offered at the time of investment. If rates happen to rise — which they have done steadily over the past year — investors will have to purchase another CD to get in on the higher rate. 

On the other hand, bondholders must closely monitor interest rates and their impact on any bond they are invested in. That’s because bonds tend to have an inverse relationship with rates. That means when interest rates rise, bond prices often fall; when rates go down, bond prices tend go up.

What about taxes? 
Taxes and certificates of deposit

Investors interested in certificates of deposit will have to take Uncle Sam into consideration. That’s because any interest earned on a CD is typically taxable as regular income.

That is, however, unless you have opened a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA CD. (This type of CD is one way an individual retirement account can invest its various asset portfolios of stocks, bonds or mutual funds.  In this case, IRAs are invested in a CD to earn the fixed rate, however some banks may also offer variable IRA CD APY, which means those rates will fluctuate with the fed funds rate).

In most other instances, though, taxes for CDs will often range from 10% to 37%, depending on your taxable income and filing status. This income tax calculator from Forbes can help determine which bracket you are in. If you’ve earned any form of interest in excess of $10, most banks will often issue a Form 1099-INT to file your earned interest with the IRS. If they are not issued, you may have to request one. 

Taxes and bonds

While CDs can complement investment strategies for many individual and institutional investors by satisfying short-term cash flow needs, Kessler says bonds on the other hand both diversify an investment portfolio away from equities and also “offer some tax advantages” along the way.

Although the interest you earn on corporate bonds is always taxable, most income earned from bonds issued by a state, city or local municipality is often exempt from federal taxes. That said, just like with CDs, you still have to report this income when filing your taxes come tax season by way of Form 1099-INT. 

Hiring a professional

Needless to say, investing in either a CD or a bond can be a complicated process. Because of these various hurdles and fine print involved, you may want a finance professional to help decide which product is best to reach anyone’s individual goals. 

Indeed, if you’re unsure, a financial adviser could help you understand your asset allocation, risk tolerance and other needs to pick the right investments, be they CDs, bonds, equities or something else. “Failing to allocate investments properly can put an individual at risk of outliving their assets and not having enough money to achieve their personal financial goals,” Kessler says.

“High-yielding accounts, often found within online banks and digital banking channels, and certificates of deposit (CDs), are two ways to get more returns on what you can save,” says Katie Catlender, chief customer officer at Cambridge Savings Bank. “This is because interest rates [as of July 2023] are often around 4% APY for high-yield savings and many CDs perform in the 3% to 5% and sometimes higher range.”

What to ask before getting a certificate of deposit or high-yield savings account

Both certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts are considered safe investments, as both are generally FDIC-insured up to $250,000. So how do you pick between the two beyond just the rate paid?

The bottom line when deciding between a savings account or a certificate of deposit is be sure to understand the terms for the specific option you’re considering. “Ask for clarity on the differences, the restrictions, how often you can withdraw and what the penalties are and what the parameters are for minimum and maximum balances — as every financial institution’s products will vary and each institution is invested in helping you understand the solutions and features that best meet your needs,” says Catlender. 

To do this, talk to the financial institution’s branch team members or customer service team by phone, chat or email. “All banks must share their product details through avenues such as website content and disclosure information. All of these aspects and your own unique needs should be considered when thinking about your best fit,” says Catlender.

Understanding certificates of deposit and their basics

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings vehicle that earns interest for a set period of time. Unlike a savings account, money in a CD typically can’t be withdrawn without penalty, and for this reason, they tend to offer higher rates than more liquid savings accounts.

CDs are appealing because they tend to offer higher yields than a savings account, but in exchange, your money gets locked up for a period of time, says Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. 

“CDs are generally available for terms between three months and five years and in general, the longer the term, the higher the interest rate,” says Palmer. But right now, there’s an inverted yield curve, meaning shorter term bond yields are higher than longer bond yields — and some say that can be a precursor to a recession.

Interest rates on CDs are locked in for a predetermined time frame during which the consumer cannot touch their funds. Most commonly, CD terms last between 6-months and 5-years, with some as short as 3-months and some as long as 10-years.  CDs remain one of the safest places to park money that’s needed at a specific point in time, because the return is guaranteed and typically protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) up to $250,000.

Understanding savings accounts and their basics

Known for their safety and reliability, savings accounts are interest-bearing accounts at banks or credit unions that offer liquidity. It’s typically easy to withdraw money at any time, though interest rates also can typically change at any time.

“If you need to beef up your emergency fund or might need cash at a moment’s notice, then put your money in a savings account. A savings account is great for an emergency fund or a temporary parking place for money,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.

CD vs. savings account: Exploring differences and advantages

Funds placed in savings accounts are liquid and available within a few days time frame, whereas funds in CDs are typically placed for a specific period of time. You may be charged an early withdrawal penalty if you access the funds prior to the maturity date of the CD. 

“The advantage of a savings account is almost immediate liquidity and access to the funds. The advantage of a CD is to lock in a potentially higher interest rate for a set period of time, while savings account rates could be in decline,” says certified financial planner Bruce Primeau at Summit Wealth Advocates.

According to Bobbi Rebell, certified financial planner and author of Launching Financial Grownups, “a savings account is going to give you the most flexibility and liquidity. You can access your money at any time. But the rate of interest you are paid will generally be lower than a CD and can fluctuate,” she says.

“With a CD, your money will be tied up for a given period of time but the rate is also locked in for that period of time. And while you don’t have as much access, depending on the duration and terms of the CD, you generally have more upside in terms of the return you are getting on your investment,” says Rebell. 

Comparing interest rates of certificates of deposit and savings accounts

As of July 2023, the best CD rates on 5-year terms are around 5%. “They fluctuate with the prevailing interest rates, and because rates have been climbing, the yields on CDs have also been going up. While no one can predict the future, rates are widely expected to remain at their current levels or go up more in the coming months, depending on the Fed’s decisions around interest rate hikes,” says Palmer. 

In July 2023, some of the best savings accounts include SoFi at 4.40%, BMO Alto at 4.75%, Citizens at 4.50% and Wealthfront Cash at 4.55%. You can see some of the best rates CD rates here and some of the best savings rates here.

Traditional savings accounts vs. high yield savings accounts vs. money market accounts

Traditional savings accounts remain a popular place to park cash because they’re liquid, meaning money can be withdrawn any time without incurring a fee. The downside is that they generally pay paltry interest rates compared to high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts.

That said, traditional savings, high-yield savings and money market accounts are all typically FDIC insured up to $250,000 per account, so those concerned about protecting their money should know that all of these accounts typically offer the same level of insurance.

Because high-yield savings accounts are designed to encourage saving, they may offer a limited number of withdrawals or require a minimum balance be met monthly. Money market accounts still offer competitive interest rates and the ability to debit directly from the account, though they’ll likely offer lower interest rates than high-yield savings accounts.

Early withdrawal from CDs: Can you access funds before maturity?

While not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties, many do. “I suggest clients be aware of what those look like and err on the safe side and not tie up monies in CDs if the funds are needed shorter-term,” says Primeau.

Depending on the terms, withdrawal penalties for CDs can be severe. “You will also forfeit a period of interest along with future interest payments,” says Rebell.

One reason CDs pay higher returns is because they do require the saver to commit the money for a period of time. “If the saver reneges and pulls their money out, a penalty for early withdrawal is assessed and typically this involves forfeiting a certain amount of interest, stated up front when you obtained the CD. Depending on the penalty, you may decide it’s worth it in order to invest in a higher yielding CD now available,” says McBride.

That said, brokered CDs — those purchased in a brokerage account — are traded on a secondary market and can be sold before maturity without penalty. It’s still possible that you’ll lose money when selling a CD before it reaches maturity though, depending on interest rates.

Certificate of deposit early withdrawal penalties: Understanding the consequences

When you buy a CD, you’re essentially entering into an agreement for a designated period of time whereby you acknowledge that you won’t access the monies you’ve tied up. Certified financial planner Joe Favorito at Landmark Wealth Management, says that in most cases, the penalty is the interest you would have earned, but not the principal.

“However, you should not buy a CD with the intent of breaking it,” says Favorito. While federal law requires banks to charge a minimum of 7 days’ worth of interest for an early withdrawal, banks can independently decide the maximum amount of the penalty they’d like to implement, which is why it’s imperative to read the fine print before you buy a CD.

Flexible access to funds: Exploring withdrawal options for savings accounts

Savings accounts generally offer flexible access to funds with withdrawals permitted via ATM, over the phone, in person or through an online transfer. 

Because the point of having a savings account is to put money away and save, some banks penalize account holders for exceeding a certain number of withdrawals from a savings account each month, but this varies by bank and often depending on the amount in the savings account.

Depositing funds: Limits and opportunities for certificates of deposit and savings accounts

The short answer here is that there aren’t really limits to how much you can deposit, but because of FDIC or NCUA insurance protections, you may not want to have more than $250,000 in any given account. “A bank will take in as much as you’ll give them, but the FDIC limits (listed below) are what you need to protect yourself,” says Favorito. 

Protecting your finances: FDIC insurance coverage for certificates of deposit and savings accounts

It’s essential to make sure your deposits are at an institution that offers FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage. “Consumers should be reassured that savings accounts and CDs are covered by FDIC [or NCUA] insurance up to $250,000. CDs are as safe as putting money in a savings account, and in most cases will provide a higher return,” says Rebell. Credit unions are protected too, by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which manages the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) that guarantees money in credit union accounts up to $250,000.

Federal deposit insurance provides coverage up to $250,000 per account owner, per ownership category. “If you have a CD and a savings account both held as an individual, your total coverage is $250,000 – not per account. If one account is owned as an individual and your spouse owns the other account, then each will be insured up to the $250,000 limit,” McBride says.

Opening an account: Minimum deposit requirements for CDs and savings accounts

Typically, CDs have a $1,000 minimum purchase size, says certified financial planner Bruce Primeau at Summit Wealth Advocates. It’s not uncommon for minimum balances to range between $500 and $2,500 according to pros, while many online savings accounts have no account minimums. “Some banks have no minimums, but you want to make sure you have enough in your overall bank relationship to avoid having fees assessed on things like checking accounts,” says Favorito.

Shopping around can make a big difference as some of the best-yielding savings accounts and CDs can be had for minimal initial deposits, says McBride.

The impact on credit score: evaluating certificates of deposit and savings accounts

When you open a bank account or a CD, the bank isn’t loaning you money, they’re holding your deposit. For this reason, depositors are not a credit risk. The bank is typically only interested in your credit score when you take out a loan.

Choosing the right path: short-term vs long-term goals

“If you need the money right away, like for the first bucket of an emergency fund, savings is probably best. CDs will most likely pay more if they are funds you most likely won’t access before maturity, avoiding the early withdrawal penalty. Don’t let the penalty scare you too much; many times you are still [monetarily] ahead even with a penalty and with CDs, you know what you will get and when. With savings accounts, that high rate could go away overnight,” says Mark Struthers, certified financial planner at Sona Wealth Advisors.

Another thing to consider is that because of the long-term nature of CDs, consumers run the risk of depositing their money into a CD and then forgetting about it. “If you change addresses or other contact information changes, you always want to be sure to update the financial institution holding your CD so it can contact you. It’s also worth making a note on your calendar so you know when the CD term is ending and you can access your money. Banks have different policies around what happens if they can’t reach you when a CD term is up, so it’s worth checking on how your bank handles that situation,” says Palmer.

For those with long term goals, or retirement funds, investing in stocks can be the most lucrative place to park money. Investors with long time horizons can better weather the market than those with shorter time horizons and investing often yields higher returns in the long run."

And while many banks and credit unions with the most competitive annual percentage yield in September 2024 have already started to  scale back their offers, dozens are still promoting rates well in excess of 5% APY. (You can see some of the highest-paying savings accounts here.)

Why are rates coming down? For one, inflation has continued to decline over the past year — now at levels not seen since 2021. Although it hasn’t reached the central bank’s 2% target, pros largely agree its prolonged downward trend is enough to show the central bank the signs of fiscal improvement needed to ramp up borrowing costs. Nevertheless, plenty of financial institutions are still promising high-yield savings opportunities, with little to no fees, increased liquidity with access to checking accounts and ATM withdrawals.

Yes, there are even higher rates out there, however the very best savings rates often come with exclusive credit union membership requirements, balance restrictions or other hurdles to jump through. That’s why we analyzed “best savings account” reviews from some of the leading financial sites in America — including Forbes Advisor, CNBC Select, CNN Underscored, Bankrate, and more — to determine the most recommended offerings right now. These 10 high-yield savings accounts landed on the most “best of” lists in September 2024:

Methodology for choosing the best high-yield savings accounts

Every month, our team scours the internet for high-yield savings accounts recommendations to bring you the very best of the best. We read “best savings account” reviews from The Ascent/The Motley Fool, Bankrate, Business Insider, CNBC Select, CNN Underscored, CNET, Forbes Advisor, NerdWallet, SmartAsset and Wallethub. We then rank these accounts based on the total number of recommendations. Winners are determined by the number of times they appear on any of these lists. Simply put, banks that appear on the most “best savings account” lists score the highest. 

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
What is a high-yield savings account?

With the proliferation of internet-only banks in the late 1990s, heightened competition to offer the best rates resulted in the phenomena now known as the high-yield savings account. High-yield savings accounts are similar to traditional savings accounts, but they typically offer customers interest rates that are many times higher than the national average. While the typical savings account earns an average annual percent yield (APY) of 0.45%, according to FDIC data through Aug. 19, many high-yield savings accounts currently earn 5% APY or more.

How much can I earn on a high-yield savings account?

Some high-yield savings accounts are now paying 5% or more, though most don’t pay that much. What might a high-yield savings account actually earn you? Let’s say your savings account earns 2% APY. Savers can earn as much as $2,000 per year on $100,000.

How does a high-yield savings account stack up to other similar investment options?

Certificates of deposit: Interest rates for certificates of deposit, or CDs, have reached and even surpassed as much as a 9% APY in some rate cases. While CDs typically have fixed rates, and typically change depending on measures taken by the Federal Reserve, account holders can lock in these rates when they are high to reap the rewards.

Although CDs often come with a higher APY than most high-yield savings accounts, these investment options are set for a certain period of time and tend to come with penalties if withdrawals are made ahead of their respective maturity dates. High-yield savings accounts are generally a more liquid alternative to CDs, since you can make steady deposits and access the money as needed.

Money-market accounts: Money-market accounts generally come with larger minimum balances than typical savings or high-yield accounts. Rates are also slightly higher than a high-yield savings account and are subject to change over time. Another key difference from a high-yield savings account is that money-market accounts allow customers the ability to write checks. 

Index funds: When it comes to holding cash for a short-term period or a near-term horizon, high-yield savings accounts offer relatively set and predictable returns based on their interest rates. If you’re planning on holding your money for a longer-term period, like say for five years or more, you may want to also consider investing your money in an index fund.

These are essentially baskets of securities designed to follow a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, and can deliver sizable long-term gains. While funds like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY, posted an annual gain of 26.19% last year, the index tracker had a loss of 15.21% in 2022, according to Morningstar. That said, the fund has delivered a 5-year gain of 15.20% and 10-year annualized return of 12.65%, as of Sept. 4.

Are high-yield savings accounts safe?

As long as you open an account that is FDIC- or NCUA-insured, your money is typically protected up to $250,000. The government agency known as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or the FDIC, insures up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category, so there is little to no risk of capital loss. The NCUA, or the National Credit Union Administration, is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1971 to insure deposits at federally insured credit unions and members who own credit unions; it insures individual accounts at federally insured credit unions up to $250,000.

In some cases, such as robo advisers for instance, these accounts may offer an even higher rate of protection. Just be sure to read the fine print to ensure your money is safe.

How do I choose the best high-interest savings account?

Choosing a high-yield savings account really depends on what you’re looking for as a saver. Some key factors you may want to consider include interest rates, fees, location and accessibility of your money. The annual percentage yield (APY), which determines how much interest your money will earn while stored in a high-yield savings account can differ depending on the bank you choose to store it with.

Look too at account minimums, deposit requirements and associated fees. There are often bonuses involved if you set up tools like direct deposit or meet various other requirements. Another important factor you may want to consider is whether you want an online-only bank or one that has brick-and-mortar locations.

How often do high-yield savings rates change?

One factor you should be aware of before opening a high-yield savings account is that interest rates are variable. That means they are subject to change depending on any adjustments made to the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the government agency responsible for setting monetary policy for the Federal Reserve."

I’m very nervous about the upcoming election and the prospect of another recession, and the effect on my finances. I’m asking for assistance in thinking about what to do. My investments have done well over time. I fear a storm is coming.

Firstly, I am 72 years old and a widow. I recently inherited a large estate of mid-seven figures. Most of it is in investments, the rest in cash, which is in a trust. I own some real estate, including my home and a duplex that I co-own with a family member. I have no debt. "
