WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) Director Kathleen L. Kraninger made the following statement regarding her second-year anniversary leading the Bureau:

“In these challenging times, I’m proud of the work that the Bureau has undertaken to protect consumers during the pandemic,” said CFPB Director Kraninger. “We have a dedicated workforce that has been focused on carrying out our mission and adapting to the current environment. For example, we have altered the way that we conduct examinations to protect our workforce as they work to protect consumers in the marketplace. We will continue to use all of our tools to prevent consumer harm through education, supervision of financial markets, development of regulation, and enforcement of the law against bad actors.”

In the second year under Director Kraninger’s leadership, the Bureau’s work has included:

Informing Consumers of their options during the pandemic and helping companies focus resources on providing assistance
Launched a federal interagency housing website with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Federal Housing Finance Agency. For consumers who are concerned about how they will pay their mortgage or rent because of the coronavirus, the website is a one-stop-shop to find accurate information about relief options available to them—especially those under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).
Rapidly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by producing a series of tools (more than 70 blogs, web pages, and videos) on pandemic-related consumer education materials, many of which are available in multiple languages.
Created a webpage of pandemic-related resources which is continually updated. Topics covered include mortgages, credit reporting, debt collection, student loans, frauds and scams, and managing your finances.
Since the pandemic began, more than 4 million users accessed the pandemic-specific resources on the web, with another 7.3 million web users accessing the Bureau’s other educational resources in FY20.
Created and implemented a new, targeted supervisory approach, known as Prioritized Assessments, which consists of high-level inquiries designed to obtain information from entities to assess the impacts on consumer financial product markets due to pandemic-related issues.
Provided temporary flexibility to enable financial companies to work with customers in need as they responded to the pandemic by postponing some data collections from companies on Bureau-related rules to allow the companies to focus on responding to consumers in need.
Organized outreach and engagements with all stakeholders and garnered significant and useful feedback on the impact of the pandemic on consumers and financial markets.
The Bureau’s advisory committees held public meetings, including a combined advisory committee meeting via conference call with the Consumer Advisory Board, Community Bank Advisory Council, Credit Union Advisory Council, and Academic Research Council, to discuss the impact of the pandemic on consumers and the financial marketplace, in addition to other topics.
Facilitated numerous virtual engagements with external stakeholders including, most notably, Director speeches at virtual conferences, townhalls, meetings, the Cost-Benefit Analysis symposium, and the advisory committee spring and fall meetings and on-boarded new advisory committee members, as well as similar outreach opportunities that yielded significant feedback and recommendations on the pandemic.
Vigorously enforcing the law against bad actors to help the Bureau reach the second highest number of public enforcement actions in a year
To date in 2020, the Bureau has brought 42 public enforcement actions and is on target to exceed the second highest number of public enforcement actions filed–since the Bureau’s inception–by the end of this year. The filing of several more public enforcement actions by the end of the year is expected.
The Bureau is currently litigating nearly 30 cases—which is also among the largest litigation dockets in its history. Among the Bureau’s current litigations are two very substantial cases involving Ocwen Financial Corporation —one of the leading non-bank mortgage servicers in the country—and Navient Solutions—one of the nation’s largest servicers of federal and private student loans.
The Bureau continues to survey the market in real time to address law violators. Among other things, it reviews its complaint database, meets and coordinates with other state and federal agencies, monitors news reports and legal filings, and reviews whistleblower tips to uncover potential malfeasance.
Under Director Kraninger’s tenure, the Bureau’s public enforcement actions have resulted in orders requiring over $1.45 billion in total consumer relief as well as over $270 million in civil money penalties. To date in 2020, the Bureau’s public enforcement actions have resulted in orders requiring nearly $670 million in total consumer relief and over $90 million in civil money penalties. By the end of the year, additional actions will increase these amounts potentially significantly. This would put the Bureau at near-historic highs of both the number of public enforcement actions and associated recoveries. These actions have also resulted in a wide range of injunctive relief designed to stop unlawful conduct and prevent future violations—including in some instances banning future participation in the market.
In the fair lending arena, the Bureau:
Filed a lawsuit against a company alleging that it engaged in redlining and discouragement.
Issued a consent order against a bank, finding that it reported inaccurate Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.
Has a number of ongoing fair lending investigations and anticipates opening additional investigations.
In actions against banks within our authority, the Bureau:
Filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third National Bank Association for allegedly opening unauthorized deposit and credit-card accounts
Filed a lawsuit against a Citizens Bank, N.A. for allegedly failing to properly manage and respond to consumers’ credit card disputes and fraud claims.
Issued a consent order against T.D. Bank., N.A. regarding its marketing and sale of its optional overdraft service. The order requires it to pay about $97 million in restitution and pay a $25 million civil money penalty.
As part of a sweep to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule, the Bureau:
Filed two additional settlements with two companies and their subsidiaries as part of its sweep of enforcement actions to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule. The consent orders require the companies to pay nearly $2 million in civil money penalties and impose requirements to prevent future violations. One company and its subsidiaries must also pay consumer redress.
As part of a sweep to address violations of the Military Lending Act (MLA), the Bureau:
Filed a lawsuit against LendUp Loans, LLC, an online lender that allegedly violated the MLA by extending loans with an annualized percentage rate that exceeds the MLA’s 36% cap, loans that require borrowers to submit to arbitration, and failing to make certain loan disclosures.
In actions against nonbank market entities within our authority, the Bureau:
Filed a proposed judgment and order against the largest non-bank servicer in the country, Nationstar Mortgage LLC. The Bureau’s action was part of a coordinated effort between the Bureau, a multistate group of state attorneys general, and state bank regulators. The Bureau alleged that Nationstar violated multiple federal consumer financial laws, causing substantial harm to the borrowers whose mortgage loans it serviced, including distressed homeowners. The proposed judgment and order, if entered by the court, would require Nationstar to pay approximately $73 million in redress to more than 40,000 harmed borrowers. It would also require Nationstar to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty to the Bureau.
Issued a consent order against a company, finding that it and its agents engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in its servicing of auto loans. The consent order requires the company to provide up to $1 million of cash redress, credit any outstanding account charges associated with a wrongful repossession, and to pay a civil money penalty of $4 million.
Filed and then settled against a company and its subsidiaries—which together comprise the largest debt collector and debt buyer in the United States. The Bureau alleged that they violated the terms of a prior Bureau consent order and again engaged in unlawful debt collection activities. The settlement requires the and its subsidiaries to pay $79,308.81 in redress to consumers and a $15 million civil money penalty.
In an effort to protect servicemembers, the Bureau:
Engaged in a sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage companies that used deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages, which yielded nine public enforcement actions. Through these nine settlements, the Bureau obtained more than $4.4 million in civil money penalties, and imposed strong requirements to prevent future violations. The consent orders also impose substantial prohibitions and enhanced disclosure requirements that each company must follow.
To protect students, the Bureau:
Filed a proposed stipulated judgment against PEAKS, a group of trusts that owned and managed private loans for students at ITT Technical Institute. The Bureau alleged that PEAKS knew or was reckless in not knowing that many student borrowers did not understand the terms and conditions of those loans and could not afford them, or in some cases, did not even know they had them. If entered by the court, the proposed stipulated judgment would require PEAKS to stop collecting on all outstanding PEAKS loans, discharge all outstanding PEAKS loans, and ask all consumer reporting agencies to which PEAKS furnished information to delete information relating to PEAKS loans. The total amount of loan forgiveness is currently estimated to be $330 million, which will be provided to the approximately 35,000 borrowers with outstanding principal balances on their PEAKS loans.
Is preparing for trial in its lawsuit against Navient Corporation and its subsidiaries, Navient Solutions, Inc., and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. The Bureau has alleged that Navient Solutions and Navient Corporation steered borrowers toward repayment plans that resulted in borrowers paying more than other options; misreported to credit reporting agencies that severely and permanently disabled borrowers who had loans discharged under a federal program had defaulted on the loans when they had not; deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and repeatedly incorrectly applied or misallocated borrower payments to their accounts. The Bureau has also alleged that Pioneer and Navient Corporation misled borrowers about the effect of rehabilitation on their credit reports and the collection fees that would be forgiven in the federal loan rehabilitation program.
In numerous other actions across the markets over which it has enforcement jurisdiction, the Bureau took action to address law violations in connection with various other consumer financial products and services, including action to stop law violations related to auto servicing, student finance, debt collection, debt relief, auto-title lending, credit repair, and high-interest loans to veterans. In doing so, the Bureau partnered with a number of state agencies, including the Arkansas, Massachusetts, and New York attorneys general.
Promoting access to financial products for all consumers
Issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking comments and information to identify opportunities to prevent credit discrimination, encourage responsible innovation, promote fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit, address potential regulatory uncertainty, and develop viable solutions to regulatory compliance challenges under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. Among the topics included in the RFI are how to better protect consumers with limited English proficiency as well as applicants who derive income from any public assistance program.
The Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration issued a joint statement on the use of alternative data in underwriting by banks, credit unions, and non-bank financial firms. The purpose of the statement was to provide guidance on the use of alternative data in underwriting and, to the extent firms are using or contemplating using alternative data, to encourage responsible use of such data.
Continues to meet with and engage organizations representing limited English proficiency consumers to identify concerns they face when seeking financial information in multiple languages. As a result of these engagements, the Bureau produced most of its pandemic education content in multiple languages, including videos and online resources.
Facilitating compliance by providing clear rules of the road through rulemaking
Issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to seek input on how to most efficiently and effectively develop regulations to implement section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which provides for consumer access to financial records. The consumer rights described in section 1033 affect a wide variety of consumer financial products that millions of Americans use regularly. The Bureau also took the first steps toward developing rules to implement Section 1033, ten years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. While issuing an ANPR is an optional step in the rulemaking process, the Bureau is committed to ensuring transparent and deliberate rulemaking processes.
Released its Outline of Proposals Under Consideration and Alternatives Considered for Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act governing small business lending data collection and reporting. The Bureau convened a Small Business Advocacy Review panel in October 2020. The panel will prepare a report that examines the impact of the potential rule on small businesses. The report, along with feedback received from small businesses, will be considered by the Bureau in its rulemaking to implement Section 1071.
Issued a final rule amending its Disclosure of Records and Information Regulation, seeking to balance concerns regarding the Bureau’s need to protect confidential and investigative information against the need to use and disclose certain information in the course of the Bureau’s work or that of other agencies.
The Bureau issued multiple final rules in calendar year 2020 as part of the priority to provide clear rules of the road. The rules included:
Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans
The final rule concerning small dollar lending rescinds the mandatory underwriting provisions of the 2017 rule while maintaining consumer access to credit and competition in the marketplace. The Bureau’s action will help to ensure the continued availability of small dollar lending products for consumers who demand them, including those who may have a particular need for such products as a result of the current pandemic.
Remittance Transfers Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act
The final rule allows certain banks and credit unions to continue to provide estimates of the exchange rate and certain fees under certain conditions. This could preserve consumers’ ability to send remittances from their bank accounts to certain countries or recipient institutions. The final rule will also reduce burden on over 400 banks and almost 250 credit unions that send a relatively small number of remittances.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
The final rule increases the permanent threshold for collecting and reporting data about closed-end mortgage loans and open-end lines of credit. Once effective, the rule will reduce regulatory burden on smaller institutions to help those institutions to focus on responding to consumers in need now and in the longer term.
Debt collection rule to clarify protections Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
The final rule restates and clarifies prohibitions on harassment and abuse, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices by debt collectors when collecting consumer debt. The rule focuses on debt collection communications and gives consumers more control over how often and through what means debt collectors can communicate with them regarding their debts. The rule also clarifies how the protections of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which was passed in 1977, apply to newer communication technologies, such as email, text messages and social media, adding protections for consumers when debt collectors contact them through these technologies.
General Qualified Mortgage (QM)
The final rule replaces the current requirement for General QM loans that the consumer’s debt-to-income ratio (DTI) not exceed 43% with a limit based on the loan’s pricing. In adopting a price-based approach to replace the specific DTI limit for General QM loans, the Bureau determined that a loan’s price is a strong indicator of a consumer’s ability to repay and is a more holistic and flexible measure of a consumer’s ability to repay than DTI alone.
Seasoned QMs
The final rule creates a new category of Seasoned QMs for first-lien, fixed-rate covered transactions that have met certain performance requirements, are held in portfolio by the originating creditor or first purchaser for a 36-month period, comply with general restrictions on product features and points and fees, and meet certain underwriting requirements.
Established Taskforce on Federal Consumer Financial Law on January 9, 2020, which is intended to examine the existing legal and regulatory environment facing consumers and financial services providers. The Taskforce is an independent body within the Bureau and reports to the Director. At the conclusion of its one-year term, the Taskforce will deliver a report of recommendations for ways to improve and strengthen consumer financial laws and regulations to the Director.
Creating a culture of compliance
Institutions paid more than $80 million in restitution in connection with supervisory activities to more than 666,000 consumers in FY 2020. During this same period Supervision issued 457 matters requiring attention to supervised entities setting forth appropriate corrective actions and promoting a culture of compliance; among which include:
In FY 2020 the Bureau started 104 supervisory exams/reviews at supervised entities and completed 140 supervisory exams/reviews at supervised entities.
The Bureau began implementation of a supervisory program to review information technology and IT controls for their impact on compliance with federal consumer financial law.
Published three issues of Supervisory Highlights in FY 2020:
Issue 20: A special edition of Supervisory Highlights covering consumer reporting supervisory observations at furnishers and consumer reporting agencies.
Issue 21: Covering supervisory findings in the areas of debt collection, mortgage servicing, payday lending, and student loan servicing.
Issue 22: Covering supervisory findings in the areas of consumer reporting, debt collection, deposits, fair lending, mortgage servicing, and payday lending.
Implemented a comprehensive policy to permit entities to terminate Bureau consent orders.
Issued a compliance bulletin titled Handling of Information and Documents during Mortgage Servicing Transfers, to provide guidance to residential mortgage servicers regarding the transfer of mortgage loans.
Instituted a post-commissioning specialization program that deepens examiner expertise in fair lending, mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, and coaching/training.
Issued its final Advisory Opinions Policy to publicly address regulatory uncertainty in the Bureau’s existing regulations and provide guidance to entities on outstanding regulatory uncertainty. In addition to the final Policy, the Bureau issued two advisory opinions. The first one regarded earned wage access products to facilitate earlier access to wages at no cost to employees. The second rule clarified requirements for certain education loan products that refinance or consolidate a consumer’s pre-existing loans.
Educating and empowering consumers to make better informed financial decisions
Expanded the Start Small, Save Up initiative to encourage consumers to build emergency savings and increase opportunities for more consumers to save.
Offered training to assist librarians at more than 100 libraries registered to receive information that can help make their libraries a “go-to” financial education resource in the community.
The Bureau’s network of financial education practitioners grew from 8,200 to 21,000, helping improve the connectedness of the financial education field to the Bureau and leveraging financial education practitioners to reach more people with Bureau resources.
The Director was the featured author for a guest post on Sesame Workshop’s website. The post is titled “Helping your child’s money skills grow.” This was an opportunity to highlight the Bureau’s Money as You Grow consumer education resources to help parents and caregivers teach children about basic financial skills.
Launched ready-to-use classroom activities for high/middle/elementary school teachers and more than 50,700 teachers were reached with activities for classroom use. These resources have become critical as the need has increased significantly during the pandemic as parents are home schooling their children and teachers are looking for virtual resources.
Launched a new web tool on paying for college called Your Financial Path to Graduation to help students evaluate financial aid offers and provide action steps to prepare to pay for higher education.
Expanded reach to consumers and those who serve them through the Financial Intuition podcast series that covers financial topics for students and young consumers to manage money, save and pay for college, and repay student debt.
Expanded the Misadventures in Money Management series to include a military family module and produced the Your Money Your Goals Military Companion Guide.
Launched the Elder Fraud Prevention and Response Networks Development Guide, an online resource to help communities form networks to increase their capacity to prevent and respond to elder financial abuse. The guide offers planning tools, templates, and exercises to help communities create a collaborative network to fight elder fraud or refresh or expand an existing network.
Educated more than 6,000 aging services, financial institution, law enforcement, and other professionals about the value of, and resources for, elder fraud prevention and response networks.
Educated more than 5,000 aging services professionals about fiduciary roles and resources for consumers through the Managing Someone Else’s Money guides.
As part of the Your Money Your Goals (YMYG) Program, the Bureau facilitated training of more than 4,400 staff in intermediary organizations who work directly with lower-income consumers, providing information and action steps in money management that can be shared with the people they serve. Survey findings showed that 90% more staff felt highly confident in their ability to support clients on finances. Additionally, more than 380,000 YMYG consumer-facing print publications were ordered by the public.
Drawing from its credit research and consumer education programs, the Bureau worked with six urban and rural communities to help consumers build a positive credit history and protect their credit when facing financial challenges.
Reached diverse coalitions across the country during various town halls and roundtables including the Director at the National Diversity Coalition’s town hall and virtual coffee break, which were attended by hundreds of diverse community and industry leaders.
Informing the Bureau’s work through the use of research
In its most productive period to date for publishing research, the Bureau released reports on a variety of topics, most notably two special issue Data Points regarding the effects of the pandemic on consumer financial markets. The Bureau’s reports and publications were cited in over 200 publications. Among the research includes:
Market Snapshot: Background Screening Reports
Data Point: Servicer Size in the Mortgage Market
Data Point: Borrower Experiences on Income Driven Repayment

Receiving consumer complaints, sharing information with interagency partners, and taking action as appropriate
Handled record complaint volume in calendar year 2020, despite the changes in operations brought by the pandemic and stay-at-home orders.
Fielded more than 500,000 complaints through December 2020 compared to 332,000 in the same period in 2019, an overall increase of approximately 51%.
Received its 2.5 millionth consumer complaint in October 2020.
Supported more than 5,800 companies responding to complaints, answering more than 2,500 questions from company users and their trade associations, responding within an average of 0.4 days.
Launched the Borrower Protection Program, a new joint initiative with the FHFA that includes making Bureau complaint information and future analytical tools available to FHFA via a secure electronic interface.
The Bureau and the Department of Education signed a new memorandum (MOU) of understanding to share complaint information from borrowers and meet quarterly to discuss observations about the nature of complaints received, characteristics of borrowers, and available information about resolution of complaints. The MOU also provides for the sharing of complaint data analysis, recommendations, and analytical tools.
The Bureau released its yearly report analyzing student loan complaints submitted by consumers from September 1, 2019, through August 31, 2020.
Promoting innovation to support consumers
Granted seven applications in 2020 under its innovations policies announce in 2019.
Issued two No Action Letter (NAL) templates under its innovation policies to provide increased regulatory certainty. Using the first template, mortgage servicers seeking to assist struggling borrowers to avoid foreclosure and engage in loss mitigation efforts would be able to apply for their own NAL. To further competition in the small-dollar lending space and facilitate robust competition that fosters access to credit, the Bureau also approved a second template that insured depository institutions can use to apply for a NAL covering their small-dollar credit products. The templates include important protections for consumers who seek small-dollar loan products.
Hosted its first Tech Sprint to improve consumer disclosures. The hackathon-style event generated innovations to improve adverse action notices issued pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Thirteen teams, made up of those in industry, advocacy, academia, and other fields, developed and demonstrated new disclosures, modeling methods, and other improvements that have the potential to make disclosures more fair, informative, or accurate. This was the first Tech Sprint hosted by a federal financial regulator.
Hosted the first joint innovation office hours with the Utah Attorney General, the Colorado Attorney General, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the American Consumer Financial Innovation Network (ACFIN), which now has 21 members. The Bureau founded ACFIN to increase coordination between state and federal regulators on the topic of consumer financial innovation. Office hours, and ACFIN’s growing membership, demonstrate the broad coalition of regulators devoted to furthering innovation that the Bureau has assembled.
Enhanced inter-agency coordination
Worked collaboratively with other Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) member agencies to respond to challenges posed to consumers by the pandemic including the issuance of guidance to financial institutions on prudent risk management and consumer protection principles for financial institutions to consider while working with borrowers as initial pandemic-related loan accommodation periods end.
Worked in partnership with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to help the estimated 9 million non-filers collect their Economic Impact Payments (EIP). The Bureau created and widely distributed a guide to assist the intermediaries who work with and council this hard-to-reach population.
Hosted three Director-level listening sessions with direct service providers and civil rights leaders to hear about the experiences of economically vulnerable consumers in April and May 2020 affected by the pandemic and worked to better assist struggling homeowners with their CARES Act protections, and led multiple interagency discussions including with IRS and Treasury staff about the Bureau’s outreach plan and strategies to amplify on the EIP effort.
Hosted a student loan symposium with Federal Student Aid’s student loan ombudsman, the Conference of State Banking Supervisors, a national consumer advocacy group and an industry trade association.
Promoting a more inclusive, effective and efficient organization
Built a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our workforce consists of 50% women and 41% Minority employees. The Bureau’s leadership team is 49% women and 36% minorities.
Launched the Mentoring for Success program to enhance professional development. It includes: 35 matched mentor/protégé pairs that meet regularly; a leadership speaker series; and group discussions on career development topics.
The Bureau’s mission is best accomplished with a diverse and inclusive workforce which reflects the nation’s diversity. The Bureau continues to promote diversity and inclusion by promoting comprehensive diversity and inclusion trainings and dialogues.
Participated in High School Scholar Internship Program (HSSIP). The Bureau partnered with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the District of Columbia government’s Department of Employment Services (DOES) and the Marion S.

The interns were exposure to careers in public service, particularly in the field of consumer financial protection.
Completed the renovation and relocation of all Washington, DC-based staff from two office buildings into one to increase the effectiveness of the organization and to significantly improve the collaboration across all teams and divisions.
Completed the buildout and relocation of staff into the Bureau’s Southeast Regional office in Atlanta, Georgia, allowing the Bureau to collaborate more effectively with other partner financial regulators who also have their offices in the region.
Implemented several changes to the procurement process to increase opportunities for women and minority owned businesses. These included: Conducting vendor outreach sessions geared toward the women and minority owned business community; inserting a good faith effort contract clause in all of its solicitations and awards to ensure vendors’ workforces are diverse; and, incorporating a new clause for all new solicitations and contract awards requiring vendors to make a good faith effort to promote and ensure inclusion of historically Black colleges and universities and minority institutions for subcontracts.
Improved its decision-making and resource allocation processes by maturing our enterprise risk management (ERM) capabilities.

Prepared Remarks by Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Consumer Bankers Association
Austin, Texas
March 21, 2012

Thank you, Consumer Bankers Association, for inviting me to speak with you today. And thank you for your willingness to work with us and give us valuable insight over the past year.

In March of 1962, President John F. Kennedy delivered a speech to Congress on protecting the interests of the consumer. He said that government needs to meet its responsibility to consumers in the exercise of their rights. These rights include: the right to safety; the right to be informed; the right to choose; and the right to be heard.

At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau we stand by President Kennedy’s statements from a half-century ago. They continue to define broad principles of responsibility that a government owes to its citizens. We believe those protections are particularly appropriate when it comes to consumer financial products and services.

In that same speech, President Kennedy said, “Excessive and untimely use of credit arising out of ignorance of its true cost is harmful both to the stability of the economy and to the welfare of the public.” Unfortunately, President Kennedy was also right about that. We learned that lesson again, the hard way, when the recent financial crisis hit our country so hard, undermining both the stability of the economy and the welfare of the public in ways that we continue to grapple with as we seek to move forward.

While there is no doubt that the financial crisis occurred because the financial system failed the American people, we also recognize that the regulatory system failed – that the vision of a government watching out for the consumer failed. This is a key reason why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created. We are here to provide evenhanded oversight that will renew trust in the financial marketplace. We want American consumers to feel confident and positive about the household credit products they use – whether it is their mortgage, student loan, or checking account. We want those products to help people achieve their aspirations and climb the ladder to opportunity and financial security. And we want those businesses that provide responsible financial products or services to American consumers to earn honest, respectable profits for all of their hard work and for their excellent customer service.

Our new role in the regulatory landscape is to create a marketplace for consumer finance that is stronger and more resilient so that honest businesses can succeed. I would like to talk to you today about how we are doing this by promoting transparency, lowering consumer risks, and ensuring a level playing field between banks and their non-bank competitors.

Any good financial business should be highly transparent with its customers. After all, markets work best when consumers have all the information they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families, and are able to choose among highly competitive alternatives. When information is obscured or pricing is too complex to be easily understood, the barriers to consumer comprehension create obstacles to effective competition. Clarity about the choices available makes markets work better.

So we can take from that certain general principles. No one should hide fees. No one should pull bait-and-switch schemes on customers – the products advertised should be the products delivered. No one should advertise high loan amounts or low interest rates when few people actually qualify for such terms. And no one should be writing jargon-laden, difficult-to-read disclosure documents that confuse consumers rather than inform them.

Through the data and experience we are developing at the Consumer Bureau, we have seen that consumers need better information about the costs and risks of borrowing. They need to be able to make comparisons so they can shop around for a good deal. They also need the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the deal they were promised is the deal they are actually getting, not just tomorrow, but next month and next year as well.

We have already been hard at work developing better disclosures for consumers – disclosures that are more strategically effective at helping consumers identify key terms and make useful comparisons. Because people have a hard time understanding the terms of a deal when they have to pore over reams of fine print, we launched our Know Before You Owe campaign to provide consumers with easy-to-understand disclosures that make clearer the prices and risks of financial products up front.

We started our Know Before You Owe campaign by tackling the good faith estimate you get when you apply for a home loan. Then, together with the Department of Education, we released a “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet” that makes it easier to compare aid and loan packages and to understand the payments students will be facing after graduation. We also released a sample credit card agreement that is short and written in plain language to explain the key prices and terms in a manner that is more accessible to consumers.

We strongly believe that financial institutions can and should speak to their customers in terms that are simple and clear. This kind of straightforward transparency promotes more informed and more responsible decision-making by consumers across a number of financial markets.

Again, two basic premises of a well-functioning market are: first, that buyers and sellers understand the terms of the deal, and second, that buyers are able to compare possible alternatives. Honest businesses want to compete in such a market, and they are satisfied to win market share based on fair competition and excellent customer service, not through deception or fraud. It is the American way for responsible businesses to be straightforward and upfront with their customers, giving them all the information they need to make informed decisions. This is good for the honest businesses themselves and it is good for the overall economy.

At the Consumer Bureau, we are also working to lower the risks that consumers face in the financial marketplace. And we are doing our part to provide the mortgage market with clear rules of the road that will help it to revive, serve consumers as it should, and avoid the kinds of destabilizing events that caused the financial crisis which wrecked our economy.

In most lending markets, lenders have an incentive to care about a borrower’s ability to repay – after all, they quite reasonably want to get their money back. But almost everyone involved in the mortgage market leading up to the crisis – mortgage brokers, lenders, appraisers, investment bankers, and even rating agencies – earned up-front rewards that were insufficiently related to the performance of loans over the long run. In mortgages, unlike in credit cards, it was even possible for a loan originator to sell all of the credit risk. You could sell it all. For cash. Well before anyone could know the loan’s ultimate performance. Under conditions like that, it is no wonder that mortgage originators chased risks like never before. And when those risks were exposed and borrowers began defaulting, the whole house of cards came tumbling down.

Consumers had taken on risks they did not recognize or could not understand. Sometimes they were misled. Other times they made some very bad decisions. The ultimate results were terrible for consumers, for businesses, and for the overall economy.

Many of these consumers are now struggling with the consequences of these problems and they will continue to do so for years to come. In the wake of the financial crisis, more than 30 million Americans are now being pursued by debt collectors. Many are experiencing such severe credit problems that they are paying very high interest rates or even are barred from borrowing money at all. Some find that they are having trouble getting a job because when potential employers do a check of their credit history, the problems that show up are blocking them from being hired.

With the stakes so high, consumers deserve to have someone who will stand on their side, protect them against fraud, and ensure they are treated fairly in the financial marketplace. The Consumer Bureau will do that, and if we are able to do our job well, then the benefits will be widely felt. Lowering consumer risks helps firm up the stability of the entire financial marketplace. It also will help restore all-important public confidence in the financial system.

The Consumer Bureau is also working to create a stronger and more resilient marketplace by ensuring a level playing field between banks and their non-bank competitors. This aspect of our work is extremely important for you and your colleagues.

In the years before the crisis, the financial system outgrew the consumer protections that were put in place. The rules fell behind the pace of product changes in the marketplace. And a shadow market for consumer financial services emerged and expanded outside the supervisory framework that encompassed traditional banks, credit unions, and thrifts. Our aim is to change that by providing evenhanded oversight of all competitors regardless of their charter status. We are working to prevent another race to the bottom in consumer financial markets, which came significantly at your expense as you lost market share to those who were not held to the same standards or principles of legal compliance.

This is a key premise of the new consumer financial protection law. We now have the ability to examine participants in both the bank and non-bank segments of the mortgage market, the private student loan market, and the market for low-dollar, short-term loans. This represents a huge transformation. Before the crisis hit, for example, only part of the multi-trillion-dollar mortgage market was subject to federal oversight. Bad practices drove out the good, and the whole economy eventually collapsed, harming many innocent people in the process.

We also have the ability to propose rules that will authorize us to supervise and examine the larger participants in other consumer financial markets. We recently proposed a rule to include debt collectors and credit reporting agencies in our non-bank supervision program. After we receive feedback from all segments of the public on this proposal, we will consider how best to go ahead and finalize the rule.

Over the next year, the Bureau will also be implementing new mortgage standards that Congress adopted in the Dodd-Frank Act. One of our most important rulemakings will implement a new statutory requirement that lenders must make a good faith and reasonable determination that a borrower can repay the mortgage. Other rules about mortgage origination include statutory standards for loan originator compensation and the origination of high-priced mortgages. These rules will apply to all participants in the mortgage markets, again without regard to charter status.

So we believe it is very important for the stability of the market and the well-being of consumers to ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules, including your non-bank competitors. In order to do that, we need your help. We need to hear from you about what you see going on in the marketplace. Where do you see corners being cut? Where do you see standards being bent or stretched? Where do you see the law being violated? We have learned from the recent crisis that we need evenhanded oversight to make the marketplace work. If the cheaters are not allowed to prosper, then the honest businesses will regain their natural advantage.

So a critical element of leveling the playing field means introducing reasonable and evenhanded oversight across all segments of the market, and more importantly, to deter fraud and abuse that undercuts your position in the financial marketplace. When we see that federal consumer financial protection laws are being violated, we will not hesitate to take action to rectify the wrong that is being done. We will remain focused on the fact that in doing this work we are not only protecting consumers, but we are also supporting all those who treat consumers well.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there is much work to be done and much care is needed as we institute essential reforms. Many have remarked upon the novel premise of the new law that regulation of financial institutions from the standpoint of consumer protection is distinguished from regulation of the same institutions from the standpoint of safety and soundness. We think the two vantage points go hand in hand. No institution can be safe and sound if it does not treat its customer base in a manner that is sustainable over the long term.

Our mission at the Consumer Bureau is fundamentally designed to improve the markets for consumer financial products and services. If we are able to do our job well, we will not only improve life for consumers, but we will enable them to regain their trust in the banking system once again. We want to see a consumer financial marketplace based on responsible practices, sound innovation, and excellent customer service. We want to see a solid foundation for establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships. And I frankly believe that you want and should want exactly the same things.

To return again to President Kennedy’s seminal speech about consumer rights, he observed that a better system “can yield rich dividends in strengthening our free competitive economy… and our traditionally high ethical patterns of business conduct. Fair competition aids both business and consumer.” We can all agree on the truth of that observation, and it means that we have common ground to build upon as we find ways to work together.

Thank you.

By Patrice Alexander Ficklin and Paul Watkins – AUG 06, 2019
SHARE & PRINT

For some consumers, the use of unconventional sources of information, or “alternative data,” to evaluate creditworthiness may be a way to increase access to credit or decrease the cost of credit. Alternative data includes information not typically found in core credit files of nationwide consumer reporting agencies and may indicate a likelihood of meeting obligations on time that a traditional credit history may not reflect. 

In addition to the use of alternative data, increased computing power and the expanded use of machine learning can potentially identify relationships not otherwise discoverable through methods that have been traditionally used in credit scoring.  As a result of these innovations, some consumers who now cannot obtain favorably priced credit may see increased credit access or lower borrowing costs.  

Bureau initiatives

In 2017, the Bureau issued a Request for Information Regarding Use of Alternative Data and Modeling Techniques in the Credit Process (RFI) . The RFI noted that while the use of alternative data and models has significant potential benefits for consumers, it also presents certain significant potential risks.  Commenters provided RFI responses about a range of topics, including current uses of alternative data, potential positive and negative consequences associated with its use, and the application of specific statutes and regulations.  The RFI also indicated that the Bureau would begin to consider future activity to encourage responsible use of alternative data and lower unnecessary barriers impeding its use.


Later in 2017, the Bureau announced a No-Action Letter to Upstart Network, Inc . (the “NAL Recipient”), a company that uses alternative data and machine learning in making credit underwriting and pricing decisions. The NAL Recipient’s underwriting model uses traditional underwriting data and various categories of alternative data, including information related to borrowers’ education and employment history. The No-Action Letter references the application of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation B, to the NAL Recipient’s use of alternative data and machine learning for its underwriting and pricing model. This No-Action Letter is specific to the facts and circumstances of the NAL Recipient and does not serve as an endorsement of the use of any particular variables or modeling techniques in credit underwriting and pricing. In addition, neither the No-Action Letter nor this blog post serve as an endorsement of the NAL Recipient or the products or services it offers.

As a condition for receiving its No-Action Letter, the NAL Recipient agreed to a model risk management and compliance plan that requires it to analyze and appropriately address risks to consumers, as well as assess the real-world impact of alternative data and machine learning.  Pursuant to the No-Action Letter, the NAL Recipient provides the Bureau with information comparing outcomes from its underwriting and pricing model (tested model) against outcomes from a hypothetical model that uses traditional application and credit file variables and does not employ machine learning (traditional model). The NAL Recipient independently validated the traditional model through fair lending testing to ensure that it did not violate antidiscrimination laws. Over the last 22 months, the NAL Recipient worked to answer several key questions, including:


Access to credit: whether the tested model’s use of alternative data and machine learning expands access to credit, including lower-priced credit, overall and for various applicant segments, compared to the traditional model
Fair lending: whether the tested model’s underwriting or pricing outcomes result in greater disparities than the traditional model with respect to race, ethnicity, sex, or age, and if so, whether applicants in different protected class groups with similar model-predicted default risk actually default at the same rate

The NAL Recipient has agreed to allow the Bureau to share key highlights from simulations and analyses that it conducted pursuant to its model risk management and compliance plan; the simulations and analyses were not separately replicated by the Bureau.  The following results provided by the NAL Recipient reflect the net effect of both the alternative data and the machine learning methodology used in the lender’s model as applied to the lender’s applicant pool.

The results provided from the access-to-credit comparisons show that the tested model approves 27% more applicants than the traditional model, and yields 16% lower average APRs for approved loans. 

This reported expansion of credit access reflected in the results provided occurs across all tested race, ethnicity, and sex segments resulting in the tested model increasing acceptance rates by 23-29% and decreasing average APRs by 15-17%. 

In many consumer segments, the results provided show that the tested model significantly expands access to credit compared to the traditional model.  In particular, under the tested model, the results provided reflect that:

""Near prime"" consumers with FICO scores from 620 to 660 are approved approximately twice as frequently. 
Applicants under 25 years of age are 32% more likely to be approved.
Consumers with incomes under $50,000 are 13% more likely to be approved.

With regard to fair lending testing, which compared the tested model with the traditional model, the approval rate and APR analysis results provided for minority, female, and 62 and older applicants show no disparities that require further fair lending analysis under the compliance plan.  


Looking ahead

For those concerned about access to affordable credit, more work remains to be done.  The Bureau estimates that 26 million Americans are credit invisible, meaning they have no credit history with a nationwide consumer reporting agency.  Another estimated 19 million consumers have a credit history that has gone stale, or is insufficient to produce a credit score under most scoring models.  Without a sufficient credit history, consumers face barriers to accessing credit, or pay more for credit.  

The Bureau encourages lenders to develop innovative means of increasing fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit, particularly for credit invisibles and those whose credit history or lack thereof limits their credit access or increases their cost of credit, while maintaining a compliance management program that appropriately identifies and addresses risks of legal violations.  Effective compliance management, as well as fair lending analysis results, may vary depending on a number of factors including the applicant pool and the lender’s specific use of data and models. 


 The Bureau remains committed to using all of the tools at its disposal under the Dodd-Frank Act to help address these important issues around access to credit.  Toward that goal, the Bureau is currently reviewing comments to its proposed No-Action Letter, Trial Disclosure, and Product Sandbox policies.

First of all, I thank Uncle Allan Madden for that warm welcome to country on my very first visit to Australia. On behalf of all my colleagues, allow me to pay my respects to the traditional owners of these lands. Also, my thanks to Alan Kirkland for his thoughtful introduction and to all of you for making me feel so much at home. Over the years, I have spoken to many groups where we would debate who deserved the credit for having traveled the farthest to be present. Never before have I been more certain of my qualifications to claim that particular prize!

It is encouraging to be here with so many people who share similar goals and ideals for our global society. I am honored to be chosen to deliver the Ruby Hutchison Memorial lecture. In meetings over the past few days, you have shed much light on our common challenges and aspirations. I have also had the occasion to learn more about our namesake here today and her deep commitment to basic fairness for all consumers. The historical arc of our countries may be different, the evolution of our societies may be different, the structure of our economies may be different, but one strong thread ties us all together. That thread is the difficult, important, and humbling mission of establishing a financial marketplace that is responsible and sustainable for individual consumers, people who have come to depend on credit and other financial services to create opportunities for themselves and their families.

As a single mother of seven children, Ruby Hutchison was well aware of how vulnerable people can be to fraud and exploitation. In an era when formal consumer protections hardly existed, she was determined to inform consumers about their rights. She also found new and innovative ways to strengthen those rights. Her determination to tell people about products, their value, and their safety led to the birth of CHOICE magazine in April 1960.

At around the same time, these issues were beginning to receive more attention in the United States also. In March of 1962, John F. Kennedy addressed the Congress on the subject of identifying and protecting the common interest people share as consumers of goods and services. In discussing a Consumer Bill of Rights, President Kennedy spoke of Americans but could just as easily have been speaking of Australians or any other group of people around the world when he observed that consumers, “by definition, include us all. They are the largest economic group in the economy, affecting and affected by almost every public and private economic decision. Two-thirds of all spending in the economy is by consumers. But they are the only important group in the economy who are not effectively organized, whose views are often not heard.” It is this Presidential address that we now commemorate by our annual celebration of World Consumer Rights Day.

As the years unfold, the time may come when we have our own chance to wade into the currents of history. In my case, I have come to serve as the first Director of the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau was created by our Congress in the wake of the global financial crisis. Before that, the authority to administer and enforce various federal consumer financial laws was scattered across seven federal agencies. For each of these agencies, consumer financial protection was only one of its various responsibilities. Consequently, no single agency was primarily focused on protecting the everyday users of financial products and services – and consumers paid the price when the financial crisis hit us all so hard.

All of that changed with the advent of the Consumer Bureau. We are now the only agency in the United States government with the sole mission of protecting people in the consumer financial marketplace. The rules we write apply to all providers of consumer financial services. We also have the authority to supervise and enforce those rules, and the governing laws, with respect to the largest banks as well as nonbank financial firms such as mortgage lenders, payday lenders, and others.

The most important financial transactions in people’s lives come within our province. Whether it is to pay their bills or finance larger investments in their futures, most people now use credit to help manage their affairs. Credit cards give us quick access to money when we need it. Student loans help us obtain a post-secondary education. Mortgages make it possible to buy a home and spread the payments over many years. In all of these areas and more, the Consumer Bureau was established to stand on the side of consumers and ensure they are treated fairly. Since we opened our doors less than four years ago, we have been intent on making consumer financial markets work better and helping people improve their financial lives.

***

With the provision of financial products and services, as with many things in life, it takes two to tango. Every such transaction involves both a financial provider and a consumer. If we want to raise the standard for how these financial markets actually work, it behooves us to consider what we may be able to do to foster improved behavior on both sides of the table. We need to focus on what we can do to incentivize financial providers to engage in sounder lending and more responsible conduct. We also need to consider how we can help individuals obtain and build the skills to make sustainable choices that serve their own life goals.

In thinking about these issues, I will be making an effort to respond directly to two suggestions you raised for my consideration in your invitation to deliver this speech. One suggestion was to talk about whether regulators can change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center. The other suggestion was to discuss the issue of communication with consumers, including financial literacy, rights, and protections.

***

Before turning to those matters, however, it seems important to establish some perspective on the role of regulation at the outset. Certainly part of the job here is to discern risks to consumers and protect them by minimizing those risks. But then we run pretty quickly up against the tendency in any human organization to err on the side of seeking disproportionately to eliminate risk altogether, even at the expense of the objectives that are served by the underlying activity. We see this tendency in the sporting world in teams that play not to lose rather than play to win. We see it in legal calculations that tend to elevate the safety of inaction over even the most minimal perils of action. And we see it in the regulatory world in an overcautious emphasis to maintain the status quo rather than allow for dynamic change that brings new uncertainties but is itself the essence of progress.

This is a natural human tendency, but it would be misguided here. It reflects an instinctive view of regulation as a defensive and negative enterprise, as a pinched and crabbed attempt to smother the underlying vitality of market participants seeking to fulfill their own ends. It can generate an orientation that is anti-market and even, in various ways, anti-consumer. I have noticed a deep but somewhat understandable skepticism about the regulatory mindset – a belief that it is bound to be paternalistic, seeking to prescribe all the decisions that individuals should be at liberty to make for themselves. That mindset would be destructive of human freedom, of human ingenuity and initiative. It would disserve our mission, and it is most emphatically not the view held by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Instead, we regard ourselves as pro-market and pro-consumer. We want consumers to thrive. And therefore we want responsible financial providers to be able to thrive also by serving them well. So we begin from the basic premise that there is no reason for anyone – least of all those charged with protecting consumers – to decry the structure of the free-market economy in the abstract. Adam Smith taught us how the invisible hand can lead firms to serve the interests of their customers. These customers, as he also taught us, are those who choose to give their “custom” – meaning their customary business not only now, but for the foreseeable future – to those firms best able to satisfy their particular demands. To adapt a phrase from a populist American politician from the era of our Great Depression – ironic in that he was a vehement critic of capitalism – the smooth operation of the free market can succeed in creating a system in which “Everyone is a king, but no one wears a crown.”

If you are initially inclined to doubt this, take a moment and think about what capitalism has meant over the past century for the average person in our so-called “Western” economies. The cost of many products has fallen significantly over time, and the sophistication of machinery and technology now available to each of us would be utterly astonishing to our forebears. For a short list, think of washing machines, clothes dryers, indoor plumbing, heating and cooling systems, stoves and ovens, automobiles, radio and television, personal computers, cellular telephones, tablets, music players, and a list that goes on for quite a while. This is not to say that everything in our economy does operate smoothly – we are too familiar with stubborn poverty and still too close to the global financial crisis to believe that – but in the grand scheme of things, one group that has surely benefited over this lengthy period of history has been the broad consumer public.

By the same token, innovation and progress in the financial realm have had similar effects on the general population. Credit that was virtually non-existent a hundred years ago is widespread today. And credit means opportunity. This is a very important truth to bear in mind here. Credit entails risk, no doubt, and risk can lead to nasty results, but risk also promises reward and hence credit gives us something to work with – something that may allow us to make more of our lives tomorrow than we have yet attained today. It may allow for investments such as the purchase of a home or a car. It may allow for investments in human capital – loans for education or job training, for example. It may give us some limited ability to make purchases to meet our needs today with money we do not expect will come until later. The ability to time-shift the ways and means of our lives creates more convenience and flexibility in our daily affairs, all of which is beneficial for the average person. And as for specific financial products, think of checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, debit cards, ATM machines, credit reporting, mortgage loans, car loans, on-line bill pay, direct deposit, money transfers, and on and on. In the financial realm, also, a major beneficiary of all this progress has been the ordinary consumer.

So consumers can exert substantial power, both individually and collectively, within a well-functioning free-market economy. People can be their own best consumer protectors as long as the market operates properly, without undue obstacles to their primary position as individual decision-makers who have what they need to make informed decisions. But we also know that ideal world may not reflect our common experience, and we must strive toward its attainment.

With that context in mind, we can return to our two central questions: First, how can regulators change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center? Second, how can regulators (or others) help build financial capability by communicating effectively about financial literacy and protections so consumers can be in the best position to look out for their own interests? What follows is a progress report on how we are treating each of these issues in the work we are doing at the Consumer Bureau. No doubt there are other and better ideas people may have, either now or over time, about how to pursue these objectives. And let me be the first to say that we are all ears, always, to hear people’s thoughts about different and more effective approaches. I am not aware of any playbook that sets the rules for how we can optimally perform these tasks. But we have begun to settle into our work, and certain strategies and themes are beginning to emerge from our experiences thus far. So I appreciate your patience as I bend your ear for a bit.

***

Changing the culture of financial service providers – or any for-profit business enterprises – is a tall order. In a free-market economy, the culture revolves around making money; and in an economy built around competing firms, the companies operate on behalf of their owners, which are the shareholders who own their corporate stock. The incentives here are strong and compelling. They are governed by a legal regime that creates a duty to maximize shareholder value and they are driven by the innate self-interest that motivates most human behavior.

But free markets are not simply untrammeled hubbubs of chaotic human activity. Despite what we may seem to see on any trading floor, anarchy in the marketplace has never worked and never will work. On the contrary, in more developed economies our markets operate within the broad confines of legal principle backed by legal compulsion. If someone violates a contract, they can be sued to restore or repair the mutual obligations they had agreed upon. If someone seizes the property of another, the law is available to decide whether they have acted wrongfully and, if so, to make them surrender what they have unjustly appropriated for themselves. Even in a bare-bones “night watchman” state posited by a few theorists, free markets rest on the effective regulation of law and order imposed, at a minimum, by the common law and the criminal law.

For about the last century in America, and increasingly in many of the world’s more developed market economies, this skeletal outline has been filled in more completely by the additional apparatus of formal government regulation. In the United States, a number of government agencies – including the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – play a role in ensuring that free markets also operate fairly, and that some of the disequilibria generated by no-holds-barred capitalism can be smoothed out to some degree. As we saw with the meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market that played such a large role in the global financial crisis, any significant economic disequilibrium can create destructive externalities in the broader economy – in this case, massive job losses, widespread home foreclosures, and crushing reductions in retirement savings within the American economy and great instability transmitted to the world economy.

As we also have seen, though the economy inevitably seeks to return to some market-clearing equilibrium over time, the period of dislocation can be substantial. We are now at six-and-a-half consecutive years of unprecedented levels of near-zero real interest rates in the U.S. economy, for instance, which is rivaling the length of the Great Depression in its severity. As Lord Keynes once ruefully noted about the classical economists and their tidy equilibrium models, “in the long run, we are all dead.” The existence of such real-world flaws undermines the neat graphs of the classical economic models and gives us reason to consider more substantive regulatory interventions that may help safeguard the smooth functioning of economic markets.

In short, not all dynamics of the market economy are driven by what is best for consumers – other influences are at work upon corporate behavior as well. And if we focus most narrowly on what drives profit and innovation for providers, we must recognize that the long-term interest of the consumer public is not always compatible with the behavior we see in the short run. In various market situations, the long-term interests of consumers and the short-run interests of providers can turn out to be oppositional, and much corporate ingenuity is channeled into various schemes to collect rents and exploit superior market positions. It was Adam Smith, after all, who observed that “people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.” Notably, some economic innovations can harm consumers even as they may seem to benefit providers, at least for a time. Exotic mortgage products of the last decade, for instance, were innovations that visited devastating harm on many borrowers – wiping out their savings, ruining their credit, and driving them into foreclosure and economic instability. Yet these products and the shoddy underwriting that accompanied them were widely pursued and maintained for years, despite the risks that were apparent on their face.

So if our free-market economy is not always marked by happy levels of equilibrium that maximize consumer welfare, what kinds of influences may complicate the scene? In addition to pressure from consumers, providers can be affected by other market actors – including competitors, suppliers, shareholders, and employees. They also can be buffeted by pressures external to a particular market, such as exogenous shocks.

One area that deserves our attention is the effect of the law that regulates economic conduct. That body of law can emanate from many sources – including legislators, judges, and various types of executive officials – and it can oscillate over time, even rather unpredictably. Depending on how these influences play out, there can be many obstacles to economic markets mechanically promoting the best interests of consumers. Accordingly, there can be opportunities to correct for market failures, imbalances, and distortions that are harmful to consumers.

But just how are we to unpack all of this? And how should we, as regulators, go about trying to change the culture of financial service providers to focus them on the interests of consumers in face of the numerous pressures that may lead them to do otherwise? Those are hard questions, especially in light of the humbling realization that the regulators are human beings themselves who lack omniscience. But we have one key point as our compass, which is to put the voice of the consumer at the heart of our mission and make it the center of attention for financial providers as well. So let me talk about four things we are doing to accomplish this goal.

***

If our work is to be guided by the voice of the consumer, we must first take pains to hear that voice. We do this most squarely through our consumer response function. Congress required this new agency to establish a system for collecting, investigating, and responding to consumer complaints. In carrying out this duty, we have created the opportunity to hear directly from consumers what is on their minds and what challenges and concerns they are facing in their everyday lives as they seek to navigate the consumer financial marketplace.

The project here is powerfully motivated by the economic self-interest of consumers themselves, who hope that by submitting a complaint they can achieve a resolution and perhaps redress of their grievance. Once a consumer submits a complaint to the Bureau, we forward it via a secure web portal to the appropriate company, which reviews the information, communicates with the consumer as needed, and determines what action to take in response. The company reports back to us and to the consumer on strict time frames. We then invite the consumer to review the response and provide feedback. We review the feedback, using this information along with any other information we may have to prioritize complaints for investigation.

Behind each complaint lie the troubles of real people, the people behind the data. They bring to life the true impact that consumer financial markets can have on individual lives and families. To date, the Bureau has fielded over 550,000 complaints about a wide range of products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, student loans, auto loans, bank accounts and services, credit reporting, debt collection, payday loans, money transfers, prepaid cards, and other consumer loans.

Through this process alone, the Bureau has helped consumers secure millions of dollars in monetary relief and further satisfaction in the form of non-monetary relief, such as cleaning up their credit reports or fending off errant or harassing debt collectors, which can have ripple effects on people’s financial well-being as well as their peace of mind. Moreover, specific complaints sometimes help us target consumers for timely and focused advice about how they might go about understanding and addressing those issues on their own.

As we analyze and aggregate complaints in different ways, they become more than just an issue for the particular consumer. Evaluating the broader pattern of complaints enables us to identify potentially systemic issues and prioritize problems. For example, hearing from students who cannot afford to repay their private student loans and are working two jobs to make ends meet can teach us more about the kinds of information students need before they take out those loans. Or if older Americans tell us about problems with reverse mortgages, we can devote resources to exploring measures to address the problems they are describing.

We also offer our Consumer Complaint Database, which makes the underlying data available to the public to inform and affect the marketplace. As we are hearing from hundreds of thousands of consumers at an increasing rate, this growing repository of information yields an ever-more-detailed impression of what is happening to consumers in real time in the marketplace. This data can be helpful to industry and consumers alike in figuring out how to approach these issues. We are well aware that not all, or even most, consumer protection comes from government agencies. Market participants themselves are initially responsible for fundamental aspects of consumer protection including, for example, how a business decides to treat its customers and whether people are willing and able to stand up for themselves when they are mistreated. With this in mind, the Bureau has made information about consumer complaints available to the public, with the ability to download the data, aggregate it in various ways, and filter it based on specific search criteria, such as by complaint type, company, zip code, date, or any other combination of available variables.

We believe the disclosure of this information is one of the best tools government agencies can use to improve the operation of the marketplace. People across the spectrum can make their own judgments about it. For financial companies, this data can help them detect and understand problems in the rest of the market and assess their performance against their peers, which is information they cannot access in any other way. In fact, institutions have shown they want to minimize the number of complaints we receive about them and improve their handling of complaints. Data can also help them detect and reduce regulatory, enforcement, and litigation risks. And perhaps they can find things to tout in the data: taking credit, for example, for having low complaint volumes or quick response times.

For consumers, the database can be a valued educational and shopping tool. They can see how companies respond and draw their own conclusions. Finally, anyone who wishes to do so can use the information to rate companies and products by evaluating what has been said about them in the aggregate, with opportunities for companies to respond with their own analysis. These matters can be fought out in the marketplace of ideas, subject ultimately to the verdict rendered by the court of public opinion, which is just how economic marketplaces are designed to work.

***

Our second approach to affecting the behavior of financial providers lies in our compulsory work through our supervision and law enforcement tools to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws. Through examinations, we can look into every pertinent aspect of how a firm interacts with consumers and require specific changes to be made to come into compliance with the law, including avoiding or terminating unlawful practices that are unfair to consumers. Redress to make consumers whole for past violations is also part of this process.

One notable aspect of the supervisory work we are doing is to create parity across competitors in each consumer financial market. Previously, the regulatory structure had been partial and incomplete, with federal oversight limited to chartered institutions such as banks, thrifts, and credit unions for purely historical and accidental reasons. Other financial companies competed against them but were not subject to the same level of scrutiny about their compliance efforts. We are now taking necessary and important steps to level the playing field in these markets, which is essential for a rational regulatory structure to have the chance to succeed.

Where appropriate, we seek such changes through enforcement actions also, which we can pursue in court or through our own administrative proceedings. In such actions, we can obtain injunctive relief as well as financial relief, including restitution or disgorgement for the benefit of consumers; we also impose civil penalties in cases as warranted by the defendant’s misconduct. All of these actions are designed to enforce the consumer financial laws that Congress placed within our authority, including fair lending laws and the statutory prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Those laws are worth nothing if they cannot be made to stick, so this work is crucial to fulfilling our duty to ensure fair, transparent, and competitive markets. Through combined supervisory and enforcement actions to date, we have made $5.3 billion in relief available to over 16 million consumers, and we have collected over $200 million in civil penalties.

From this work, we have come to believe that evenhanded oversight is necessary to foster true competition and ensure that all consumers are treated fairly in the marketplace. When honest and innovative businesses can succeed on the merits, it spurs their efforts to drive growth and progress. Appropriate oversight and enforcement empowers consumers by ensuring that markets function transparently. Upstanding businesses benefit the most when we hold accountable those that cheat their customers. Within those boundaries, businesses can compete aggressively with one another; when they do, consumers reap the benefits through improved products and services. Restoring both the perception and the reality of law and order also helps to establish trust in the marketplace for household credit and other financial services. Consumers will be willing to offer their “custom” to providers on an ongoing basis when they feel confident and positive about the products and services they use and when they know themselves to be well served over time.

Throughout the process, we are making it a point to place the voice of the consumer at the center of both our supervision and our enforcement work. As we risk-scope examinations, we decide which companies and products to prioritize and we determine what exactly to look for at a given institution. A key data source is our base of consumer complaints, supplemented by the results of our ongoing market monitoring, which draws on a wealth of data and experience.

Consumer complaints also are an invaluable source of information to spur investigations that generate enforcement actions. We are thus able to combine the richness of individual stories with the more authoritative significance that comes when we graduate from anecdote to data. This occurs when we can see not just isolated complaints, but the patterns that are generated by comparing and contrasting hundreds or thousands of such consumer inputs over time. And we likewise look to the same kinds of information generated by other agencies and officials. In one instance – that of our enforcement actions against credit card companies for deceptive marketing of certain add-on products – we took some assurance from finding that similar practices had harmed consumers and led to extensive enforcement activity in other countries as well.

***

The third way we are affecting the behavior of financial providers is through substantive regulation, where it is merited. To some extent, our Congress has made some specific determinations about when we should use this tool. Most notably, it expressly directed us to adopt sweeping new rules to root out some of the worst abuses in the mortgage market, either restricting or banning certain exotic products and practices that had harmed consumers and insisting on more robust levels of engagement between providers and consumers to avoid and mitigate such harm. We have also undertaken or are considering substantive policy interventions on remittance transfers, prepaid cards and accounts, debt collection, and small-dollar loans (sometimes known as “payday loans”). Where we can do so effectively, we are also looking to adopt regulations that improve disclosures around financial products and services. Yet we do not think improved disclosure alone is necessarily an effective substitute for substantive regulation where the latter is justified on the facts as we understand them.

It is important for us to recognize that our power to effect specific change in the business of financial providers is at its zenith when we write new rules. Here we are most clearly exercising quasi-legislative authority as delegated from Congress itself, and we must do so carefully, through deliberate and thoughtful processes. We are obliged to be faithful to the authority actually delegated to us, to make reasonable and well-supported decisions within the range of the discretion conferred upon us, and to work through a public notice-and-comment process to ensure that we seek out and digest a broad range of input before finalizing our regulations.

We can, of course, always revisit our judgments if we find new information indicating that we may not have struck the right balance on our first try. When we are convinced of the need, we have shown that we will not hesitate to put aside pride of authorship in our quest to “get it right” as best we can. We have already adopted meaningful amendments to our initial regulation on remittance transfers to improve its practicality, for example, and we continue to respond to numerous suggestions by adjusting and modifying our rules governing the mortgage market.

But here too, the voice of the consumer is critical to prompting and shaping our efforts. And we will take up that voice wherever we can find it. Of course, we look to our database of consumer complaints as one very useful indicator of the need for such policy interventions. We also closely scrutinize market and field intelligence, looking for developments that may help shape our strategic approach. Consumers, of course, can speak directly to us, but they also speak more generally by their behavior in the marketplace. And we attend closely to what we learn from financial providers themselves, both in direct discussions and by seeing how markets are changing over time. Our regulatory judgments are further informed by what we glean from supervisory examinations and enforcement investigations about the evolving relationships between financial providers and consumers. Once again, we agree here with Adam Smith, who wrote in The Wealth of Nations that “the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.”

***

In addition, we have found that we can affect the behavior of financial providers by publishing information about consumer financial markets, including data showing how the markets operate and illuminating certain practices. We frequently quote former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis – one of America’s original consumer advocates over a century ago – who famously said that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” Through a great number of research reports, white papers, “Data Points,” bulletins, blogs, guidance documents, webinars, and virtually every form of written or oral communication that we can devise, we try to foster and advance public understanding of these issues that are so central to the well-being of individuals and families.

One of our goals is simply greater awareness of these issues, which may help affect the behavior of producers and consumers alike. Another is to influence and engage other policymakers, who have their own authority to act in light of data thus assembled and analyzed. To date, our reports and publications on reverse mortgages, student loans, mortgage origination, medical debt, credit reporting, credit scoring, and payday lending – to present what is not by any means an exhaustive list – has had visible effects on public policy at both the federal and state levels in our federalist system of government. At times, our publications have called out questionable or disreputable practices, and the mere attention to such matters, once spread before the public and the media, tends to have salutary and desirable effects on market behavior.

At the same time, one of our guiding principles is to develop data that will shed more light on consumer financial markets and, to the extent we can, make it available to the public for others to see what we might have missed. If this leads to insights by consumers themselves, advocates, academics, journalists, industry, and others, then so much the better. Here too, international comparisons may be apt at times, and we draw your attention to our published reports, research, and discussions made available on our website at consumerfinance.gov. We hope you will consider how any of this information might be put to use in new and innovative ways. But then, please, do us the favor of telling us about it as well!

***

Finally, we come to the other question you had originally posed: How can regulators (or others) empower consumers by communicating effectively with them about issues like financial literacy, rights, and protections so that they can be in the best position to look out for their own interests? This is a subject of urgent interest across borders and cultures, for wherever there are consumers, they have difficulties managing the ways and means of their lives.

As we saw earlier, in most places we have certainly come a long way as consumers from the state of nature pessimistically described by Thomas Hobbes: “and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” But we all are keenly aware of our lack of comprehensive knowledge about these matters. And more than that, we feel an incapacity at times to act on what we know by doing the right things – that is to say, the prudent or sensible things – that may be most compatible with our own self-interest, properly understood as projected over time. Behavioral economists are developing and testing various theories about why consumers often fail to make sound choices that will be sustainable over the longer trajectory of their future lives. We need to have an active conversation about financial choices and financial management, both to learn the best paths and to find ways to traverse them effectively.

Let me be the first to say that we have not discovered any magic answers here. Among the many challenges are the inconvenient facts that financial issues can be intricate and complex, that they may press on sensitive sore spots, that people often are embarrassed or ashamed to discuss them candidly, and that the busy occupations of life do not lend themselves to setting aside time for concentrated study of such matters, even if we knew where to go for such guidance.

We are committed to undertaking new research to learn more about how to proceed here, including our recent report on the topic of financial well-being, which I invite you to read. But in the meantime, we are not content to wait while we study, and so we are acting on certain instincts in trying to reach consumers with appropriate and helpful information. Let me describe our main projects and some of our thinking about them, in hopes of stimulating further ideas from you and others.

To begin with, we start from the recognition that consumer financial markets are difficult for people to navigate effectively. One crucial task is to find ways to render this landscape more accessible to people if we possibly can. The markets for consumer credit and household finance hold more potential than ever before, but they are also more complex than ever before. And with complexity comes more risk of getting it wrong and being harmed. When my parents were raising a family fifty years ago, the products and services available to them were more limited but also more straightforward. Basic mortgages, a few in-store credit cards, and some limited consumer loans were about the extent of the offerings. There was not much to be done with them, but it was not possible to get into too much trouble unless you tried pretty hard to do so.

Today, the array of offerings is much broader and the actual mechanics can be harder to grasp. On the front end, credit reporting and scoring have opened more horizons for tapping consumer credit markets, and on the back end the increased tools and resources available to debt collectors, along with computerized recordkeeping, may lengthen the damaging tail of credit failures. Over the years, strenuous efforts to address consumer finance issues through detailed and extensive disclosures have had only partial success. This approach has made it hard to distinguish what is important from what is unimportant. Consumers may fail to understand the description of costs and risks and many simply avoid wading into the increasingly fine print altogether.

Our main strategy for attacking these problems has been what we call our “Know Before You Owe” approach to various consumer financial products and services. Essentially, it is a short-form approach to consumer disclosures, drawing on the concept of executive summaries found today at the front of most lengthy reports in almost any field. By leveraging our expertise and consumer research to pull out the most essential points and help people focus on them, we are making it possible once again to see the forest for the trees. This approach seeks to avoid failed decision-making, with consequent troubles and regrets. After all, two basic premises of a well-functioning market are first, that buyers and sellers understand the terms of the deal, and second, that buyers are able to compare possible alternatives.

We have heard many such regrets from consumers describing decisions they made about their mortgages, home equity loans, student loans, and other credit products. By streamlining disclosures and highlighting the key points about costs and risks, our new agency has joined in the lead set by our Congress to create simplified and more uniform disclosures for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans that also make it easier to compare the pros and cons of competing products. We are also working on the same approach in our proposed regulations for prepaid cards. So one way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by revising the kind of information they receive when they make decisions about obtaining financial products and services. We believe this will help especially by making it easier for consumers to avoid the pitfalls and confusions of “back-end pricing,” where the apparent terms of the deal as presented up front do not match the ultimate terms when they are revealed, or perhaps as they have migrated, somewhere down the road.

Another way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by forging partnerships with those who already have developed substantial trust and expertise with certain segments of the public. We are working with them to deliver content to consumers on financial issues as an integrated piece of the work they are already doing to deliver other services. With social service providers, and now with labor unions, community volunteers, and legal services offices, we have been developing a toolkit we call “Your Money, Your Goals,” which provides training to address topics like budgeting daily expenses, managing debt, and avoiding financial tricks and traps. We also are partnering with hundreds of library systems all over the country to train librarians, deliver content, and encourage sessions that bring in other partners such as credit counseling services. These resources for addressing consumer financial issues are striking a chord with patrons who, we have found, are turning to their local libraries in growing numbers to deal with their personal economic issues.

An important and difficult issue in the United States is how to accomplish what everyone knows needs to be done, which is to communicate more effectively with young people in our schools through greater focus on financial education. In our country, education operates primarily at the state and local level, which means that control over the classroom is not readily susceptible to centralized decision-making that can set the specifics of the curriculum. A growing number of states are taking action to incorporate more financial education into the classroom. But even in the wake of the global financial crisis, where many consumers were hurt badly by their lack of know-how in guarding against potential harm, progress here seems achingly slow. We have published a report summarizing the best thinking in the area of K-12 financial education in the United States, with our recommendations. But we are quite interested in efforts we see being made around the world, and we are aware that we may have much to learn from you and others about how we can better develop our young people into stronger and more capable consumers.

Although I will not undertake to summarize all of the work we are doing here, one further way we are communicating with consumers is by developing resources to help people find the information they need, at the right time, to manage some of the challenges they are confronting. Certain financial decisions are not everyday matters, but may arise only once or twice in a lifetime. Almost by definition, we lack experience and expertise with such issues, which may nonetheless be some of the most significant and lasting decisions we will ever make.

In the United States, two such major decisions concern paying for college and buying a home. With the U.S. Department of Education we created a “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet” to help students navigate the complex world of student loans; it allows students to compare financial aid packages and to understand the burdens they will face after graduation. We have built around that resource to create a set of tools we call “Paying for College” to help people navigate this decision-making process from beginning to end.

More recently, we launched another set of resources that we call “Owning a Home,” which is an interactive, online toolkit designed to help consumers as they shop for a mortgage. These tools are designed to give consumers the information and confidence they need to get the best deal. Right now, we have made public the beta version of this resource, which will be enhanced and improved over the course of the year.

Another, broader resource is “Ask CFPB,” an online database that provides carefully considered answers to over a thousand questions we have been frequently asked by consumers. The answers reflect the deep expertise of our colleagues, but are laid out in plain language to make them easy to understand. They also are grouped by issue area, so that if a consumer encounters a new problem with a debt collector, for example, they can learn all about their rights and the issues that may be involved. In this manner, we are seeking to help people engage in consumer self-protection, which is critical to their empowerment. We continue to add more questions and refine the answers in response to suggestions and comments from the public – including, if you are willing, from you as well.

Finally, we are communicating with consumers through specialty offices that home in on unique problems faced by certain categories of consumers. We focus on students, older Americans, servicemembers, and those with low to moderate incomes who are often financially vulnerable. This focus allows us to understand and address particular challenges that impede their financial success. It also enables us to reach out more effectively to provide these populations with the resources that will help them deal with the same kinds of problems that confront consumers more generally.

Those are some of the main examples of how we are seeking to communicate more effectively with consumers. As we work to ensure that financial institutions are not designing or marketing products in ways that hurt consumers, we are also striving to put people in a position to make good choices for themselves, choices that enhance their lives and empower them to succeed. People need better information about the costs and risks of borrowing. They need to be able to comparison shop for a good deal. They deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the deal they were promised is the deal they are actually getting, not just tomorrow, but next month and next year as well. It is not so easy for people to figure out where to go to find such answers from a neutral source. Much of the information they may find on-line today is shaped by financial providers that are trying to sell a product or service, which may skew the advice they are giving. It is quite important for our new agency to continue to build a reputation as a trusted, expert, neutral resource that can look out for consumers and help them look out for themselves.

***

I have spoken at length here tonight, and now I am almost done. Obviously the project of affecting the behavior of financial providers and financial consumers poses enormous challenges. We have seen all too clearly that if these products are predatory, or if they are misunderstood or misused, they can do real damage to people’s lives. At the Consumer Bureau, we envision a financial marketplace where providers play by the rules and treat consumers fairly. In addition, people need to make choices that fit their circumstances – nobody can do that for them – and take responsibility for the choices they make. They should be able to have the confidence that comes from knowing that dangerous or abusive products and practices are being limited. Through fair rules, consistent oversight, appropriate law enforcement, and broad consumer engagement, we are helping to restore trust in these markets, protect consumers from improper conduct, and ensure access to a fair, competitive, and transparent financial marketplace.

That is a worthy piece of work for anyone, anywhere. As Albert Camus said in the Myth of Sisyphus, “The struggle itself . . . is enough to fill one’s heart.” So let me close by saying that we look forward to working with you and the international community to improve people’s financial lives across the globe. Together, we can perpetuate the steadfast spirit of Ruby Hutchison as we seek to fulfill our shared goals. The people we serve are the ones who deserve that the most. Thank you.

Many HSAs suffer from low interest rate yields and junk fees to switch

MAY 01, 2024
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today released a report detailing the complex costs and fees that many consumers with health savings accounts are forced to pay. There were approximately 36 million health savings accounts in 2023 – holding more than $116 billion. These accounts provide tax benefits to help offset the costs of high deductible health plans. However, these benefits are being offset by charges like monthly maintenance fees, paper statement fees, outbound transfer fees, and account closure fees. Today’s report is part of the CFPB’s continuing efforts to reduce the risks and costs brought by financial institutions as they increase their presence in the American healthcare system.

“Health savings accounts are promoted for the tax benefits that chip away at the price tag of health care,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Many consumers do not realize the fees, switching costs, and low interest yields that will come with the accounts.”    

A health savings account is a tax-advantaged account that generally comes with a high deductible health plan. Typically, a health savings account is in the form of a deposit account selected by an employer or a health insurance company. An employee makes tax-deductible contributions that can then be used for certain health care expenses. Unspent contributions can earn interest, and roll over each year. The individual and family contribution limits for 2024 are $4,150 and $8,300, respectively.

Health savings accounts today hold more than $116 billion, a 500 percent increase since 2013. Additionally, the number of accounts rose more than three times from 2013 to 2023, 11.8 million to 35 million, respectively. The significant growth in the accounts has coincided with the rising use of high deductible health plans.

Consumers have reported a range of concerns with health savings accounts. For some consumers, these accounts come with high costs. Employers often decide on the financial service provider that will manage employees’ health savings accounts. The factors that motivate employers can differ from those of employees. Providers design health savings accounts to compete for employers. The result is that health savings accounts can often present challenges and costs for consumers, such as surprise fees, lack of fund portability, and low-yield interest rates.

When a consumer ends up with a health savings account with high fees and inferior terms, it directly reduces the funds they can allocate to their health care needs. High deductible health plans have higher deductibles than other health plans, so many individuals with these plans, such as people with chronic illnesses, experience higher upfront out-of-pocket health care costs.

High costs and fees can quickly erode a consumer’s ability to pay medical bills. In the case of health savings accounts such fees and costs can also erode tax savings. Specifically, the CFPB’s report found:

Costly, complex, and captive junk fee structures: Many providers that offer health savings accounts charge various fees, including monthly maintenance fees and paper statement fees. Expensive exit fees, like outbound transfer fees and account closure fees, can hold consumers, who may not have selected their accounts, captive to their current providers. The fees are costly and typically unavoidable.
Low interest yields: Despite the recent increase in interest rates across the United States most providers offer consistently low interest rates. Typically, these rates are less than 1%, and, sometimes, even 0%. As a result, consumers could incur significantly more in fees than they earn in interest.

The CFPB has been working to reduce the financial consequences of medical debts as well as to ensure consumers are treated fairly by providers participating in the health care sphere. In September 2023, the CFPB initiated a rulemaking to remove medical bills from many credit reports. In July 2023, the CFPB, along with other federal agencies, launched an inquiry into costly credit cards and loans pushed on patients to pay for health care costs.

Radjabli placed customer funds in risky investment vehicles and crypto-assets, including the now-defunct Celsius Network

DEC 01, 2022
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action against Loan Doctor to resolve the CFPB’s claims that the company and its founder, Edgar Radjabli, broke the law by deceiving consumers into thinking they were depositing funds into a guaranteed return savings product within a commercial bank. Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that deposited funds would be used to originate loans for healthcare professionals, would be held in insured accounts or backed by cash alternatives, and would yield interest rates between 5% and 6.25%. If approved by the court, the proposed settlement would require the defendants to refund all the deposits made, including all interest due to consumers. The defendants would also pay a civil money penalty, and be permanently banned from engaging or assisting others in any deposit taking activities. Radjabli has been separately charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“Loan Doctor and its founder masqueraded as a traditional bank to open accounts for people seeking a high-yield savings product,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “In reality, this outfit and its ringleader were using customer funds for risky investments.”

My Loan Doctor, which does business as Loan Doctor, is a Delaware financial services company operating in West Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City. Loan Doctor purported to offer customers a Healthcare Finance Savings CD account that would yield, according to the company, “the highest return of any savings product in the US.” In addition to being its founder, Edgar Radjabli, was an officer of Loan Doctor and responsible for its management.

The CFPB alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli made several false, misleading, and inaccurate marketing representations in advertising Loan Doctor’s Healthcare Finance Savings CD account. Starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took millions of dollars from at least 400 individuals who opened and deposited money into Loan Doctor’s deceptively advertised savings product. Specifically, Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that:

Customer deposits would originate loans for healthcare professionals: Loan Doctor and Radjabli told depositors that when it originated a loan, it would have an investor lined up to purchase it. In fact, Loan Doctor never used the deposits to originate loans for healthcare professionals, and it never entered into a contract with a buyer or investor to purchase a loan.
Customer deposits would be secure: Loan Doctor represented that when not being used to originate loans, deposited funds would be held in an FDIC-insured account or an account insured by Lloyd’s of London, or backed by a “cash alternative” or “cash equivalent.” Loan Doctor also stated that it maintained a cash reserve in an amount equivalent to the amount customers deposited. CFPB’s investigation found that Radjabli instead placed funds in a hedge fund he controlled and in crypto-assets, such as Celsius Network. Deposited funds were also invested in actively traded securities or loaned, through a third party, to investors using individual stock portfolios as collateral.
Loan Doctor was a commercial bank: Loan Doctor misled customers to believe they were depositing their funds into accounts like traditional savings accounts that had guaranteed returns. In fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank, and depositors’ funds were invested in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.
Healthcare Finance High-Yield CD accounts had a record of paying high interest rates: Loan Doctor stated that the accounts paid interest at rates between 5% and 6.25% in years prior to 2019. In fact, Loan Doctor did not begin taking consumer deposits until August 2019.
Enforcement Action

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The proposed settlement, if approved by the court, would require Loan Doctor and Radjabli to:

Refund approximately $19 million to approximately 400 depositors: The defendants would have to return the money that each affected person deposited into a Loan Doctor Healthcare Finance High Yield CD account, and in a manner consistent with the advertised terms of the product – namely, the principal along with an average per year interest rate of about 6%.
Stop engaging in deposit taking activities: The defendants would be permanently banned from engaging or assisting others in any deposit taking activities.
Pay a $391,530 fine: The order would require defendants to pay a civil money penalty to the CFPB in the amount of $391,530. A portion of that penalty, $241,530, will be remitted because the defendants paid that amount in penalties to the SEC due to a similar action brought by that agency. The remainder of the penalty would be deposited into the CFPB’s victims relief fund.

Read today’s proposed order. 

Consumers can submit complaints about financial products or services by visiting the CFPB’s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).

Employees of companies who they believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.
