Avalanche debt payoff method comparison,6 proven strategies to pay off credit card debt faster in 2023,No disponible,https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/6-proven-strategies-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-faster-in-2023-01672138324?mod=search_headline,"Credit card debt is stressful — and costly. The good news? Like thousands of others have before you, you can get out of it — though there is no one-size-fits-all answer as for the best way to accomplish reaching a $0 balance, pros say. Here are six options for getting out of credit card debt, and the pros and cons of each below: 

Pay off the account with the lowest balance first, while continuing to pay the minimums on all other accounts.
Pay off highest interest debts first, while making the minimum payments on the rest.
Do a balance transfer to a 0% APR card and aggressively pay that down.
Take advantage of debt consolidation, using something like a personal loan, which could offer a lower interest way to consolidate debt. (See the lowest personal loan rates you may qualify for here.)
Pay more than the minimum on all your cards all the time.
Take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to provide a lower interest way to consolidate high-interest debt on other loans like credit cards. (See the lowest HELOC rates you may get now here.)

So which is the right strategy for you?  It depends, and we talk to pros so they can help you pick the best strategy for you.

1. Pay off the account with the lowest balance first, while continuing to pay the minimums on all other accounts.

It can be motivating — and help you stay motivated on your debt payoff journey — to knock out your entire lowest-balance debt. This is a strategy that’s commonly referred to as the “snowball method,” because it helps build up momentum to pay off debt.

To do it, make a list of all your account balances in order of smallest to largest — and include the minimum payment amount for each — and allocate funds to pay the minimum amount due on all of your accounts except the one with the smallest balance.

For the account with the lowest balance, pay as much of the total due as you can until you’ve paid off all the debt and then continue to do the same thing with the account that’s next on your list.

Pros and cons
You’ll likely notice progress quickly depending on how low your lowest balance is
This method can help provide motivation to continue paying off debt
You may pay more interest over time compared to paying the high-interest debt first
2. Pay off high-interest debts first, while making minimum payments on the rest.

This is known as the “avalanche method,” and it’s the most advantageous from a dollars and cents perspective because you’re canceling out your highest-interest accounts sooner rather than later.

Once you’ve paid off the account with the largest balance, you put the same amount of money you were paying towards that debt to the account with the next highest interest rate. Then you continue to do this until you’ve reached the bottom of your list of accounts. Of course, you’re always paying the minimums on all your debts.

Pros and cons
You’ll save the most money by tackling your highest interest rate debts first
You can lower how much you’re paying in interest
Progress can be slow at first
It can take time to make a dent in large balances
Staying motivated can be challenging
3. Do a balance transfer to a 0% APR card and aggressively pay that down.

With a balance transfer, you’re simply moving high-interest debt from one credit card to another that doesn’t charge interest for a set period of time, usually up to about 21 months. (See some of the best balance transfer cards of 2022 here.)

“Once the promotion ends, the interest rate goes back up, so if you can, pay down your debt completely while it’s interest-free,” says Sara Rathner, personal finance expert at NerdWallet.

Taking advantage of a 0% balance transfer card involves opening a new credit card with an interest-free promotional term, and Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, says this is his favorite debt payoff tactic because of how high interest rates are.

“Be disciplined about paying it off. I suggest refraining from making any new purchases with the card, since the interest rate will skyrocket once the promotional period ends,” says Rossman.

To come up with a successful payment plan, given that you won’t have to pay interest, divide what you owe by the number of months in your 0% term and try to stick with that monthly payment plan so you can achieve a $0 balance by the time your regular APR kicks in. (See some of the best balance transfer cards of 2022 here.)

You can save hundreds of dollars if you have a few thousand dollars in credit card debt, because you aren’t being charged interest. “There’s usually an upfront transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, but it can still be well worth it,” says Rossman.

But doing a balance transfer may require a high credit score depending on the card, so it may not be an option for everyone. “Ideally, this card would also have no annual fee and would charge a $0 fee for balance transfers, however even a one-time fee of 3% to 5% of your existing balance to initiate a balance transfer could be much better than paying 20% or more in APR,” says Ewen.

Pros and cons
Can save you money by you not having to pay interest
Requires discipline to pay the card off before the intro period ends
There may be a fee to do the balance transfer or an annual fee on the card
4. Take advantage of debt consolidation using something like a personal loan, which could offer a lower interest way to consolidate debt.

Taking out a personal loan is a popular form of debt consolidation, and if you have good credit, you might be able to get a loan with an interest rate that’s significantly lower than your credit card’s rate. “You can use this loan to pay off your higher-cost credit debts and then you repay the personal loan company — which sure beats paying 15% to 20% on credit cards,” says Rossman. See the lowest personal loan rates you may qualify for here.

Another way to consolidate debt: Sign up for a debt management plan offered by a reputable nonprofit credit counseling agency, such as Money Management International. “These often involve something like a 6% rate over 5+ years plus nominal monthly fees,” says Rossman.

“Many online lenders issue what’s called a credit card consolidation loan. They’ll effectively consolidate the balances on your high-interest cards by combining multiple payments into a single one, paid out monthly over a set term,” says Ewen.

Pros and cons
You need to have great credit
A nonprofit credit counseling agency can provide you with helpful advice along the way
You’ll have one equal monthly payment to pay off a personal loan
It can be easier to budget for
These loans have their own APRs, so this really only makes sense if the loan’s rate is lower than the rest of your cards
Some lenders require high credit scores to qualify for the lowest rates, so if your score is low, this may not be an option
5. Paying more than the minimum on your cards at all times.

Ideally, everyone would pay their entire credit card balances in full every month, rendering interest a moot point. Unfortunately, only about half of cardholders are able to do that.

“If you can’t pay the entire monthly statement balance, it still makes sense to pay as much over the minimum as you can afford. If you only carry a balance for a short time, the interest charges probably won’t be so bad,” says Rossman.

Pros and cons
Paying just the minimum will lock you in a cycle of debt for years; paying more will shorten that cycle
If you pay the bill in full every month, you can avoid debt entirely
The vast majority of credit card issuers impose no penalties for making mid-cycle payments
It can be tough to do this when you’re struggling with other bills
6. Take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to provide a lower interest way to consolidate high-interest debt.

For borrowers with substantial equity in their home, HELOCs can aid in consolidating high-interest debt like credit cards.

HELOCs are generally composed of a two-part structure; most commonly a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period that together equal a 30-year term. A borrower can withdraw as much or little as they like during the draw period, but once the repayment period begins, money can no longer be withdrawn and the borrower must begin to repay the principal loan in addition to interest.

The amount of money available to a HELOC borrower will vary as the loan amount is based on how much equity one has in their home. See the best HELOC rates you can get here.

Pros and cons
HELOCs tend to be one of the most affordable loan types for homeowners with significant equity in their home
If you don’t repay your HELOC, you can lose your home
You may need a high credit scores, low debt-to-income ratios and substantial equity in your homes to qualify
Other things to know

Ultimately, whichever method you choose, you will likely need to budget to come up with the extra money to repay your debt. “Start by writing down everything you spend money on in a month. Don’t judge yourself, just write it down,” says Rathner. Then, carefully analyze the total take-home income you expect to earn each month. “Map out all of the essential items that must be paid for like housing, groceries, utilities and take a very critical eye to your discretionary spending,” says Ewen.

Bankrate recently found that 51% of Americans who have ever had a subscription or membership account have experienced unwanted charges. “It’s easy to forget about free trials that turn into paid subscriptions. Even things you once willingly paid for may now be wasteful,” says Rossman. “Look for other ways to be a more thoughtful consumer as well. You don’t need to cut back on everything, but think long and hard about whether or not something is bringing you joy and delivering value,” says Rossman.

In this series, NerdWallet interviews people who have triumphed over debt. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

Rashad and Nirvanna Muhammad

How much: $179,000 in 3 years and 10 months

Rashad Muhammad, a school principal and part-time real-estate agent, started racking up debt while attending Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona, Florida. That’s where he met his wife, Nirvanna, who had her own financial struggles.

Although he had a football scholarship, injuries led Muhammad to take out student loans during his junior year. After graduating, he took out more loans to pursue a master’s degree in educational administration.

We had to tell the judge our total debt out loud and I remember hearing someone chuckle in the background. It was eye-opening and humiliating.

— Rashad Muhammad

The couple merged finances after getting married in 2005, combining their student loans, credit card debt and car loans, and later moved to Texas in 2007.

As their family started to grow, their debt grew, too — at one point reaching $250,000. Their debt weighed heavily on Muhammad, especially when Nirvanna temporarily stopped working as a teacher in 2011 to have their second child.

Feeling desperate, the couple decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011. [Editor’s note: In some cases, bankruptcy is the best option for handling overwhelming debt. If your non-mortgage debt is more than 40% of your income or would take more than five years to pay off, consult with a bankruptcy attorney.]

The process eliminated their unsecured credit card debt, but it didn’t dramatically alter their finances — or their spending habits — overnight. They still had student loans. They also took out new car loans to replace the cars they lost during bankruptcy. In the midst of having their third child in 2012, they amassed more credit card debt. By the spring of 2013, they owed $179,000.

Over nearly four years, the couple took steps and made sacrifices to pay it all off. By January 2017, they were officially debt-free.

Today they live comfortably in Fort Worth, Texas, with their three children, ages 7, 9 and 13, and are able to afford vacations and save for retirement.

Muhammad spoke with NerdWallet about recovering from bankruptcy, what he learned about tackling debt as a couple and which financial goals they’re prioritizing now.

What was your total debt before you declared bankruptcy and when you started your repayment journey? What is it today?

Before bankruptcy, it was around $250,000. We had $30,000 on one car, $25,000 on another car, $125,000 in student loans and $70,000 in credit card debt. After bankruptcy, we ran up more credit card debt and had to get new car loans. By March of 2013, we had $179,000 of debt. Today we are debt-free except for the remainder of our 15-year mortgage.

How did you originally end up in debt?

I went to college on a football scholarship and knew nothing about finance at the time. I didn’t know anything about saving and had been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life, which I thought was normal. My wife also had student loans and credit card debt.

As a football player, I wasn’t allowed to have a part-time job because it was considered illegal to work while playing football. After I got injured during my junior year, I started taking on student loans. I also got a master’s degree after graduating, so I went up to $59,000 in student debt.

What made you two decide to declare bankruptcy and what was the process like?

My wife had to take off a few months of work when we had our daughter in 2011, and the debt was overwhelming. When this second baby came, we were making decent money, but all the money was going back to our debt. We felt like we were drowning and had no way out. We had thought about doing it [declaring bankruptcy] for a year, but it was so taboo.

Also see: Why are so many people over 55 going bankrupt?

We had to go to a bankruptcy attorney, who filed a petition, and then we had a day in court. It was a day I’ll never forget. Our son was in preschool at the time, and our daughter was still a baby. We had to tell the judge our total debt out loud and I remember hearing someone chuckle in the background. It was eye-opening and humiliating.

How did bankruptcy affect your finances?

We lost our house and cars. We thought it could provide us some relief to move forward, but it didn’t solve all of our issues. You still have to rebound and recuperate. While bankruptcy eliminated our unsecured debt, we still had $125,000 in student loans and had to get two more cars — $22,000 in car loans — since we don’t work near each other. We also had a third child in 2012 and ended up running our credit card back up to $32,000.

What steps did you take to pay off the rest of your debt?

When we were on one income, we cashed out some of my wife’s retirement to help pay off the student loans. [Editor’s note: While it’s tempting to halt retirement savings or pull retirement funds out to speed your debt payoff, NerdWallet recommends against it. Amassing enough for retirement depends heavily on interest and returns compounding over many years.]

We used the debt snowball method. None of our interest rates were astronomical, so we knocked out the smaller loans first. Seeing two or three loans disappear quickly was powerful. We also completed Financial Peace University [Dave Ramsey’s nine-lesson class] in 2014. Any tax returns went to paying off debt.

We cut back on vacationing — only going to Atlanta and Florida to see family — and stopped eating out as much. We also drove older cars. For example, we got a 2003 Honda Pilot, which we kept for eight years. We didn’t care what people thought about what we drove.

What kept you motivated during your debt payoff journey?

We knew we wanted to be debt-free, but the “why” was the real motivation. Looking at the end goal — to start saving for retirement — helped a lot. I couldn’t really dig deep into paying off debt and save for retirement at the same time, and it ate at me knowing that I was missing out on opportunities for compound interest. We knew we’d be able to save more once we were debt-free.

We will teach our kids to only buy things they have money to buy. For their birthdays, we put money in their college funds.

— Rashad Muhammad

What have you learned about navigating debt as a couple?

My wife is the free spirit and I am the nerd; I like spreadsheets and she hates them. We had to understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

I’d go to my wife and say, “Hey babe, we’re down to $22,000 in debt, so let’s see how we can get it down to $18,000!” I learned that as the numbers came down, the more reluctant spouse starts to get on board.

Aside from that, it was so important for us to combine finances and make sure we both had equal say. I’ve always made 60% to 70% of our income, but it’s our money.

We will teach our kids to only buy things they have money to buy. For their birthdays, we put money in their college funds. We went on a cruise recently, and our kids were blown away. They’ll remember the cruise when they’re older, but they won’t remember a $15 toy. Experiences, not things, make us happy.

Why did you decide to get a house during your debt payoff period?

When we lost our home from filing for bankruptcy, we knew we wanted to get another one, but we wanted to get it the right way. That meant finding a home we could afford and getting a loan that fit our needs. We bought our home in May 2015, and paused our debt payoff — only paying the minimum — during this period [between October 2014 and May 2015]. We went through Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America [a homeowner assistance program], which didn’t require a down payment and had low interest rates. We went with a 15-year mortgage.

We didn’t wait until we were debt-free to buy a house. If we had, we would have bought at the top of the market and would probably have paid 20% more for the same house. We have a little more than 10 years to pay it off, but there’s no rush because the interest rate is low.

What would you have done differently?

I would have gone to community college and worked for two years while staying at home. If I could talk to 18-year-old me, I wouldn’t have applied for that first credit card without knowing anything about money — that set me on a road of debt, and the most important piece of building wealth is staying out of debt. I remember buying a set of $49 cellphones that didn’t even work.

What’s your income, and what are your financial goals now that you and your wife are debt-free?

My wife and I are both educators, and we’ve gotten 3% raises almost every year. Our joint salary is around $161,000 now. I also earned around $20,000 from real estate last year.

My goal is to make $50,000 from real estate this year and eventually $100,000 a year. That money goes toward retirement, my kids’ 529 plans, taxes and fun.

We want to retire at the ages of 52 and 54, respectively. We’re holding out until we get our pensions. I’ve been motivated by the FIRE [“financial independence, retire early”] movement.

We’re also going to Cabo for our 15th anniversary and have another cruise booked for the entire family for 2021. We couldn’t do these trips before.

What’s an unexpected benefit of being debt-free?

We were at dinner one day and saw a single mom eating with four kids. My wife and I looked at each other and it clicked — we told the server we’d cover her bill and tip. In the past when we had debt, we’d feel guilty doing something like that. How could we help people when we could barely help ourselves? Doing random acts of kindness wasn’t possible before, but it feels so good to be able to do that now.

How to ditch your own debt

If the Muhammads’ story motivates you to tackle your own debt, here are a few things to consider.

Weigh the pros and cons of bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy is certainly not for everyone, but it may be a smart option if your amount of debt (excluding a mortgage) exceeds 40% of your income, among other factors.
Decide which debt payoff method is right for you. The Muhammads used the debt snowball method, which prioritizes small loans, but the debt avalanche method targets debts with the highest interest rates first.
Get out of the comparison trap. Driving an older car (versus buying a brand-new one) helped the Muhammads save over time, but they had to shift their thinking. “We’re in a culture where we glamorize others. We see things and think they’re worth having,” he says.

While the bond market’s big rally may be due for a breather, there’s still plenty of opportunity to lock in attractive 4% to 5% yields.

Bonds were always supposed to have a strong 2024. But prices lagged for much of the spring, as stubborn inflation prompted the Federal Reserve to put off interest-rate cuts.

It has been welcome news for fixed-income investors—bond prices rise when interest rates fall. Bonds have rallied across the board, but longer-dated bonds, which are most sensitive to interest-rate changes, have posted some dramatic returns. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF 

TLT

-0.48%
, commonly known by its ticker symbol TLT, has returned 8.4% over the past three months, beating the 7.2% return of an exchange-traded fund 

MAGS

0.62%
 tracking the closely watched Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which include market heavyweights Nvidia 

NVDA

-1.02%
 and Apple 

AAPL

0.22%
.

While that is impressive, there’s reason to think the rally might lose momentum. Although Powell’s recent remarks seem to confirm a September rate cut is coming, Wall Street is expecting the Fed to go a lot further than that. Futures market data indicated investors expect no fewer than eight quarter-point interest rate cuts in the next year.

That outlook is far more aggressive than the Fed’s June estimates, which suggest a pace of about one-quarter point cut every three months. The central bank’s next set of economic projections won’t be released until September. If the pace of rate cuts is indeed slower than Wall Street hopes, it could quickly sap long-term bonds’ price momentum. 

Bonds also face longer-term structural risks. Treasury prices are sensitive to concerns about the U.S. budget deficit and the level of Treasury purchases by foreign governments.

U.S. debt recently reached 122% of gross domestic product, far above the 100% threshold long considered to signal danger. While the U.S. presidential election is neck and neck, both the Biden-Harris and Trump administrations have records of piling onto the deficit, even when not strictly necessary: Biden-Harris with late-in-the-game Covid-19 payments and Trump with 2019 tax cuts, which poured stimulus into an already-strong economy. 

In addition, political concerns—especially Chinese tariffs and sanctions against Russia—have led some foreign central banks to attempt to curb their Treasury holdings. For much of the year, China and other nations have been selling Treasuries and buying assets like gold as part of a long-term effort to reduce their political and economic dependence on the dollar. Central banks’ selling adds extra supply to Treasury markets, which naturally dampens prices. If China and other nations eventually succeed in dethroning the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, the consequences could be far more dire.

The upshot for investors: Chasing returns amid a rally can be risky with bonds, just like with stocks. On the other hand, plenty of bond funds still look attractive, even if you aren’t interested in gambling on where rates are headed next.

Given Powell’s recent remarks and the slowing U.S. economy, investors can be fairly certain that short-term interest rates are set to decline by some amount going into next year. If yield is part of your investment strategy, that makes it imperative to lock in today’s attractive rates as long as you can. 

The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF 

BND

-0.13%
 boasts a yield of 4.2%. That’s below the 5% or more investors can currently earn on short-term instruments like money-market funds. But with an average duration of about six years, you should be able to count on the broad-based fund to generate income for years to come.

Investors can do slightly better with the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF 

LQD

0.01%
, which boasts a yield of 4.9% and a duration of just over eight years. While that means taking on some credit risk, investment-grade bonds rarely default, even during recessions. What’s more, the odds are still on for the Fed to pull off a soft landing, and curb inflationary pressures while skirting a recession.

My wife and I are 68 and 65, respectively. We both are retired and collecting Social Security with a combined income of $67,000 per year. We have IRAs of $1. 2 million, stock investments of $50,000 and $30,000 in cash in a local bank. 

The portfolio is nicely diversified and, for the past two years, our interest has covered the monthly draws so net-net, the total value of the portfolio has remained the same. We are taking distributions from these funds to cover living expenses."
