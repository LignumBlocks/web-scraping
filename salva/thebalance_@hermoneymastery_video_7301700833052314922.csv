THE GOOD BRIGADE / GETTY IMAGES

To effectively pay off your debts, you can prioritize them and figure out how much to pay each month with a good strategy.

The debt snowball and debt avalanche methods are two popular debt payoff tactics, but they're not the only ones. Here, we'll review a few common strategies to help you explore which may be best for you. To find your best debt reduction strategy, consider your preference for saving money on interest, the amount you can pay each month, and your need for motivation.

Debt Snowball

With the snowball method, you pay your debts off from the smallest to the largest amount due, regardless of interest rate or other account factors.

This technique allows you to pay off small debts quickly, making more progress toward catching up with accounts. Once you pay off one account, roll over that monthly payment to the next account while continuing minimum payments on your other debts. Repeat the process until all your accounts are paid off.

With the debt snowball method, you’d arrange your debts priorities from lowest to highest, like this:

BALANCE	APR
$850	22%
$1,400	18%
$3,600	24%
$5,325	14%

You’d start your debt payoff by paying as much as you can toward the $850 credit card balance since it's the lowest while paying just the minimum due on the remaining accounts.

Debt Avalanche

With the debt avalanche method, you start by paying off your debt with the highest interest rate, regardless of the total balance or monthly payment.

Similar to the debt snowball method, you focus on paying off one debt at a time. First, you make sure you pay the minimum payments on all your accounts. Then, you’d contribute any extra money as one lump sum to one account until you pay off the highest-interest card. After that, you’d focus on the debt with the second-highest interest rate.

Under the debt avalanche method, here’s how you’d pay off the same balances listed before:

BALANCE	APR
$3,600	24%
$850	22%
$1,400	18%
$5,325	14%

With the avalanche method, rank your debt by interest rate, from highest to lowest. Under this plan, you'd start by paying off the balance with the 24% APR while making the minimum payments on the remaining accounts.

Debt Consolidation

Consolidating your debts allows you to combine multiple debts into a single balance so you can pay your total debts off with one payment. If you primarily have credit card debt—or balances that can be paid off with a credit card—you can transfer all the balances to one balance transfer credit card, then focus on paying down your larger credit card balance.

Combining debts with a debt consolidation loan is another option for merging multiple credit card balances. This type of personal loan is used to pay off debt balances. You can also pay a debt consolidation company to oversee the process for you, but you can save money by consolidating debts yourself.

Debt consolidation may allow you to save money on interest if you consolidate with a low-interest-rate loan. You may also be able to pay your debt off faster, depending on your monthly payment.

Note

Once you've consolidated your debt, you'll open up your available credit on your credit cards again. Be careful not to use your credit cards while paying off your consolidation loan, or you will only increase your debt.

Debt Management Plan

If you're having a hard time paying your bills, repaying your debts under a debt management plan (DMP) can give you a break on interest and the monthly payment amount. A DMP is a payment agreement with your credit card issuers, typically three to five years, and is arranged by a consumer credit counseling agency.

Once your plan is approved, you'll make one payment each month to the credit counseling agency, which will divide your payments and send them to your credit card issuers.

Note

You won't be able to use your credit cards while you're on a DMP.

Which Method Is Right for You?

The method you choose for paying back your debts is a critical decision, Jill Gianola, owner of Gianola Financial Planning, LLC, told The Balance in an email. She considers it a key factor in her clients' success in repaying their debts.

Save on Interest

The debt avalanche method saves money in the long run because you’re getting rid of your more expensive debts first. On the other hand, large high-interest rate debts can take a while to pay off, so you may not get the emotional satisfaction of clearing a whole credit card balance as quickly as you would with other methods.

The debt avalanche method may be good for you if you're disciplined, keep good records, and have a reliable monthly income, said Gianola, who also co-authored Single Women and Money: How To Live Well on Your Income.

Staying Motivated

For many people, the debt snowball method feels more rewarding, especially in the beginning, because you can quickly cross off smaller debts as you pay them off. Despite being more expensive in terms of interest costs, Gianola recommends the debt snowball method for people who need to see progress to stick with their plan.

""Even though they may end up paying more interest on their loans, these clients are more likely to stay on track with the snowball method,"" said Gianola.

Note

We’ve created a Google Sheets spreadsheet (The Balance Credit Card Debt Worksheet) to help you collect your credit card details—and to help you do the math. In addition to summing up debt totals for any cards added to the list, the spreadsheet also calculates your credit utilization ratio, an important factor in credit scoring. You can use the worksheet to help you decide which debt to focus on first.

Large Debt Balances

Debt consolidation may be right for you if you're overwhelmed by the hassle of making multiple payments for your debts each month. Also, if your credit score is high enough, you can secure a loan or card with a lower interest rate than you're paying on existing debts.

But paid debt consolidation services should be approached with caution. The industry has been a target for scammers, Jim Pendergast told The Balance in an email. Pendergast is senior vice president of altLINE, a division of The Southern Bank Company. If you decide to use one of these services, look for legitimate businesses with references.

Affordable Payments

Consider a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency if you're having trouble making your minimum monthly payments.

Credit counselors can work with your creditors to lower your payments so that they're more affordable. Gianola cautions against using other types of debt relief companies, which may charge fees that can get you deeper into debt.

Below, you’ll find a summary of the four repayment strategies we’ve discussed.

	DEBT AVALANCHE	DEBT SNOWBALL	DEBT CONSOLIDATION	DEBT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Repayment Strategy	Pay debts one at a time, starting with the highest interest rate 	Pay debts one at a time, starting with the lowest balance	Pay debts that have been combined into a single balance	Pay debts through a credit counseling agency
What’s Required of You	Multiple monthly payments, one for each balance	Multiple monthly payments, one for each balance	One monthly payment toward the consolidated balance	One monthly payment to the credit counseling agency, assuming all debts are included in the plan
Advantages	Saves money on interest costs by getting rid of expensive debts first	Motivates by eliminating small debts quickly	Simplifies debt repayment by combining into one balance, often with a lower APR	Creates an affordable and manageable debt plan, often with a lower APR
Potential Downfalls	Large debts can take longer to pay	Potentially more expensive	Low credit score may limit attractive consolidation options	Credit cards are off-limits during the plan
The Bottom Line

Ultimately, the best debt payoff strategy will depend on your financial situation.

Now that you have a better understanding of these repayment techniques, consider which one will best fit your circumstances and your personality. Whether you prioritize saving or you want a motivational boost, choosing a plan that will work for you can lead to success with your personal financial goals.

DEFINITION

The debt avalanche strategy involves paying off your debts starting with the loan with the highest interest rate. You'll apply that payment to the loan with the next highest interest rate after the first one is paid off.

Key Takeaways
The debt avalanche strategy involves paying off what you owe by prioritizing your loans and credit card balances with the highest interest rates. 
The debt avalanche strategy is best for those who want to minimize interest. 
The debt snowball strategy pays off debt starting with the smallest balance. It offers small wins along the way. But you may pay more in interest with this method.
Speak with a nonprofit credit counseling agency if you can't afford your minimum monthly payments.
How the Debt Avalanche Works

The debt avalanche strategy involves prioritizing payment of loans and credit card balances based on their interest rates. You'll pay off those with the highest rates first.1

Here’s how to save on interest with the debt avalanche method.

Take inventory. Gather a list of everything you owe. List the debts in order of the interest rate on each loan or credit card. Start with the highest rate, and work down to the lowest. 

Pay your minimums. Keep making minimum payments on all your loans or credit card balances. You’ll focus on one balance at a time. But it's important to stay current on all of them to avoid fees and damage to your credit score.

Pay extra on the account with the highest rate with any additional money you have available each month. This reduces the amount you owe at that high rate.

Build momentum. Cross each loan off your list after paying it off. Redirect the amount you were paying on that loan to the one with the next highest interest rate.

Calculate your debt avalanche payoff schedule using a spreadsheet. You can use our loan calculator if you want to create your own schedule. It can help you to quickly determine how much interest you'll pay until a card or account is paid off.

Example of the Debt Avalanche Method

Suppose you owe money on the loans detailed below. Based on your monthly budget, you know that you have $150 more available each month for debt elimination. Which loan should be paid off first?

List each of your loans in order of the interest rate, with the highest rate at the top.

Debts to Pay Off
Type	Balance	Rate	Minimum Payment
Credit card	$16,000	17%	$480.00
Personal loan	$2,000	7%	$39.60
Private student loan	$13,000	5%	$183.74
Auto loan	$21,559	4.75%	$404.38
Medical office	$1,300	0%	$100

According to the debt avalanche method, that additional $150 at your disposal goes toward the credit card payment, because that loan has the highest interest rate. You pay $630 per month to your credit card issuer as a result: the $480 minimum payment  plus the additional $150.

That minimum payment goes away after you pay off the credit card, so you have even more cash flow available on a monthly basis. The $630 you were paying to your credit card company can now go toward the personal loan instead. You'll pay $669.60 ($630 plus your required $39.60) as a result. That will quickly eliminate the remaining loan balance. 

Now fold what you were paying on the personal loan into your additional payments. That will result in an additional $669.60 per month on your student loan. The total amount you then send to the loan servicer is $853.34: $669.60 plus the required $183.74.Continue the process, moving from one debt to the next, until you're debt-free.

Benefits of the Debt Avalanche Strategy

The debt avalanche is an effective strategy because it focuses on interest rates. A portion of each monthly payment goes toward interest charges on most loans. The remainder reduces your loan balance. You have to pay more to cover interest costs with higher rates, so your payment makes a smaller dent in your loan balance. You'll waste less money on interest by minimizing the overall interest you're paying, and your payments will work toward bringing your loan balances down.

Do I Need to Use the Debt Avalanche Strategy?

The debt avalanche might be a good fit for you if:

You want to minimize your total cost of borrowing. 
You believe in paying as little interest as possible.
You have the discipline to keep paying extra on a sizable debt for an extended period of time.
You don’t need positive reinforcement frequently or early in the process.
You're motivated by facts and figures.
Debt Avalanche Strategy vs. Debt Snowball
DEBT AVALANCHE	DEBT SNOWBALL
Pay off debt starting with the highest interest rate	Pay off debt starting with the lowest balance
Offers lower costs in the long term	May cost more in interest, but offers small ""wins"" as you pay off balances

A debt avalanche is an excellent strategy for minimizing costs and getting out of debt, but it might not be right for everyone. Another option is the debt snowball method.

You'll pay off your debts in order of size, from the smallest to largest, with this strategy. The idea behind the debt snowball method is that having small wins early on helps to keep you motivated to stick with your debt-reduction plan, but this method could end up costing you more in total interest overall. 

A debt snowball strategy might be a better option if you’re likely to lose motivation during your debt elimination journey. The method provides small victories early in the process and can help you stay disciplined. It can keep hope alive. You have to trust that it’s best to pay down loans with high rates first with the debt avalanche strategy. It might take a long time to you pay off a loan.

Note

There would be no rush to pay off an interest-free medical debt first with a debt avalanche strategy. It doesn’t cost you any interest. But the debt snowball would instruct you to pay that loan off first, because it has the smallest loan balance.

What To Do if You Need Extra Help Paying Off your Debt

The debt avalanche method can be a beneficial solution for some, but others may need additional guidance. You have at least two other options:

Credit Counseling

Consider asking for help if you’re struggling with your payments, and you don’t have enough money to put toward a debt avalanche. Nonprofit credit counseling agencies can provide guidance and education to help you take control of your debt. They might even set up a debt management plan (DMP), which can offer relief in the form of lower monthly payments and lower rates. 

Credit counseling agencies typically charge a modest monthly fee for helping you manage your debt.2 

Debt Settlement

Debt settlement is another option, but it’s a more extreme solution. You attempt to pay creditors less than what you owe them with help from a for-profit company, but there’s no guarantee that your lender will be willing to negotiate, and debt settlement programs can lead to lower credit scores. Because the debt settlement process hurts your credit and can take a long time, it's not a recommended approach.3

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is debt avalanche or debt snowball better?

The debt avalanche method is better for making sure you're charged the least amount of interest possible during your debt repayment. The debt snowball method is better if you need small wins to keep you motivated.

Is it better to pay off high-interest debt first?

Generally speaking, yes. It's wise to pay off balances that will cost you more in interest over time.

Debt consolidation is using one loan or credit card to pay off multiple loans or credit cards so you can simplify your debt repayment. With one balance instead of many, it should be easier to pay off your debt and, in some cases, secure a lower interest rate from the lender. Although there are multiple benefits to debt consolidation, there are some drawbacks, too.

What Is Debt Consolidation?

Debt consolidation is combining multiple debts into a single monthly payment by paying them off with a credit card or another type of loan.

How Debt Consolidation Works

Let’s say you have multiple credit card balances and small loans with different interest rates and monthly payments:

Credit card A: $3,500, 24.90% APR
Credit card B: $2,500, 18.90% APR
Credit card C: $1,500, 12.00% APR

Rather than paying these balances individually, you can consolidate all three balances with a single loan that requires one payment instead of three. For example, if you consolidate these balances into a $7,500 loan with 7.00% APR and pay off the loan in four years, you’d pay $1,120.80 in interest. By comparison, if you made a 4% monthly minimum payment on each card, it would take more than $5,440 in interest payments and 12 years to completely pay off the debt.

Note

Your credit score is a factor in qualifying for a low interest rate. If your credit score is higher now than when you applied for your credit cards, you may be able to get a lower rate than what you currently have on your credit card(s).

Types of Debt Consolidation

There are a few methods you can use to consolidate your debt. Your options may be limited, depending on the type of debt, your credit standing, and any real estate assets you have.

Credit Card Balance Transfer

A credit card with a high credit limit and a promotional interest rate on balance transfers is a good candidate for consolidating other high interest rate credit card balances onto a single credit card. Combining your balances under an interest rate that’s lower than the average rate of your existing balances allows you to save money on interest and pay toward one credit card instead of several.

Note

Balance transfers don’t usually count toward any introductory cash, points, or miles bonuses a card offers.

Debt Consolidation Loan

Lenders often offer “debt consolidation” loans which tend to be unsecured personal loans specifically designed for paying off debts. Debt consolidation loans usually have a fixed interest rate and repayment period for more stable repayment terms.

Debt Consolidation Programs

A debt consolidation program, or debt management plan (DMP), is a repayment plan arranged through a credit counseling agency that establishes a new payment schedule and terms that can help you pay down your debt faster and more affordably. It's typically offered to borrowers whom a credit counselor has deemed otherwise unable to repay their loans based on a review of their finances.

A debt management plan generally covers unsecured debt (loans not secured by collateral) such as credit card debt or medical bills but not secured debt, such as mortgages and auto loans.

Student Loan Consolidation 

These loans are specifically for consolidating multiple student loan balances into a single loan with a single monthly payment. This arrangement can be beneficial if you have multiple student loans with different servicers. Student loan consolidation is available for private and federal loans.

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit 

Home equity loans and lines of credit typically allow you to borrow up to 80% to 85% of your home’s equity. The loan option allows you to take out a certain amount of money that you repay via fixed repayments over a set term. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is similar to a credit card in that you have access to the money whenever you need it and only pay interest on the money you actually borrow. Be careful, though: you may have to pay a series of fees to finalize your HELOC. You’ll then take the money from your loan or line of credit and pay off your existing debts, whether credit cards, personal loans, or other borrowed money.1

Note

Home equity loans and lines of credit require you to use your home as collateral. If you don’t pay your loan or line of credit back, you could lose your home through foreclosure.

Cash-Out Mortgage Refinance

Cash-out refinancing is a type of mortgage refinance in which you get a new mortgage that’s more than you owe on your first mortgage. The new mortgage pays off the old one and you get to pocket the difference through a “cash out.” You can use this money to pay off your existing debts, assuming what you’re approved for covers your credit card and loan balances. As a reminder, cash-out refinances typically come with closing costs. 

Does It Cost Money to Consolidate Your Debt?

You may have to pay additional fees, depending on the debt consolidation method you choose. Some typical fees include:

Balance transfer fees for credit cards (usually 3% to 5%)
Origination fees for personal loans used for debt consolidation
Closing costs for mortgage-related loans and lines of credit

The best way to find the loan or line of credit with the lowest rates is to get quotes from multiple lenders and compare the fees. You’ll find that some lenders that offer personal loans for debt consolidation, for example, don’t charge any fees at all while others charge late fees and origination fees.

Pros and Cons of Debt Consolidation

Debt consolidation has both benefits and drawbacks to consider before you make a final decision.

Pros

Easier to manage your expenses by combining multiple debts into a single monthly payment.

Possible lower interest rate

Could lower your overall monthly debt payment

Cons

May not qualify for an interest rate that's lower than your existing balances

Lengthened repayment term could cost more in interest even with a lower rate

Some loans require you to put your home up as collateral

Note

Consolidating your debt doesn’t decrease the amount you owe. It simply restructures your debt into (ideally) a more affordable monthly payment. The trade-off might be a longer repayment period or more interest paid compared to not consolidating.

Alternatives to Debt Consolidation

After reviewing your options, you may decide that debt consolidation isn’t the best way to tackle your debt. Two popular payoff methods that don’t require consolidation are the ""debt snowball"" and ""debt avalanche strategies."" Both focus on paying off your debts one at a time. The debt snowball focuses on paying off your smallest balances first and moving on to bigger balances, while the debt avalanche strategy tackles the balances with the highest interest rates first.

If your situation is more complex, you should consider seeking assistance from a debt relief program. Pursuing debt settlement is a last resort, because it involves stopping payments and working with a firm that holds that money in escrow while negotiating with your creditors to reach a settlement, which can take up to four years. Withholding payments from your creditors can seriously damage your credit score.

Key Takeaways
Debt consolidation, or debt management, allows you to combine multiple debts into a single balance with a single monthly payment.
You may be able to save money on interest or cut down on your repayment time by consolidating your debts.
A debt consolidation loan, home equity loan, or credit card balance transfer are a few methods to consider.
Debt consolidation isn’t always the right choice. Alternatives include the debt snowball or avalanche methods, as well as credit counseling.

Saving money doesn't have to be a numbers game; anyone can accomplish it with proper planning and discipline. Instead of putting off the practice until you reach certain milestones like that next raise, make saving a priority every day to secure your financial future. Follow these money-management tips in your daily life to watch the savings add up.

Key Takeaways
Build a money-management system by evaluating your spending and setting a budget.
Avoid comparing yourself to others and buying based on trends rather than need. 
Pay down debts using the avalanche method. 
Cut expenses by reducing dining out and preparing coffee at home. 
Save money by purchasing groceries in bulk and researching prices before you buy big-ticket items.
Build a Money-Management System

It's easy to blow through your paycheck if there's no rhyme or reason to your spending. Creating a systematic approach to everyday spending and saving through these tips can stretch your dollars further.

Evaluate your spending before building a budget. Document what you buy, where, and in which spending category for 30 days to gauge your spending habits. This approach will ensure that your budget is rooted in reality.
Set a monthly budget. Use budget spreadsheets, software, or old-fashioned pen and paper to plan incoming deposits and outgoing expenses. Once you have established a budget, exercise the discipline needed to stick to it.
Track your spending on an ongoing basis. Schedule a time and day each week to compare your actual spending against your budget to avoid overspending, and realize opportunities to save any extra incoming deposits.
Pay for day-to-day expenses with cash. Evaluate your budget, and determine spending categories you can switch to cash-only payments (for example, entertainment or dining). Whereas credit card payments can tempt you to make impulse buys, cash helps you stick to your budget, because you can't spend any money you don't have.
Note

You can use debit cards in lieu of a cash-only budget if you keep the amount on the card low enough that you can't overspend.

Change Your Mindset About Money

Even with a budget in place, you're liable to slide back into bad money habits if you don't alter your day-to-day spending philosophy. These saving tips can help you replace negative spending behaviors with positive ones.

Don't play the comparison game. Stop ""keeping up with the Joneses"" or with anyone else. Let your budget alone guide your spending and saving habits.
Try to curb emotional spending. Avoid the temptation to buy yourself a ""treat"" when you're upset. When these feelings arise, redirect them toward other positive behaviors that don't require spending money, such as calling a friend or exercising.
Delay gratification. When you get the urge to make an impulse buy, evaluate whether you need or only want the item. If you determine that you need it, wait for one full day before buying it to see whether the item in question still appeals to you.
Don't buy according to trends. Instead, buy what is meaningful to you rather than the highest-priced fad item; you'll be more discerning about your spending, which can save you more money every day.
Pay Down Your Debts

Whether it's a sky-high credit card balance or a bank loan, debt can eat into your cash reserves and make it more difficult to keep up with day-to-day expenses and to save. These debt-management tips encourage you to pay off what you owe so that you can keep more of what you earn.

Pay off debts as soon as possible. This habit can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest over time.
Consult with creditors. If you're in credit card debt, call your creditors and ask them whether they can lower your APR (interest rate).
Pay down your remaining debt using the avalanche method. This approach involves paying the minimum payment on each account and then taking any remaining funds and paying extra on the account with the highest interest rate. High-interest debt can substantially eat into your everyday spending money, so it's prudent to pay it off quickly. The feeling of accomplishment you will get from paying off one debt can motivate you to make progress on other debts.
Set debt-payoff deadlines. Mapping your debt-payoff goals with amounts and a timeline can help you track your progress, remain accountable for actually paying off the debt, and visualize how good it will feel to make that final debt payment.
Consider refinancing your home loan. If you own a home, try to lower your monthly payments by refinancing your mortgage at a lower interest rate.
Note

If you're paying pricier private mortgage insurance (PMI) and think you have enough equity to waive the PMI, call your lender to start that process. In general, you can request PMI cancellation when your mortgage balance drops below 80% of the original home value.1

Insource Everyday Spending

There are many errands you might outsource now but that you could do yourself to reduce living costs. Follow these tips for saving money on day-to-day expenses:

Reduce or eliminate dining out. Cooking more—or all—meals at home can easily save you $100 or more per month.
Prepare coffee at home. Brewing coffee at home instead of buying a three-dollar cup of coffee at a local coffee joint every day can save you over $1,000 a year.
Do your own personal grooming. You'll save a little every month if you skip the trip to the nearby salon to have your hair cut by a stylist or your nails done by a manicurist, and do them yourself (or with the help of a family member or friend). If you cut your hair every other month, you can easily save $250 per year or more in professional hairstylist fees alone.
Clean your car at home. Washing your car on your driveway instead of visiting a drive-through car wash can save you $180 to $360 a year.
Avoid professional dry cleaners. You can save $720 per year in dry-cleaning costs if you switch to wearing machine-washable wrinkle-free shirts.
Adjust Your Shopping Habits

From groceries to gasoline, some purchases are unavoidable. Fortunately, you can save money on day-to-day expenses by using these tips:

Buy in bulk. Buy your groceries in bulk at wholesale stores, including Costco or Sam's Club. Prepare a meal plan once a week so that you buy only what you need.
Shop secondhand. Explore garage sales, thrift stores, eBay, and Craigslist for items you need.
Buy less. When you buy at retail stores, buy fewer items, and focus on purchasing higher-quality items. You'll find over time that quality items actually cost less per use than lower-priced items, because they last much longer and often have classic designs that don't go out of style.
Compare prices. Look up prices online before buying something at a store to determine whether another store sells the same item at a lower price. When shopping online, always check for and use coupon codes.
Borrow instead of buying. Items that you don't need to own to enjoy can be borrowed from friends or neighborhood resources. For example, you can use the library instead of the bookstore to pick up recent books.
Note

Bundling your errands into one long trip per week allows you to save on fuel costs.

Reduce Recurring Costs

Ongoing services such as cellular service or utilities often charge you based on the features you choose or your usage, so they can quickly put a dent in your wallet without your knowing. Use these daily money-saving tips to minimize these repeat expenditures:

Pare down or cancel your cable/satellite TV packages. You can save a bundle every month by switching from your current 500-channels cable package to streaming content providers, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu. If you're not ready to cut the cord, consider switching to a cable package with fewer channels.
Reduce cell phone minutes or data. If you're on a prepaid cell phone plan, change to a plan with the lowest amount of minutes you need. If you're on a postpaid plan, scale back on the data amount. Set an automatic calendar reminder on your phone to check your minute or data usage a few days before the bill is due. That way, you can minimize your usage if needed and avoid overage charges.
Plant trees to reduce cooling bills. Station shade-giving trees around the perimeter of your house to save on the costs of air conditioning during the summer.
Plug appliances into a power strip. Flip the strip's switch off whenever you're not using one of those appliances. You'll save on the cost of ""phantom energy,"" which is the slow drain of energy that stems from keeping things plugged in.
Reconsider that gym membership. Join a gym only if you'll use your membership regularly. There are endless free fitness opportunities, including running, walking, and cycling in your local park.
Tweak the thermostat. Keep your home a little hotter in the summer and a little colder in the winter. Don't feel the need to go overboard; turning the thermostat down by even one degree in winter can yield an energy savings of 1% if the temperature is maintained for eight hours.
Improve the efficiency of your heater. Put an insulation blanket over your water heater to prevent heat from escaping. While you're at it, caulk or weather-seal gaps around your doors and windows to reduce heating bills.
Service and maintain your car. Repairs can easily recur if you don't. Protect your investment.
Get bank account fees waived. Traditional banks charge monthly account-maintenance fees, which can draw down your balance by small amounts over time. However, these fees can often be waived by meeting a certain minimum account balance or minimum monthly deposit. Check the fee schedule so that you can determine how to waive fees.
Save Money in the Future

Whether it's buying a car or deciding where to bank, big financial decisions that you make today can often impact your wallet for months or years. Follow these money-saving tips to make more well-informed choices about where your earnings go:

Go online to spend less on vacation. Use Airbnb or other lodging-rental sites to find vacation rentals for less money than traditional hotel accommodations.
Buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle. Although the fuel savings will help you recover what you paid for the car over time, you can also sell or trade your gas-guzzler to immediately recoup part of the costs. If you live in an area with good public transit, commute on the subway or the bus, or consider becoming a one-car family.
Keep appliance documentation. If you buy a new appliance, keep the warranty certificate (or at the very least, the receipt) in an envelope or file folder that is organized by store or by month. If anything breaks, you'll have proof that your appliance is still under warranty, which could save you hundreds or thousands in repair costs.
Choose a high-interest bank account. Your bank savings account or CD should pay decent interest so that the money in your account earns more over the year. Online banks tend to offer higher interest rates than brick-and-mortar banks do. Interest is important, because it represents free money that grows in your account while you sleep, allowing you to meet your financial goals even sooner.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What kind of savings account earns you the least amount of money?

A standard savings or checking account will earn you the least amount of interest on your savings. The average interest rate for a savings account is less than 0.1%, which means it's unlikely that your interest earnings will keep up with inflation. Checking accounts also yield less than 0.1% on average, even when accounting for high-yield checking accounts.2

Why is saving money important?

Saving money provides financial stability, which can prevent debt spirals in case of unexpected charges, and it can also provide emotional comfort to try out a new career path. It doesn't matter whether you're cutting back on expenses or setting aside more of your income, the key is that you have greater financial flexibility to adapt to life's curveballs.

Carrying a large amount of debt can be crippling, especially if it’s more than you can reasonably afford to pay off. It can overshadow all other financial priorities in your life. The good news is that there are many debt relief programs to help you with overwhelming debt.

As a first step, gain clarity on your financial picture: Understand how much you owe and your current monthly payments for each of your accounts. Then, with a firm grasp on your debt details, you can work toward a strategy to become debt-free. Here’s a look at a few ways you can manage your debt with some help.

Note

Many lenders and credit card issuers are offering programs to assist with debt relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing consumers to skip payments, canceling late fees, lowering interest rates, and more. If you find yourself struggling during the pandemic, don’t hesitate to seek help through one or more avenues.

What Is Debt Relief?

Debt relief is a strategy meant to resolve or deal with a large amount of personal debt. It’s a process of working with your creditors to develop a plan for paying back your debt in a way that will satisfy them, stop the phone calls from collectors, and avoid long-term damage to your credit. Ultimately, it’s a way to reduce your stress and make your debt more manageable.

Note

Every debt relief plan starts by getting a clear view of the debtor’s entire financial picture. Taking practical steps to curb debt can lessen its strain on your mental health, improve cognitive functioning, and reduce stress.

Debt relief doesn’t always mean paying off or forgiving the debt all at once. It can be as simple as negotiating a few skipped payments or a lower interest rate. In many cases, it’s simply a strategy to restructure the debt so the payments are more manageable. This helps the debt holder and satisfies the creditor, which often would rather receive a lower negotiated payment than nothing at all. In extreme circumstances, debt relief may involve filing for bankruptcy.

When To Look for Debt Relief

It’s not always easy to decide when you need help dealing with debt. But there are some common signs to look for that may indicate you’re in over your head:

Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is too high: The amount of your gross income that goes toward debt payments each month is an important number for lenders. Most mortgage lenders won’t give you new credit if your debt payments exceed 43% of your monthly income.1
You can’t get your credit utilization under control: Credit utilization measures your total credit card debt against your limit and makes up 30% of your credit score.2 If you consistently spend more than 30% of your credit limit, your credit score will suffer, and that will make it harder for you to get loans with favorable terms.
You’re paying off credit cards with other credit cards: It’s one thing to transfer a balance occasionally, but if you can’t manage your payments without opening new cards, you may have a problem.

If you feel so overwhelmed by debt that it’s causing significant financial or emotional strain in your life, it’s probably time to seek some help.

Types of Debt Relief Programs

If you decide to seek relief, there are several options for how to handle your debt.

Debt Consolidation Loans

A debt consolidation loan is a type of personal loan that you can use to combine multiple debts into a single balance. The benefit is that you end up with one monthly payment, which can make it easier to stick to a debt payoff plan and slot your debt payment into a monthly budget. Debt-reduction software can help you decide if a consolidation loan makes sense in your situation.

Be aware that you can use your home as collateral for consolidating your debts through a home equity loan or line of credit.

Your credit score may drop in the short term as a new loan is added to your credit report as part of this process. However, your score will improve steadily over the coming months, provided you make your payments on time and don’t add more debt. 

Before you sign on the dotted line, be sure to read the loan’s terms, including its interest rate, its repayment period, and any fees. Debt consolidation loans’ interest rates range from around 6% to nearly 36%. 

Debt Management Plans

A debt management plan facilitated by a nonprofit credit counselor is another option. A credit counselor will help organize your finances and help you develop a debt payoff plan if you really need one. They may help you negotiate with your creditors to get better rates or extend your payment period.3

Credit counseling can provide some much-needed accountability and structure for your debt relief program. Be sure to ask about any fees before you start. If their rates are only going to add more financial burden, or if they are making money by referring you to other services, consider another organization. In addition, confirm that your counselor is from an accredited nonprofit organization and that they don’t push debt consolidation plans as the only option for debt relief.

Note

Working with a nonprofit credit counselor—even when that includes a debt management plan—usually won’t affect your credit score unless you’ve negotiated a settlement. You might see a minor impact from closing accounts, but your score will rebound over time.

Debt Settlement Programs

Debt settlement companies are another type of debt relief program that generally should be avoided.These companies collect payments from you each month and hold the funds in an account. Once you’ve accumulated a certain amount, the debt settlement firm approaches your creditors to negotiate a settlement on your account. 

Under debt settlement, you may pay expensive service fees and suffer damage to your credit if you follow advice to stop making payments on accounts that are in good standing.4 There’s no guarantee the debt settlement firm will be able to reach an agreement with your creditors. If you have accounts that are already past due or in collections, you can negotiate a settlement on your own, without paying a third party.

Balance Transfer Credit Cards

If a large chunk of your debt is made up of credit card debt, then a balance transfer may be your best approach for credit debt relief. A substantial amount of credit card debt usually means you’re paying quite a bit in interest, because the average credit card annual percentage rate (APR) is just above 20%. This is especially true if you’re paying only your card’s minimum payment.

Transferring your credit card debt to a low or zero-APR balance transfer credit card is a good way to get a jump on paying down your balances. Be aware that most balance transfers come with a fee, usually a small percentage of the transferred amount, and that the introductory interest rate only lasts a limited time.

To get the most benefit from a balance transfer, you need to pay the transferred balance before the introductory rate period ends. Additionally, you should avoid adding new debt on top of your transferred debt.

Filing for Bankruptcy

After you’ve been struggling with debt for some time, bankruptcy can sometimes feel like the best option. After all, it will eliminate your debt and allow you to start over with a clean slate. However, bankruptcy can have long-term effects on your finances and your credit. Not only can the filing cause your credit score to drop dramatically, but the bankruptcy will stay on your financial record for up to 10 years. This likely means it will take some time to qualify for new loans or receive favorable terms.

There are two types of personal bankruptcy: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Filing for Chapter 7 will eliminate all your debt, but it also will liquidate your other assets, apart from some exempt property. Then the proceeds will go toward your debt. With Chapter 13 bankruptcy, your debts are repaid with a three- to five-year payment plan, which tends to be strict and needs to be approved in a bankruptcy court.5 Filing bankruptcy can be costly as you may need to hire an attorney to help you file.

Note

Filing bankruptcy should be your last resort when considering debt relief options. Always talk with an attorney to discuss all of your choices before going this route.

The Bottom Line

While your debt may feel overwhelming, just choosing a debt relief option can help you gain more control of your finances.

No matter which option you choose, be sure you know all the stipulations and can afford to make your new committed payments. Don’t neglect other areas of your finances—creating a budget and building an emergency fund protect you from more debt problems and establish a healthy financial foundation.

Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Best Way to Set a Budget?

Different methods might be best for different people. For example, many computer programs can help track income and expenses, and they even can be connected to your financial accounts to automatically import data. Others might want to handle the process manually. Regardless, the important thing to do is to set a budget so you can know exactly where you stand with your finances.

What Are the Keys to Managing Personal Finances?

Be as detailed as possible when managing your personal finances. Sticking to a budget, paying down debt, and knowing exactly where every dollar is going can help make it possible to increase your savings. Having the details to find that extra $10 or $20 per week or month that you can save or invest today can add up to thousands of dollars years from now.

What Are the Key Elements of Financial Planning?

Budgeting is a big part of financial planning. To be successful, it is important to account for everything necessary to financial health. In addition to simply knowing your income and expenses, you have to think about where you will be in the future with income and expenses. Insurance, a good investment plan, and more can help you with expected and unexpected expenses that may arise.

DEFINITION

A budget is a written plan that outlines how you’ll spend your money each month.

Key Takeaways
A budget is a written plan that outlines how you’ll spend your money each month.
Both individuals and businesses use budgets to manage their cash flow and reach their goals.
A budget is important because it shows you how much money you make each month and how you’re spending that money. 
Some popular types of budgets include the 50/30/20 budget, the 80/20 budget, the envelope budget, and the zero-based budget.




Definition and Examples of a Budget

A budget is a financial planning tool in which you write down how much money you expect to earn (i.e. your income) and how you plan on using it (i.e. your expenses). Individuals and businesses alike use budgets to track their cash flow and reach their goals. 

Alternate name: Spending plan

One popular budgeting method is the 50/30/20 budget. You use 50% of your income for needs (such as rent and utilities), 30% for wants (such as shopping and eating out), and 20% for savings (such as an emergency fund, paying down debt, or building up your retirement fund).1

How Does a Budget Work?

The purpose of a budget is to help you track your spending so you can use your money to reach your goals. 

“Budgeting helps you decide upfront how to spend your money,” said R.J. Weiss, CFP and founder of The Ways to Wealth. “Everyone has different priorities and goals. By budgeting, you're making sure your priorities and goals are being put ahead of expenses that aren’t as important.”

After you set up your budget, one of three things will happen:  

You’ll have a balanced budget: This means your income equals your expenses and you aren’t spending more money than you make. 
You’ll have a deficit: This means you’re spending more than you make and possibly going into debt. 
You’ll have a surplus: This means you’re spending less than you earn. You can use the extra money to save, pay off debt, and reach your goals.  

Here’s a closer look at how a budget works for individuals and businesses: 

Personal Budgets

The whole point of a personal budget is to help you spend less than you earn so you can use the difference to reach your savings goals. In its simplest form, a personal budget works like this:

At the beginning of each month, you create a written plan for how you’ll spend your income. 

Next, record your expenses at the end of every day to track your progress. (A spreadsheet or budgeting app can be helpful here.) Your expenses will likely fall into one of three categories: 

Fixed expenses: These expenses cost the same amount of money every month and are typically non-negotiable. Some examples are rent or a mortgage, car insurance, your phone bill, and some utilities. 
Variable expenses: These expenses are necessary, but the cost varies month to month. Examples include groceries, electricity, transportation costs, and vehicle maintenance. 
Discretionary expenses: These expenses are 100% fun and optional. They include anything from clothing and new gadgets to vacations and entertainment purchases.

Finally, at the end of each month, you review your progress and use this month’s spending to plan next month’s budget.  

Personal Budget Example
Starting monthly income	$4,000
Rent	$1,700
Phone bill	$70
Health and Car Insurance	$100
Car loan	$350
Gas	$135
Groceries	$400
Takeout food	$200
Clothing and beauty supplies	$220
Entertainment	$100
Subscription services	$150
Miscellaneous expenses	$75
Debt payments and bank fees	$700
Ending monthly budget	-$200

Your income is higher than your expenses, so you have a deficit budget. You already had a gut feeling this was true because you couldn’t pay your bills on time. But now, thanks to your budget, you know exactly where your money is going each month.

You need to free up at least $200 in your budget, so you start trimming expenses on takeout food, clothing, entertainment, and subscriptions—all things you want to spend money on but you can’t necessarily afford right now. 

You cut $50 from your takeout food budget, another $50 from subscriptions, $40 from entertainment, and you cut your clothing budget in half to free up another $110. 

Before you know it, you have an extra $250 in your budget. You put $200 of it toward bills and use the other $50 to start an emergency fund so you have a safety net to protect you from unexpected expenses.

Types of Budgets

There are almost as many types of budgets as there are flavors of ice cream. Consider trying out a few different types of budgets until you find which “flavor” you like best. 

Envelope Budget

With the envelope budgeting method, you set spending limits for each of your budgeting categories and put that amount of cash in a physical envelope to help track your spending. Once you empty one envelope, that category is off-limits until you get paid again. 

50/30/20 Budget

With the 50/30/20 budget rule, you spend 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and debt repayments. So, if your take-home pay is $5,000 a month, you’d spend:

$2,500 on housing, transportation, and other necessities (50%)
$1,500 on fun things like dining out, shopping, and subscriptions (30%)
$1,000 to pay off debt and reach your savings goals (20%)1
80/20 Budget

If you don’t like the idea of having to figure out what’s a “need” and what’s a “want,” consider the 80/20 method. With this budgeting rule, you save 20% of your income and use the other 80% however you’d like. 

Keep in mind, the 20% savings rate is just a guideline. You can change it to be a 70/30 budget, a 60/40 budget—whatever works best for you. This method is also called the “pay-yourself-first” budget or the “reverse budget.”2

Zero-Based Budget

A zero-based budget is a strategy where you give every dollar a job so your income minus expenses equals zero. It’s not to say you spend every penny you own. Rather, you go ahead and divide your paycheck out among all your expenses, debt payoff, and financial goals so there’s none left over.2

Do I Need a Budget?

Yes. A budget is important because it helps you pay your bills on time and save for the future. It also helps you find ways to spend less money on things you don’t value so you have more money to put toward your goals—such as saving for retirement, a vacation, a house, or a new car.

Everyone can benefit from a budget, no matter how small or large your income is. Without one, it’s hard to know where your money is going each month. 

Note

If the idea of manually creating a budget each month sounds tiring, give a budgeting app a try. These apps take the load off by syncing to your financial accounts and automatically importing and categorizing transactions for you.

How To Create a Budget

Whether for personal or business use, here’s how you’d go about creating a budget: 

1. Add Up Your Monthly Income

First things first, you need to figure out how much money you make each month. Use your net take-home pay for this step, which is the amount of money you bring home after taxes and deductions. 

If you earn a salary, you can find your net take-home pay by looking at your paystubs. If you have irregular income, add up all the money you made last year and divide it by 12. This will give you an estimate to work with.

Don’t forget to include any other sources of income, such as Social Security, child support, side hustles, and more.

Note

Looking for a free budgeting template? The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers a simple but effective template.  

2. Estimate Your Monthly Expenses

Now it’s time to calculate your spending. Dig through your old bank and credit card statements to see how much money you spend each month. Some common expenses to add to your budget include: 

Rent or mortgage payments
Utilities (gas, water, electricity, sewage)
Internet and cable
Cell phone bill
Groceries and take out
Health expenses
Transportation costs
Education and childcare costs
Pet costs
Debt payments

“If you're brand new to budgeting, consider budgeting just one spending category over the next month,” Weiss said. “For best results, pick a category you tend to overspend, such as eating out, grocery shopping, or entertainment. The idea is to start small, to give yourself the highest possible chance of success. From there, you'll gain confidence and skill in your ability to budget, and be able to apply it to other areas.”

Note

Don’t forget about budgeting for seasonal expenses. If you want to save up for holiday expenses, make sure you add a “Holiday expenses” line to your budget for August through December. Doing so will give you time to save up what you need for presents, parties, and other expenses.

3. Subtract Your Expenses From Your Income

Once you subtract your expenses from your income, you’ll have a better idea of if you’re living within your means or taking on more debt. 

If your income is higher than your expenses: You have money left to save or spend. Consider putting some of this money toward the financial goals you set in Step 4.
If you broke even: You’re living within your means, but just barely. Ideally, you want some extra money left over each month to put toward your financial goals. See if there are a few expenses you can trim to give yourself a buffer to work with each month. 
If your expenses are higher than your income: You’re spending more than you make. Look for ways to trim expenses or increase your income. 
4. Build Some Financial Goals Into Your Budget

As you build out your budget, incorporate some financial goals you’d like to reach in the coming months or years. For example, you could create budgeting categories for goals such as: 

An emergency fund
Down payment on a house
Security deposit on a new apartment
New car
Vacation
Kid’s college fund
Extra debt payments
5. Make Adjustments as You Go

Your life is dynamic and constantly changing, so your budget should be, too. When you get a new job, add a new expense, or earn a bonus, adjust your budget to reflect the changes. 

As you move throughout the month, track your spending and make adjustments as needed. If you consistently overspend in one budget area, you may want to move money from another spending area to cover the difference. 

“There is no one perfect way to budget,” Weiss said. “It's important to go in with the expectation that budgeting is a skill that takes practice. You'll likely fail in month one, but what's important is you take what you learned and apply it down the road.”

Debt relief takes several forms, including debt consolidation, debt management, debt settlement, and bankruptcy. All of these approaches are aimed at easing your financial burdens and ideally becoming debt-free. One approach may be a better fit for your situation than another, so it’s important to carefully weigh your debt relief options.

Keep reading to learn how to get debt relief. 

How To Get Debt Relief

To get debt relief, you should:

Gather financial documents. At minimum you’ll need credit card and bank statements and copies of recent paychecks.
Assess your financial situation. Add up what you owe, what you spend, and what you make, and determine the shortfall.
Review your debt relief options. You might consider debt consolidation, debt management, debt settlement, and bankruptcy.
Research providers and apply. Compare fees and other requirements for participating in a debt relief program.
When Is It a Good Idea To Seek Debt Relief?

It’s a good idea to seek debt relief if you’re struggling to manage your finances, or you’re failing to keep up with credit card bills and other debt payments. Signs that you might need to pursue debt relief include:1

You’re being pestered by creditors or collection agencies about past-due payments.
You’re constantly dipping into savings to cover debt payments.
You’re regularly being rejected for loans and credit cards.
You’re taking on extra work to pay your bills.
You’re dealing with a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) higher than 43%. To calculate your DTI, divide your monthly debt payments by your monthly gross income.
Note

People who are saddled with a lot of debt often are the targets of debt settlement scams. In some cases, scammers may ask for an upfront fee but then provide little to no help. Experts advise against paying upfront fees to debt settlement companies.2

What follows are four ways to seek debt relief.

Types of Debt Relief
Debt Consolidation

Debt consolidation involves rolling several debts, such as credit card bills or personal loan payments, into one monthly payment. Your options for debt consolidation include a balance transfer credit card, a debt consolidation loan, or a home equity loan.

Pros

Provides one monthly payment for several combined debts

Potentially offers interest savings on consolidated debts

Possibly reduces your credit utilization ratio, which makes up 30% of a FICO credit score

Cons

Might not resolve your issues with debt management, such as overspending

May involve temporary rates for no-interest or low-interest debt consolidation products

Might jeopardize your credit score or, in the case of a home equity loan, your house due to missed payments

Debt Management

A credit counseling agency can help put you on a debt management plan.

One of the agency’s counselors will act as a middleman between you and your creditors to come up with a plan for paying back money you owe. In some cases, a creditor may reduce the interest rate you’re paying.

Under a debt management plan, you deposit money each month into an account maintained by the credit counseling agency. The agency then sends payments to your creditors, such as credit card issuers, lenders, and health care providers. You remain on the plan (typically for three to five years) until your debts are paid off.

Pros

Creates one monthly payment for several consolidated debts

Might lead to lower interest rates

May improve your credit score

Cons

Demands closure of all credit card accounts that are part of your debt management plan

Requires consistent monthly payments to maintain the plan’s benefits

May not include all of your creditors

Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies, also known as debt relief companies, renegotiate debts owed to creditors or debt collectors. However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns that working with a debt settlement company can be risky.3 For instance, once your credit report reflects that you’re settling some of your debt, your credit score could drop by 100 to 125 points.4

The Federal Trade Commission cautions that you must “watch out for dishonest debt settlement companies that make promises they can’t keep, charge you a lot of money, and then do little or nothing to help you.”5

Pros

May enable payoff of debts in two to four years

Eliminates need to file for bankruptcy

May avoid lawsuits from creditors or debt collectors

Cons

Involves high fees for debt settlement services (perhaps $500 to $3,000 or more)

Possibly causes damage to your credit score

Not all debts may qualify

Bankruptcy

If a consumer with a heavy load of debt files for bankruptcy, they typically file for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.6 It’s a legal maneuver designed to help someone saddled by debt get a fresh start. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy case wipes out most of your debts, while a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case sets up a court-approved repayment plan.

But of all the debt relief options available, bankruptcy may carry the biggest consequences. One of the key drawbacks: A Chapter 7 bankruptcy might remain on your credit report for up to 10 years, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy for up to seven years.7 

Pros

Offers ability to keep many of your assets

Halts debt collections and property repossessions

Prevents debt collectors from suing you for nonpayment

Cons

Stays on your credit report for up to 10 years

Limits ability to obtain credit

Might exclude certain debts

What You Need To Seek Debt Relief

What you need to seek debt relief varies depending on the method of debt relief you choose. Generally, though, you’ll need to:

Assemble financial documents, such as credit card statements, loan statements, and bank statements.
Figure out how much debt you have.
Review the interest rates for your debts.
Determine which debt relief option would be best for you. Are your finances in good enough shape that debt management is the right way to go? Or is a last-resort bankruptcy filing the best alternative?
Research the debt relief option that you’ve picked. For instance, what are the eligibility requirements for any credit counseling agencies that you’re considering?
Choosing a Debt Relief Program and Applying for Debt Relief

As you’re deciding on a debt relief program, be sure to look into:

Fees: This is especially important if you’re using the services of a debt settlement company, as their fees can be especially high.
Company reputation: Has the program been around a long time? What do online reviewers say about it? Is it in good standing with the Better Business Bureau?
Customer service: Has the program’s customer service gained lots of compliments or complaints?
Documents required: For example, if you file for bankruptcy, the court typically wants to see documents such as income tax returns, proof of income, credit card statements, loan statements, bank statements and retirement statements.
Note

Be aware that if you do business with a debt settlement company, you may be charged a fee equaling 15% to 25% of the total debt being settled. Debt settlement fees, which might exceed $3,000, tend to be much higher than fees connected with other debt relief options. Keep in mind that debt settlement companies can’t collect fees before settling your debts.

Beware of Debt Relief Scams

Plenty of debt relief companies and organizations are on the up and up. Unfortunately, some of them prey on desperate people. Here are four red flags to watch to help prevent being trapped in a debt relief scam:8

It reaches out to you first: If you didn’t initiate the contact with a debt relief provider, you could be the target of a scam.
It requests upfront fees: If a company or organization asks for fees before offering help, it’s likely that you’re dealing with a scammer.
It makes promises that sound too good to be true: For instance, a fraudulent debt relief company might claim it can work out a one-time settlement to slash your debt by at least 50%. However, that sort of outlandish promise likely won’t be kept.9
It claims that signing up for its program will take care of all your problems: No company or organization can guarantee that all your debts can be paid off for mere pennies on the dollar or will vanish altogether.10

Alternatives to Debt Relief

If you’re looking for relief from debts, your options aren’t limited to what falls under the debt relief umbrella. Here are three alternatives.

Try DIY debt negotiation. Instead of depending on a company or organization to help resolve your debt situation, you might look into negotiating with creditors on your own. For instance, you may be able to work out an arrangement with a creditor to lower your interest rate or your monthly payments.
Meet with a financial planner. A financial planner or another financial professional should be able to help you get a handle on your finances by coming up with debt management strategies.
Stick to a budget. Taming your debt may be as simple as developing a budget and following it religiously. You might consider leaning on technology, such as a budgeting app or a spreadsheet, to track your income and expenses.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you qualify for debt relief?

How you qualify for debt relief depends on the debt relief option you pick. For instance, National Debt Relief, a debt settlement company, requires that you have at least $7,500 in debt and be able to make monthly payments into a settlement fund to qualify for its services.

How long does debt relief take?

Debt relief done through a debt settlement company may take two to three years. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy process may last anywhere from four months to five years, depending on whether you’re seeking Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And a debt management plan may take three to five years to complete.

Does debt relief hurt your credit?

Pretty much any debt relief approach will likely hurt your credit, at least for a short period of time. Bankruptcy usually has the longest-lasting impact, though, as it may stay on your credit report for up to 10 years. According to credit-scoring company FICO, someone with spotless credit and a very high score could see a “huge drop” in their FICO score after a bankruptcy. On the other hand, someone who already had a lot of negative marks on their credit report might see only a “modest drop” in their FICO score following a bankruptcy.

Can debt be forgiven?

Yes, debt can be forgiven. This means that a creditor declares you’re not responsible for paying back some or all of your debt. Debt forgiveness often is associated with debt settlement. Among the types of debts that might be forgiven are credit cards and student loans.

If you have room in your budget (or a lump sum of cash), making extra mortgage payments may help you in several ways. You can save a substantial amount in interest, and eliminating debt provides flexibility in life.

However, paying extra on your mortgage isn’t the only way to reach your financial goals, and it might not always be the right move. Here's what you need to know before making extra mortgage payments.

Key Takeaways
Making extra mortgage payments can reduce interest costs, lower debt, and save thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.
Make extra payments through lump sum payments or by adding money to your mortgage payment each month.
Be sure to check with your mortgage lender to see if there's a specific way you need to send extra payments to ensure they are applied to your principal balance.
Why Make Extra Mortgage Payments?

As long as you're honoring your existing mortgage payments, you shouldn't feel obliged to use any extra cash to pay down the mortgage. That said, doing so does offer some significant benefits, and it could ultimately save you money in the long run.

Reduce Interest Costs

Although mortgage loans usually have relatively low-interest rates, the loan balances are significant. Over time, you pay a surprising amount of interest, and most of your interest costs come in the early years of a long-term loan.

Eliminate Debt

In addition to saving money, you buy flexibility when you pay down debt. With your mortgage loan paid off, it’s easier to go into retirement on a fixed income or start a business without worrying about monthly payments. Being debt-free provides the freedom to choose different paths in life.

As an example, assume you get a $200,000 30-year fixed-rate loan at 4.1%. Your monthly payment is $966.40.

Interest savings: Over the life of your loan, you pay nearly $148,000 in interest costs. That’s in addition to the $200,000 loan (the ""principal"") that you have to repay. However, if you pay an extra $100 per month, you’d save roughly $28,000 in interest costs.
Early payoff: By paying an additional $100 per month, you pay off your loan approximately five years early. For those remaining five years, you can redirect that money toward other goals. Or you could choose to work less because you won’t need as much income.

Even if you don’t stay in the same home for 25 years, a 25-year habit of paying extra should bring similar benefits. You’ll spend less on interest and you’ll have more equity for your next home purchase.

To see exactly how much you can save, run detailed calculations for your loan with a loan payoff calculator (see below).

Note

An additional reason to consider making extra mortgage payments is to eliminate Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) requirements. In general, consumers can cancel PMI if they have made additional payments that reduce the debt obligation to 80% of the original value of the home.1

How to Make Extra Payments

You can send extra money to your mortgage lender in several ways. Choosing a strategy mostly comes down to personal preference, but you may find more benefits to one strategy over another.

Monthly Payments

If you prefer to make it a monthly habit, add a little extra to each monthly payment. You can typically instruct your lender to pull an additional amount electronically, or you can send a check. This approach allows you to fit extra mortgage payments into your monthly budget and steadily chip away at your loan balance.

Lump-Sum Payments

Whenever you have significant savings in cash, you can put that money toward your mortgage. Some people like to make one additional mortgage payment per year. For example, they copy the amount of their standard monthly payment and make 13 payments per year instead of 12. Others prefer to use a sudden influx of money, such as a bonus or inheritance, to pay down debt instead of spending it frivolously.

Note

Ask your lender what your options are and make sure any additional payments go toward reducing your loan balance. You may need to follow specific steps or provide instructions to your lender.

Most mortgage loans allow for prepayment, whether you add to your monthly payment, make lump sum payments, or pay off the loan entirely. But verify that you won’t cause any problems by paying extra. Ask about prepayment penalties and any other complications that could arise if you try to pay off your loan early.

Other Ideas for Extra Cash

It’s rarely a bad idea to pay off debt, but sometimes there are better options, and sometimes your mortgage isn't your most important debt to reduce.

Extra payments provide the benefits described above, but you lock that money up in your home’s equity. If you need funds at some point, it can be hard to get the money back. You typically need to use a home equity loan, and that approval process requires sufficient income and credit scores. You can't depend on home equity for cash if you suddenly need it.

Evaluate your needs, and decide how best to use any extra money you have available.

High-Interest Debt

If you have other loans with toxic interest rates, it may make more sense to pay off those loans aggressively. For example, the average credit card interest rate is over 20%. If your mortgage interest rate is significantly lower (which is usually the case), you can potentially save more by wiping out those expensive debts first.

15-Year Mortgages

Another way to slash interest costs and pay off debt sooner is to use a shorter-term mortgage. Although 30-year loans are popular, other options exist, including 15-year mortgages.2 In most cases, with a shorter loan term, you qualify for a lower interest rate. As a result, you pay at a lower rate over fewer years.

Build an Emergency Fund

You may have extra money now, but are you on a stable financial footing? Roughly 25% of Americans wouldn't be able to cover an unexpected $400 expense with cash or cash-like payments.3 If that describes your situation, you might be better off putting extra money toward an emergency fund.

As mentioned above, your home's equity isn't easily or quickly tapped into. It’s wise to keep at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in a safe place, just in case the unexpected happens. If you prefer to be extra cautious, save even more. Doing so allows you to absorb financial surprises without going into debt or making drastic sacrifices. Once you have a healthy emergency fund, you can feel more confident in your decision to pay down the mortgage.

Save for Other Goals

Instead of paying off debt, you may want to make progress on long-term financial goals. If you’re investing for retirement or accumulating funds for education, a steady flow of contributions helps you build up significant assets over time. You may find that it's easier to build wealth by focusing on investments and sticking with a longer timeline for your mortgage payments.
