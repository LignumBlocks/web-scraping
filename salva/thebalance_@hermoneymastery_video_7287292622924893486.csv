Savings accounts let you deposit and withdraw as much money as you want, typically whenever you want (some banks restrict certain types of withdrawals to six per month). A no-penalty CD is often seen as a way to earn a slightly higher interest rate than with a savings account, but in turn, you're much more limited as to when you can make deposits and withdrawals. If you're trying to decide between the two, we'll help by highlighting some important differences.

What’s the Difference Between No-Penalty CDs and Savings Accounts?
 	SAVINGS ACCOUNTS	NO-PENALTY CDS
APY	Usually slightly lower	Usually slightly higher
CHANGING APYS	Can change at any time	Does not change 
LIMITS ON DEPOSITS	No limits; whenever you want, in any amount	Once open, you can’t deposit any more money
LIMITS ON WITHDRAWALS	Six withdrawals per month, in any amount	No withdrawals are allowed until the term ends or you make an early withdrawal
AVAILABILITY	Available at any bank or credit union	Less commonly available
APY: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

Both savings accounts and no-penalty CDs are usually some of the lowest-yield accounts at banks and credit unions. The interest rates on no-penalty CDs are often a tad higher than with savings accounts, however.

If earning the best rates on your savings while keeping it readily available is your goal, look for an online bank or credit union. The difference between the rates that online and brick-and-mortar financial institutions offer is generally larger than the difference between interest rates on savings accounts and no-penalty CDs within the same bank.

Changing APYs: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

One of the benefits of a traditional, fixed-rate CD is that once it's open, the rate doesn't change (unless you have a bump-up CD or a step-up CD).1 This can be handy if you think rates are high now but will go down soon. It lets you lock in a better rate today than you might get in the future with a savings account.

If you have a savings account, on the other hand, your rate can change at any time.2 If rates go down, you'll earn less interest—but if rates go up, you'll earn more.

Limits on Deposits: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

There are no limits on savings accounts for how often you can make deposits, or how much they have to be. Still, it's good to be aware that some banks have minimum balance limits. These tend to be more common on higher-yield savings accounts. If you're a super-squirreler, it's also good to keep your savings account balance below $250,000, the limit for FDIC insurance.3

When you open a no-penalty CD, on the other hand, it's meant to be a hands-off savings account. Once you open the account, you can't make any additional deposits until the account is closed, either because its term ended or you withdrew the money early. At that point, the only thing you can do is open another CD.4

Limits on Withdrawals: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

No-penalty CDs are much more restrictive when it comes to withdrawals. You can only make one withdrawal, and when you do, you must withdraw the entire CD balance. Normally, CDs charge you an early withdrawal penalty, but with a no-penalty CD, you don't have to pay this fee.5

Savings accounts, on the other hand, are more flexible. You can make up to six withdrawals per month for the most common types of withdrawals, which include things such as ACH transfers, bill payment services, and overdraft protection transfers.6 When you make these withdrawals, you can withdraw any amount you want, from one cent all the way to your entire balance.

Note

The monthly limit of six withdrawals per month from a savings account has been suspended due to COVID. As of publication, it hasn't been reinstated yet.7

Availability: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

Savings accounts, along with checking accounts, are the twin pillars of any person's financial toolkit. You can find checking accounts and savings accounts at just about any bank or credit union.

If you're interested in a no-penalty CD, however, you'll have to look a bit harder. Since they're a bit more unique, they're not offered at every bank or credit union. If you want to keep all your bank accounts with the same institution, look for a bank that offers a no-penalty CD first. Otherwise, you may need to open a separate no-penalty CD account with a different institution than your everyday bank.

Which Is Right for Me?

Savings accounts and no-penalty CDs are great ways to save, and determining which one is best for you depends on your financial goals and intended usage. Here are some questions to ask yourself that can steer you toward one option or the other:

Do I have a lump sum of money I won't need for a bit? Since you can't make regular deposits and withdrawals from a no-penalty CD, a savings account would be a better option if you're still working on saving up.
Do I want to lock in my rate now? If you think rates will be going down soon, a no-penalty CD can allow you to lock in the rate that's currently being offered for a bit longer.
Do I want the most convenient option? You'll need to search a bit more to find a no-penalty CD, and chances are you'll have to open it at a different bank than the one that houses your traditional accounts. If you don't want that hassle, choose a savings account.
Do I want to earn the most interest and still have access to my money? No-penalty CDs usually offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, but this isn't always the case.
Best-of-Both-Worlds Option

You don't necessarily have to choose between a savings account and a no-penalty CD. You can open both types of accounts if you wish.

If you've already built up enough savings to meet the minimum opening requirements for a no-penalty CD, you can open this account and let it sit while you keep making regular deposits to your savings account. When your no-penalty CD matures, you can roll it over into a new one with the savings you've built up in the meantime.

The Bottom Line

You're not alone if you're trying to figure out how to earn the highest rates of return from your savings while still having access to your cash. It might be worth considering other options, such as money market accounts or even CD ladder strategies, which tend to offer higher rates.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Which offers higher rates—a no-penalty CD, or a savings account?

Often, no-penalty CDs have slightly higher interest rates than savings accounts, but that's not always true. Sometimes, they're the same. Online banks and credit unions generally offer much higher rates on both savings accounts and no-penalty CDs than brick-and-mortar banks.

What's the difference between a savings account, a CD, and a no-penalty CD?

A savings account lets you deposit and withdraw money without restrictions. With a CD, you can't deposit more money or make withdrawals until its term is over, unless you pay an early withdrawal fee. If you do, you have to withdraw the entire balance, even if you don't need it all. No-penalty CDs waive the early withdrawal penalty, but they often offer slightly lower rates than regular CDs.

Certificates of deposit (CDs) and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) can help you earn money with your money. However, IRAs are long-term investment accounts that offer tax advantages and help you fund your retirement, whereas CDs are usually short-term investments that provide modest returns and mature after five years or less. Learn more about the differences between a CD and an IRA, and when you might choose one over the other.

Key Takeaways
CDs is a kind of savings-style account that typically have terms of five years or less and earn low interest rates.
IRAs are retirement accounts that are more complex than CDs.
You can deposit more into a CD in one year than you can in an IRA.
CDs can work for short-term savings goals, but IRAs tend to be a better fit for a long-term retirement plan.




What’s the Difference Between IRAs and CDs?
 	CD	IRA
Account type	Specialized savings account	Retirement investment account
How it works	You deposit a fixed amount of money for a set term to earn interest.	You hold investments such as bonds, stocks, and exchange-traded funds in the IRA and receive tax advantages.

Tax benefits	No	Yes
Income limits	No	Yes, for some IRAs
Account Type

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of savings account in which you deposit a fixed amount of money for a fixed term to earn interest. An IRA is a retirement account that offers tax advantages and can hold a variety of investments, which can include CDs, stocks, bonds, and more.

How It Works

With a CD, you earn interest by leaving your deposit in the account for a set period, known as a term. When the account matures, or reaches the end of the term, you get your deposit back plus the interest your money earned.

An IRA acts as a basket that holds your investments, which can include CDs, stocks, bonds, and more. However, you can’t hold life insurance or collectibles in an IRA.1 You’ll let your investments grow until you retire, when you’ll begin to make withdrawals from your IRA.

Terms

CDs have terms that usually range from one month to five years or longer.2 With most kinds of CDs, you generally can’t access your money until the end of the term.

Because IRAs are designed as retirement savings accounts, you’ll need to wait until you’re at least age 59½ to withdraw money. You can withdraw funds before that age, but early distributions may be taxed and you may pay a 10% penalty fee.3

Note

You’re typically required to start taking withdrawals from a traditional IRA when you reach age 72.4

Types

Both CDs and IRAs come in a variety of types. The main types of CDs include:

Traditional CD: Traditional CDs have fixed terms and guaranteed interest rates if you keep your deposit in the account until it matures.
High-yield CD: High-yield CDs are like traditional CDs, but offer higher-than-average interest rates.
Market-linked CD: Instead of offering a fixed interest rate, a market-linked CD offers a variable rate based on market measures such as commodities or indexes.
Jumbo CD: Jumbo CDs require a large minimum deposit, such as $100,000.
Liquid CD: Also known as no-penalty CDs, liquid CDs don’t have early withdrawal penalties, so you can access your money before the end of the term without incurring a fee.
Brokered CD: Brokered CDs are sold by financial intermediaries instead of directly by banks or credit unions.
Add-on CD: Add-on CDs allow you to continuously add funds to your CD throughout your term.
Note

You might also come across an IRA CD, which is a CD held in an IRA.

IRAs also come in a range of options:

Traditional IRA: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, and your qualified distributions are taxed at the time of withdrawal.
Roth IRA: With Roth IRAs, your contributions aren’t tax-deductible, but your qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
SEP IRA: A SEP IRA is a Simplified Employee Pension plan that lets business owners contribute to retirement plans for themselves and their employees.
Payroll deduction IRA: Payroll deduction IRAs enable employees to have their IRA contributions automatically deducted from their paychecks.
SIMPLE IRA: A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA is a plan that lets employers and employees contribute to traditional IRAs for employees.
Self-directed IRA: Self-directed IRAs let you invest in a broader set of assets than traditional IRAs.
Early Withdrawal Penalties

Penalties for an early withdrawal apply to both CDs and IRAs. With CDs, you’ll often face an early withdrawal penalty if you remove money from the account before the maturity date. For example, a bank may charge you three months of interest if you withdraw money from the CD.

If you withdraw any amount from an IRA before turning 59½ years old, you’ll often be charged a 10% tax penalty and be required to include the distribution in your gross income.5

Minimum Deposits

Both CDs and IRAs can have minimum deposit requirements. However, these will depend on the financial institution you choose.

Maximum Deposits

The bank or credit union issuing your CD will limit how much you are allowed to deposit. For example, a bank might allow you to deposit up to $2 million, not including interest.6

When it comes to IRAs, deposits are limited by the IRS, which sets a maximum contribution limit each year. In tax year 2022, you can’t contribute more than $6,000 if you’re under 50 years old, or more than $7,000 if you’re 50 or older. Those limits are $6,500 and $7,500 in 2023.7

Note

You can’t contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year. Depending on your type of IRA, your filing status and income may also result in a reduced contribution limit.7

Federal Insurance

Both CDs and the accounts held in IRAs can be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA) up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. That means deposits owned by the same person at the same bank or credit union are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. IRAs and savings accounts (such as CDs) count toward separate $250,000 totals.8

You may notice that $250,000 is less than the maximum deposit allowed by some financial institutions. That means any deposits over $250,000 wouldn’t be insured.

Tax Benefits

Traditional CDs don’t come with any special tax benefits. Any interest you earn counts as taxable income in the year you receive it.

IRAs offer tax advantages that vary based on the type of IRA you choose. For example, traditional IRA contributions may be partially or fully tax-deductible, and you’re only taxed when you withdraw money in retirement. Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible, but qualified distributions are tax-free.

Income Limits

Issuers of CDS don’t typically have any income limits for depositors.

However, with Roth IRAs, your contribution limit can be affected by your income and filing status. For example, if you’re married filing jointly and made $214,000 or more in tax year 2022, you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA that year.9 While contributions to traditional IRAs aren’t limited by income, tax deductions on contributions can be reduced or disallowed if your income is above a certain amount, and you or your spouse are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Which Is Right for You?

If you’re looking for a long-term investment plan that will help you save for retirement, and you don’t have a 401(k) from your employer, an IRA is a good solution. It allows you to gradually save over the years while, generally speaking, earning more interest than you can get from CDs.10


Once you turn 59½, you can begin to take withdrawals without any penalties. You’ll get the most out of an IRA if you start investing early in life, qualify for the full tax deductions on your contributions, and make the maximum allowed contribution each year. However, the contribution limits cap the amount you can invest, so your IRA can only grow so much.3

CDs offer a shorter-term investment option with lower returns but fewer limitations. If you have funds you’d like to keep more liquid but still want to grow, you can turn to CDs with terms from one month to five years. CD laddering is a popular strategy in which investors buy a mix of short- and long-term CDs to improve liquidity while maximizing interest rates.

The Bottom Line

CDs and IRAs can both play important roles in your investment strategy. IRAs are great plans to put into place as part of your long-term retirement savings. Meanwhile, CDs can help you earn interest on a shorter-term basis.


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is an IRA or CD better?

It depends on where you're at in life. If you're looking for a long-term investment that you can use when you retire, IRAs are typically the better choice. If you want a short-term, risk-averse investment, then CDs are a good fit.

What is the difference between a CD and an IRA account?

CDs tend to have low APYs and terms that typically range from a few months to five years, although terms can be longer. IRAs are retirement accounts with more complex rules and tax benefits. Generally speaking, IRAs earn more over time than CDs.

benefits of high-yield savings accounts vs traditional savings accounts,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-an-interest-checking-account-315272,"PHOTO: FG TRADE / GETTY IMAGES
DEFINITION

An interest checking account is a type of checking account that earns interest on your account balance.

Key Takeaways
An interest checking account accrues interest on your account balance.
Standard interest checking accounts offer less interest but fewer requirements and a simpler interest structure, whereas rewards checking accounts offer more interest in exchange for more requirements and a more complex interest structure.
These accounts can be opened online or in person at banks or credit unions but may require a check of your ChexSystems report.
Definition and Example of an Interest Checking Account

An interest checking account is a checking account that accrues interest on the money in it. As long as the requirements to earn interest are manageable, the interest benefit of these accounts gives savers an opportunity to grow their deposits on autopilot. The interest is usually expressed as an annualized rate known as ""annual percentage yield"" (APY). It's calculated as a percentage of your balance and paid out periodically.

Alternate name: Interest-bearing checking account

For example, if you deposit $10,000 in an interest checking account with a 0.20% APY, after a year of savings you'll earn an extra $20.00.1

How an Interest Checking Account Works

Traditionally, checking accounts are not interest-bearing accounts as savings accounts are, as they’re designed for short-term cash that you’ll spend soon. Savings accounts are better-known for earning interest, but these accounts ordinarily limit how often you can make certain withdrawals from the account.

Interest checking accounts, available from banks and credit unions, incorporate key features from both of these account types. You can use them as standard checking accounts; they come with a debit card for purchases, checks for spending, automatic electronic payments, and online bill payments. All the while, you'll earn interest on your balance as with a savings account. This interest rate is applied to your balance and paid out according to the terms in your contract with the bank or financial institution.

The catch is that you'll sometimes need to pay a higher monthly fee and maintain a minimum account balance to earn that interest in comparison to what you'd pay for a standard checking account.2 However, some interest checking accounts, usually online-only accounts, impose none of these requirements.

For example, suppose that ABC Bank offers up to 0.60% APY on its interest checking account but not on all balances. It offers 0.60% APY on balances of $25,000 and above, 0.30% on balances between $10,000 and $24,999, and only 0.20% on balances below $10,000. In addition, you need to maintain an average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid a $15 monthly fee. You'll need to maintain a minimum average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid fees, but you'll need to keep another $10,000 in the account to earn the top rate.

Note

The interest you earn on these accounts is subject to taxation.

Types of Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts fall into one of two categories:

Standard interest checking accounts
Reward checking accounts
Standard Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts are available at both brick-and-mortar and online-only banks and credit unions and pay less interest but impose minimal requirements.

Requirements to earn interest: You'll typically earn interest simply by holding deposits that meet the institution's threshold for earning the stated APY.
Interest structure: Some pay the same interest rate on all balances, whereas others pay a higher rate as your balance increases, as in the earlier example of ABC Bank.
Fees: Potential fees include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and foreign ATM fees.

Capital One 360 Checking, Ally Interest Checking, and Citi Elevate High-Yield Checking are all examples of this type of interest checking account.

Rewards Checking Accounts

Sometimes called ""high-yield"" or ""high-interest checking accounts,"" these accounts usually pay a more competitive APY than standard interest checking accounts—sometimes even higher than long-term certificates of deposit (CDs)—as a reward for meeting more stringent requirements. In addition, they're harder to find—community banks and credit unions are your best bets.

Requirements to earn interest: Common requirements for earning the lucrative APY on these checking accounts include the need to use your debit card a certain number of times per month (and in some cases, for a certain purchase amount each time), receive one or more direct deposits or ACH payments each month, enroll in online banking, and receive electronic bank statements.3
Interest structure: These accounts often come with a tiered interest structure, meaning that you'll earn the top rate on balances of up to a certain amount and a lower rate beyond that balance. If you don't meet the requirements in a given month, you'll typically earn interest at a lower rate. For example, a bank might offer up to 4% APY on its rewards interest checking account but only offer the top rate on balances of up to $3,000, 2% on balances between $3,000 and $10,000, and only 0.10% on balances above $10,000.
Fees: The upside of these accounts is that they often impose no minimum balance requirement or monthly fee. However, they're still subject to other common fees, such as overdraft and foreign ATM fees.

The Consumers Credit Union Reward Checking Account and Elements Financial Credit Union High Interest Checking Account are examples of this type of account.

Note

To meet the required number of debit card transactions each month to earn the top interest rate, consider setting up recurring purchases such as gift cards or small donations to charities.

Interest Checking Accounts vs. Money Market Accounts

While not technically checking accounts, money market accounts are similar accounts that may serve as an alternative for consumers who seek an attractive APY without the tougher requirements of a rewards checking account.

INTEREST CHECKING ACCOUNT	MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT
More rules to earn interest on rewards accounts	Fewer requirements to earn interest
No withdrawal limits	Traditionally imposes withdrawal limits
Better for everyday spending	Better for emergency savings or occasional spending

In terms of account features, money market accounts are similar to standard interest checking accounts; you generally only need to keep qualifying deposits in the account to earn interest, which might be the same at all balance tiers or yield more interest as your balance increases. Monthly maintenance fees can apply.

These accounts fall under the category of savings accounts but typically pay more than traditional savings accounts. In addition, they often pay more interest than standard interest checking accounts but less than rewards checking accounts.

Money market accounts typically offer a debit card and check-writing privileges. However, check writing is more limited, as are external transfers, as money market accounts, like savings accounts, have traditionally only allowed consumers to make six withdrawals per month.4

Note

The withdrawal restriction was lifted in April 2020 but may still apply at some financial institutions. Inquire with yours for the latest rules.5

As such, money market accounts are a good fit for emergency funds but aren't designed for everyday spending. Interest checking accounts don't limit withdrawals in this way, making them more suitable for frequent check writing.

How to Get an Interest Checking Account

You can open an account online, or, if the financial institution has branches, in person. Simply search for the institution online to find and visit its website.

When you apply for an interest checking account, you'll be asked to provide some form of government identification, personal information such as your Social Security number, and an opening deposit (if required).

Many institutions will reference your ChexSystems report, which details your past deposit account activities, when deciding whether to approve or deny your application.6 If approved, you can register your account for online access and will receive your debit card in the mail.

current annual percentage yield for high-yield savings accounts,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/how-to-build-your-savings-while-earning-rewards-4843937,"Maximizing your savings comes down to finding the right savings vehicle. And it’s not all about interest rates. Even in a low-interest market, you can make the most of your savings while accommodating your lifestyle and budget. The key is to look for a savings account that matches your individual needs. So, what are the best options to choose from? Following a few simple steps can help you determine which type of savings vehicle is right for you.

Determine Your Savings Needs

Before you can settle on the best savings account, it’s important to have a clear sense of your overall financial goals. This means creating a budget and identifying how much of your income you can spend and how much you can save. The best way to do this is by tracking your current essential and nonessential expenses—including rent, utilities, groceries, and entertainment—and using that information to create a monthly savings goal. 

A good rule of thumb is to save around 5% to 8% of your current income, though you can adjust this based on your specific needs and circumstances. Once you’ve established your savings goal, you can look for a savings vehicle that will offer you the best return on investment while also allowing you to maintain your desired lifestyle.  

Understand the Different Savings Options

High-yield savings accounts have become a big trend over the past few years, but they’re not the only way to maximize savings. Savings vehicles such as CDs and money market accounts can also be good options for long-term savers, though it’s worth noting that they don’t offer the same level of liquidity as traditional savings accounts.

Given the current circumstances, it’s also important to select an account that offers you the flexibility to securely and confidently bank from home. Digital accounts can provide this type of flexibility, and when combined with other benefits, such as direct deposit of savings, they can provide the best overall customer experience.

For those looking for a digital account that can help maximize savings with rewards rather than earned interest, the Bask Savings Account earns one American Airlines AAdvantage® mile for every dollar saved annually—a great alternative to traditional savings solutions.

Opt for a Savings Vehicle That Fits Your Financial Needs and Lifestyle

The key to selecting the right type of savings account is to determine which option aligns most closely with your financial goals. Ask yourself what features are most important and what you’re looking to get out of your savings. If you need easy access to cash, a digital savings account is likely your best option. From there, it’s important to focus on other features that most closely match your needs. 

If you’re looking for a long-term savings solution and aren’t as concerned about interest rates or rewards, a CD or money market account could be a good option.

On the other hand, if you’re looking for a lifestyle-focused option that can offer you a more rewarding alternative to an interest-based account, the Bask Savings Account could be right for you. By earning AAdvantage® miles rather than interest, the Bask Savings Account can serve as a complement to other savings solutions while helping you go a lot further. 

In fact, based on the current industry average annual percentage yield of 0.10%*, if you have $5,000 in savings, you’re likely to earn only $5.00 in an average year with a traditional savings account, whereas you could earn 5,000 AAdvantage® miles with a Bask Savings Account, making it easier to travel once current circumstances allow for it. This can be a great way to earn that last batch of miles toward a dream vacation, a trip to see family, or even a honeymoon.

Whatever your future travel goals, choosing an account that helps you build savings while earning miles can help you outsmart interest, especially in the current climate. And because Bask Bank is FDIC insured, your savings will be protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category, even if circumstances change.

Selecting the right savings account doesn’t have to be complicated. By figuring out your individual needs and the features that most closely align with them, you can choose the right savings vehicle and start growing your savings. 

Note

Industry average annual percentage yield of 0.10% is based on the FDIC calculated national rate effective July 18, 2022.1

Disclosures

Bask Bank and BankDirect are divisions of Texas Capital Bank, N.A. Member FDIC. The sum of your total deposits with (i) Bask Bank; (ii) BankDirect; and (iii) Texas Capital Bank, N.A. are insured for up to $250,000. Additional coverage may be available depending on how your assets are held.

THE BALANCE/ALICE MORGAN

Dear Kristin,

I've finally reached a place in my life where my savings account feels really robust and my parents have mentioned that I should start exploring other options to make sure I'm maximizing my interest. I feel so overwhelmed and intimidated by this—what are my other options?

I don't feel prepared to jump into stocks or property investments, which I know are common routes for people my age. Are there easier ways or types of accounts I can leverage to ensure my money isn't just sitting collecting cobwebs but is actually building sizable interest?

Sincerely,

Unsavvy Saver

Dear Unsavvy, 

Congratulations on saving up a sizable amount of money! You don’t mention how much you’ve managed to save, but at minimum, you’ll want to set aside at least three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund (six or more is even better).1

After that, you can build up more interest on the rest of your savings by taking advantage of a high-yield savings account. It’s a savings account that has a higher interest rate than your typical savings account—known as the annual percentage yield (APY)—and is usually offered by online-only banks. While you may not want to move all your money to such an account (you may have use for the financial services offered by your current bank), it’s something to consider.

You could also place your money into a money market account, which is a combination of a savings and checking account that gives you a higher interest rate. Money market accounts are not as flexible as your average checking account, though. There are limits on the number of payments and withdrawals you can make per month by check, electronic transfer, draft, and debit card.2

A CD (certificate of deposit) is another low-risk way to earn interest. A CD is a type of savings account that pays you a fixed amount of interest at the end of a specified term, such as six months or one year. The catch here is that you won’t be able to touch your money (without a penalty) until the term is up and the CD has reached its maturity date.3

I hear you when you say you are overwhelmed and intimidated by investing, but you write that you want to earn a “sizable” amount of interest on your funds, and investing is truly the best way to do that. Investing doesn’t need to be difficult; there are less risky, easier types of investments you can explore as a beginner.

While I generally suggest new investors invest in ETFs (exchange-traded funds) or index funds, it seems that both are out of your comfort zone. It sounds like you’d be a “conservative” investor—you want low-risk investments that can still beat inflation. Lucky for you, there are a whole host of investments to choose from. Bond funds and balanced funds might be good choices. Just remember: “Low risk” doesn’t mean “no risk” and you may want to seek further advice from a financial advisor. 

I do want to stress that with that low risk, you are also looking at a low reward. If you want to build up a sizable amount of interest to help grow your funds, you’re going to want to expand into other investments. Start small, and build up your investments over time. 

Good luck!

This is where having goal-specific savings accounts can come in handy. These can include a high-yield savings account for higher rates of return, a money market account for long-term savings, and an awards-focused account to help you build up miles for future travel.

Bask Bank recently came out with this type of savings account, and it could significantly change the way you think of saving for travel. Here’s what you need to know about Bask Bank’s new savings account.

Travel Rewards That Could Outpace Interest

Offering a unique type of return, the Bask Savings Account awards savers with American Airlines AAdvantage® miles rather than interest. As a result, savers can earn one AAdvantage® mile for every dollar they save annually, and that can translate into big travel awards over the course of a year. 

As an added bonus, Bask Bank is currently offering another benefit through Aug. 31, 2022. If you deposit and maintain a minimum daily account balance of $5,000 for 90 consecutive days out of the first 120 days following the initial account opening, you’ll earn 1,000 bonus AAdvantage® miles. This is a great way to kick off your savings, and it can help you quickly earn miles for a future trip.

Since miles are deposited monthly, having a Bask Savings Account means your miles never expire. You’ll be able to plan a trip whenever global circumstances allow for it, without having to worry about what will happen to the miles you’ve earned. 

The Ability to Overcome a Low-Interest Environment 

Interest rates have dropped significantly over the last few years but have bounced higher somewhat thanks to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to combat inflation in 2022. Interest rates on traditional savings accounts are still historically low, with the standard rate at 0.10% APY. This has affected both traditional savings accounts and savings vehicles such as CDs, making an awards-based account a better option for many savers.12

Note

The industry average annual percentage yield of 0.10% is based on the FDIC calculated national rate effective July 2022.2

To put this into perspective, if you were to have $60,000 earning the industry average of 0.10% APY in a traditional savings account, you would earn $60 over the course of one year. By comparison, in a Bask Savings Account, that same $60,000 would earn 60,000 AAdvantage® miles over the same time period (before factoring in any bonus offers). That translates into a much higher rate of return, making it easy to save on travel and to plan trips you may not otherwise have considered. 

The Flexibility to Make Your Savings Fit Your Lifestyle

In addition to helping savers earn AAdvantage® miles, the Bask Savings Account offers a unique way to upgrade your travel. This can be a great option for those looking to supplement their travel budgets and make their travel dreams a reality once current global circumstances allow for it. By offering a new way to maximize savings, Bask Bank is a great option for those looking for a new way to save that fits their lifestyle. 

With different types of savings accounts becoming more popular, being able to have goal-specific accounts can help you meet multiple goals at once while making saving a more rewarding experience. If you’re looking to maximize your savings while planning your next adventure, a Bask Savings Account could be right for you.


Disclosures
All Bonus Award offers are valid through Aug. 31, 2022. Terms and Conditions apply.
AAdvantage® bonus miles are awarded within ten business days upon meeting offer qualifications and may take 6-8 weeks to post to your AAdvantage® account.
The value of this offer will be reported to the IRS, and the recipient is responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes on this offer.

DEFINITION

An interest checking account is a type of checking account that earns interest on your account balance.

Key Takeaways
An interest checking account accrues interest on your account balance.
Standard interest checking accounts offer less interest but fewer requirements and a simpler interest structure, whereas rewards checking accounts offer more interest in exchange for more requirements and a more complex interest structure.
These accounts can be opened online or in person at banks or credit unions but may require a check of your ChexSystems report.
Definition and Example of an Interest Checking Account

An interest checking account is a checking account that accrues interest on the money in it. As long as the requirements to earn interest are manageable, the interest benefit of these accounts gives savers an opportunity to grow their deposits on autopilot. The interest is usually expressed as an annualized rate known as ""annual percentage yield"" (APY). It's calculated as a percentage of your balance and paid out periodically.

Alternate name: Interest-bearing checking account

For example, if you deposit $10,000 in an interest checking account with a 0.20% APY, after a year of savings you'll earn an extra $20.00.1

How an Interest Checking Account Works

Traditionally, checking accounts are not interest-bearing accounts as savings accounts are, as they’re designed for short-term cash that you’ll spend soon. Savings accounts are better-known for earning interest, but these accounts ordinarily limit how often you can make certain withdrawals from the account.

Interest checking accounts, available from banks and credit unions, incorporate key features from both of these account types. You can use them as standard checking accounts; they come with a debit card for purchases, checks for spending, automatic electronic payments, and online bill payments. All the while, you'll earn interest on your balance as with a savings account. This interest rate is applied to your balance and paid out according to the terms in your contract with the bank or financial institution.

The catch is that you'll sometimes need to pay a higher monthly fee and maintain a minimum account balance to earn that interest in comparison to what you'd pay for a standard checking account.2 However, some interest checking accounts, usually online-only accounts, impose none of these requirements.

For example, suppose that ABC Bank offers up to 0.60% APY on its interest checking account but not on all balances. It offers 0.60% APY on balances of $25,000 and above, 0.30% on balances between $10,000 and $24,999, and only 0.20% on balances below $10,000. In addition, you need to maintain an average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid a $15 monthly fee. You'll need to maintain a minimum average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid fees, but you'll need to keep another $10,000 in the account to earn the top rate.

Note

The interest you earn on these accounts is subject to taxation.

Types of Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts fall into one of two categories:

Standard interest checking accounts
Reward checking accounts
Standard Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts are available at both brick-and-mortar and online-only banks and credit unions and pay less interest but impose minimal requirements.

Requirements to earn interest: You'll typically earn interest simply by holding deposits that meet the institution's threshold for earning the stated APY.
Interest structure: Some pay the same interest rate on all balances, whereas others pay a higher rate as your balance increases, as in the earlier example of ABC Bank.
Fees: Potential fees include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and foreign ATM fees.

Capital One 360 Checking, Ally Interest Checking, and Citi Elevate High-Yield Checking are all examples of this type of interest checking account.

Rewards Checking Accounts

Sometimes called ""high-yield"" or ""high-interest checking accounts,"" these accounts usually pay a more competitive APY than standard interest checking accounts—sometimes even higher than long-term certificates of deposit (CDs)—as a reward for meeting more stringent requirements. In addition, they're harder to find—community banks and credit unions are your best bets.

Requirements to earn interest: Common requirements for earning the lucrative APY on these checking accounts include the need to use your debit card a certain number of times per month (and in some cases, for a certain purchase amount each time), receive one or more direct deposits or ACH payments each month, enroll in online banking, and receive electronic bank statements.3
Interest structure: These accounts often come with a tiered interest structure, meaning that you'll earn the top rate on balances of up to a certain amount and a lower rate beyond that balance. If you don't meet the requirements in a given month, you'll typically earn interest at a lower rate. For example, a bank might offer up to 4% APY on its rewards interest checking account but only offer the top rate on balances of up to $3,000, 2% on balances between $3,000 and $10,000, and only 0.10% on balances above $10,000.
Fees: The upside of these accounts is that they often impose no minimum balance requirement or monthly fee. However, they're still subject to other common fees, such as overdraft and foreign ATM fees.

The Consumers Credit Union Reward Checking Account and Elements Financial Credit Union High Interest Checking Account are examples of this type of account.

Note

To meet the required number of debit card transactions each month to earn the top interest rate, consider setting up recurring purchases such as gift cards or small donations to charities.

Interest Checking Accounts vs. Money Market Accounts

While not technically checking accounts, money market accounts are similar accounts that may serve as an alternative for consumers who seek an attractive APY without the tougher requirements of a rewards checking account.

INTEREST CHECKING ACCOUNT	MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT
More rules to earn interest on rewards accounts	Fewer requirements to earn interest
No withdrawal limits	Traditionally imposes withdrawal limits
Better for everyday spending	Better for emergency savings or occasional spending

In terms of account features, money market accounts are similar to standard interest checking accounts; you generally only need to keep qualifying deposits in the account to earn interest, which might be the same at all balance tiers or yield more interest as your balance increases. Monthly maintenance fees can apply.

These accounts fall under the category of savings accounts but typically pay more than traditional savings accounts. In addition, they often pay more interest than standard interest checking accounts but less than rewards checking accounts.

Money market accounts typically offer a debit card and check-writing privileges. However, check writing is more limited, as are external transfers, as money market accounts, like savings accounts, have traditionally only allowed consumers to make six withdrawals per month.4

Note

The withdrawal restriction was lifted in April 2020 but may still apply at some financial institutions. Inquire with yours for the latest rules.5

As such, money market accounts are a good fit for emergency funds but aren't designed for everyday spending. Interest checking accounts don't limit withdrawals in this way, making them more suitable for frequent check writing.

How to Get an Interest Checking Account

You can open an account online, or, if the financial institution has branches, in person. Simply search for the institution online to find and visit its website.

When you apply for an interest checking account, you'll be asked to provide some form of government identification, personal information such as your Social Security number, and an opening deposit (if required).

Many institutions will reference your ChexSystems report, which details your past deposit account activities, when deciding whether to approve or deny your application.6 If approved, you can register your account for online access and will receive your debit card in the mail.

THE BALANCE / MADDY PRICE

To open a bank account, you'll need to first choose a bank and provide it with some necessary information, including your identification and proof of address. You'll usually need to be 18 to meet the bank's eligibility requirements. Finally, you might need to fund the account or have a minimum balance to avoid fees.

Here's what you need to know about opening a new bank account, including tips on choosing a bank and the type of account.

Key Takeaways
To open an account, you'll need to bring a government-issued ID, your identification number, and your physical and mailing address.
When deciding on an account, you'll want to read the disclosures so you can learn about any account fees or balance minimums.
You can decide what bank or account you want based on the features you're looking for, whether it's high interest rates, low balance minimums, no ATM fees, or something else.
What You Need to Open a Bank Account

When you open a new bank account, you'll need to give the bank or credit union documentation so they can verify your identity.

Have the following items ready:

A government-issued ID (such as a driver’s license, passport, or military ID)
Your identification number
Proof of your physical and mailing address
An initial deposit (if required)

If you don’t have a government-issued ID, you may be able to use another form of ID. Ask your bank what other forms of identification it can accept.

Depending on your situation, your identification number may be your Social Security number, alien identification card number, Individual Tax Payer Identification Number, or another government-issued ID number. If you're a United States citizen, your identification number is most likely your Social Security number.

You'll need to provide this information in some form whether you're opening up an account online or in person.1

Choose a Bank or Credit Union

After you have all of your documents together, you'll want to choose the best bank or credit union for your situation. If you know what type of account you want, you can look for the best deals, whether you're in the market for an online checking account, a high-yield savings account, or something else.

There are three basic categories of financial institutions:

Banks, including community banks and big banks: These might be well-known brands in your local community, or nationwide. They should offer most of the basic services you need, including checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and more.2
Credit unions: A credit union is a customer-owned financial institution that provides many of the same services and products that banks provide. If you opt to join one of these not-for-profit institutions, you'll often enjoy competitive rates because they're not necessarily trying to maximize profits. But that’s not always the case—so review fee schedules carefully.
Online banks and credit unions: These institutions operate entirely online. There’s no branch to visit (or pay for), and you’ll handle most service requests yourself. If you have access to and are comfortable using a computer or mobile device—and performing basic banking transactions—an online bank can help you reduce your fees and earn higher interest rates on savings accounts.3
Note

You might want to have accounts with multiple banks. For example, you may decide to open an online bank account and a brick-and-mortar bank to keep your fees low and maintain the ability to visit an in-person bank if you need to.

Choosing an Account

If you're not sure what type of account you want, consider what your needs are.

Checking accounts: These accounts are typically used to make payments and receive direct deposits.
Savings accounts: These accounts allow you to put your savings aside and earn interest on the money you're not currently using.
Money market accounts: These products sometimes earn slightly more interest than savings accounts (while maintaining your access to cash). You may also have debit and check writing options with these accounts.4
Certificates of deposit (CDs): These products can earn much more than savings accounts but require you to lock up your funds for a certain period.5

Within one of the above categories, a bank may offer multiple products, each with a different name and level of service. These accounts may have different minimum balance thresholds, fees, or interest rates.

A general rule of thumb is to choose an option with a mix of features and fees that meet your needs and budget. For example, if you think you won’t keep a lot of money in the account, you may want to open a bank account with a low initial deposit and low or no minimum balance and fee requirements so you don’t get stuck paying unnecessary fees.

Note

In general, you'll only want to bank where your money is protected by FDIC insurance (or NCUSIF coverage if you use a credit union).

Your Financial History

Your financial history doesn’t need to be impeccable to open a bank account, but it may play into the bank’s decision to approve or deny your application. Your bank or credit union might use ChexSystems, a targeted consumer reporting agency that tracks checking and savings accounts, to determine how much risk a potential customer might pose to the institution where they’re applying for an account. ChexSystems is the banking equivalent of the credit reporting bureaus. 

You don’t necessarily need good credit to get a bank account, but if you're having trouble opening an account, you might want to review your credit report and get a copy of your ChexSystems report.

Opening an Account

Once you've decided on a bank and type of account, you'll need to provide the bank with your information and sign some paperwork.

You’ll have to agree to abide by certain rules and accept responsibility for certain activities in your accounts. Make sure you read the disclosures before opening an account with the bank. Pay special attention to any fees, and make sure you know how often you can make withdrawals and deposits.

Note

If you’re under 18 years old, you’ll need someone over age 18 to open the account with you. You still might be able to use a debit card and online banking, and you can eventually get your own account.

Print, Sign, and Mail (If Required)

If you're opening a bank account online, you may have to print, sign, and mail a document to the bank before the account is opened. Some banks use electronic disclosure and consent to make the banking relationship legally binding—you can do everything online.6

Others still require a signed document to open an account.7 Until the bank receives the documents, your account is not active.

Fund Your Account

If you’re opening a checking or savings account, you’ll often need to make an initial deposit into the account. Sometimes, this is required as part of the opening process, and other times, you can do it after the account is up and running. There are several ways to fund your account:

Deposit cash: It should be available for you to spend within one business day.8
Deposit a check or money order: The funds should be available within a few business days after you make the deposit, but it may take longer because it's a new account.9
Set up direct deposit with your employer: If your company offers this, instead of getting a physical paycheck, your earnings will be sent directly to your new account.
Transfer funds electronically: You can move money from another bank account to make your initial deposit.
Start Using the Account

If you followed all the steps, you should have a brand new bank account in your name. It should be ready to use within a few minutes to a few days. For checking and savings accounts, keep an eye out for a debit card or ATM card in the mail.

You might also get a checkbook or be able to order one. To make the most of your account, you may be able to sign up for account features that help you manage your money, including:


Online bill pay: This feature allows you to pay bills electronically.
Remote check deposit: Your bank’s mobile app may allow you to deposit checks remotely so that you don’t have to make trips to a branch or fill out deposit slips.
Alerts: Sign up for text or email alerts so you know when your account balance is running low or when large withdrawals happen.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What do I need to open a bank account?

When you open a new bank account, you'll need to provide identification so that the bank can verify your identity. You'll want to bring a government-issued ID, like a driver's license, passport, or military ID. If you don't have a government-issued ID, you should ask your bank what other forms of identification it can accept. You'll need to provide your identification number, which might be a Social Security number, alien identification number, or other government-issued ID number. Finally, you'll need proof of your physical and mailing address, as well as an initial deposit, if required.

How much money do you need to open a bank account?

Every bank has its own requirements for opening account balances. Most banks will require an initial deposit that ranges from $25 to $100. However, you can also find a few banks that will allow you to open an account without any money down. Be sure to ask the bank how much money you need to deposit to open an account and what the minimum balance is to avoid fees. Make sure any bank you put your money in is FDIC-insured.101

How long does it take to open a bank account?

The application process for a new bank account is fairly quick. You can usually apply online in 15 minutes or less, though it may take a bit longer in person. It may also take a few days for the bank to verify your information and allow you to begin using your account.

AZMANL / GETTY IMAGES

To get control of your finances in seven days or less, you can start with a simple financial self-care checklist. There are seven things you can do during a week—one per day—to get your money back on track. Here's how your week could look:

Day 1: Take inventory of your finances
Day 2: Get back on budget
Day 3: Pay down debt
Day 4: Build an emergency fund
Day 5: Save for retirement
Day 6: Check your credit score
Day 7: Make your goals a reality

This checklist can help you focus on your financial self-care and manage your well-being. Financial well-being spans four key areas: security to pay your recurring bills, a plan for unexpected costs, freedom of choice with how you spend, and pursuing your long-term financial goals. This checklist covers all four areas. And your success in achieving financial well-being can be influenced by a variety of factors, including your attitude toward money, decision-making, and behavior.

Key Takeaways
You can practice financial self-care by spending a week reviewing your finances and getting your money in order.
Take inventory, get back on budget, pay down debt, save for emergencies, and more.
Managing your financial well-being is important and can help you achieve your goals in life.
Day 1: Take Inventory of Your Finances

The first item on your financial checklist is one you can't skip if you're committed to promoting better financial health. Once you know where you're starting from financially, you can work on fine-tuning your plan for long-term wellness where your money is concerned.

Taking stock of your monetary situation begins with asking the right questions and reviewing the right things. Your budget is a great place to start.

For example, here are some of the most important questions to ask as you take inventory of where your money is coming from and going: 

How much money are you bringing in each month?
Is that income consistent month to month?
How often do you get paid and how are you allocating money toward your bills?
What are your recurring monthly bills? 
Are you overspending in any category?
How much of your budget is going to debt repayment?
Are you including saving as a line item in your budget?

Getting familiar with what you earn versus what you spend is the foundation for any financial self-care plan. But it's also important to look at your bigger financial picture.

For example, if you have debt, you should know who you owe money to, the amount you owe, what you're paying in interest, and what percentage of your income goes toward debt each month. This information can come in handy once you get to Day 3 of your financial checklist (more on that below).

Note

If you have irregular income because you run a business or work as a freelancer, calculate your average income for the previous 12 months. Use that amount as your baseline to compare against your monthly spending.

Day 2: Get Back on Budget

Budgets aren't necessarily set in stone. While your income may stay relatively consistent month to month, you may find yourself spending more or less at different points in time. Charting your spending on a budget spreadsheet can make it easier to spot the patterns in your spending. 

Once you've created your budget spreadsheet, analyze it to determine what you may be wasting money on each month and where you can afford to cut back. For instance, some more-obvious things to reduce or eliminate may include:

Streaming or subscription services you don't use
Recurring memberships you don't actually need (for example, the gym)
Entertainment and recreation
Anything that's not a need, such as electronics, clothing, dinners out, etc.

Beyond those expenses, you should also look for other opportunities to practice financial self-care by trimming your budget. For instance, you may be able to lower your car insurance costs by shopping around for a new provider or save on homeowners insurance by bundling coverage.

Day 3: Pay Down Debt

Debt can be a roadblock on the path to financial wellness. Household debt reached $16.51 trillion in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.1 Whether it's credit card debt, a mortgage, or a loan, there are ways to pay them down.

If you have debts that you're paying via automatic payments, first review your bank account activity to ensure you have the money to cover those bills. This can help with avoiding costly overdraft fees or late payment penalties if a credit card or loan payment is returned.

Next, consider how to approach your debt payment plans if you have extra money left over in your budget after essential and non-essential expenses are covered. If you're carrying high-interest debt, that money could be applied toward those balances to pay them off faster. The sooner you can clear high-interest debt, the more money you can save on interest charges. There are a few strategies you can try, like the debt snowball strategy or the debt avalanche method.

Keep in mind, however, that you may want to allocate extra funds to savings if you don't have anything set aside for emergencies. According to a 2018 study from the Federal Reserve, approximately 40% of households aren't able to cover a $400 emergency with savings.2 If you don't have any money set aside, building up your savings can keep you from having to add to your debt by using credit cards to cover unexpected expenses.

Tip

Consider consolidating your debt or even refinancing your student loans to secure a lower interest rate. You may also be able to transfer high-interest credit card balances to a card with an introductory 0% annual percentage rate (APR).

Day 4: Build an Emergency Fund

Emergency funds can help bail you out financially if you run up against an unplanned expense or a financial situation you weren't expecting. They take time to build, so starting as soon as you can with any amount will help.

For example, if you get laid off from work or get sick and can't work, an emergency fund can help cover bills until things get back to normal. You can also draw on emergency savings to pay for things like vet bills, car repairs, or another critical expense you didn't see coming.

The amount you should have saved is up to you, although financial experts often recommend having three to six months' worth of expenses saved.3 Another rule of thumb you might use is to save a set dollar amount for each member of your household. So if you're a family of four, you might aim to save $2,500 per person for a total of $10,000 in emergency savings.

An effective way to save for emergencies is to add it to your budget as a recurring expense. By treating savings like a bill that has to be paid, you can ensure your emergency stash grows consistently.

Important

Emergency funds are meant to be liquid savings, meaning you can tap into them when you need them. For that reason, you may want to use a high-yield savings account or money market account to hold your money, in place of a certificate of deposit (CD) or investment account that has stricter rules for withdrawals.

Day 5: Save for Retirement

While you may not track your retirement savings every week, it's still important to have this item on your financial self-care checklist. Knowing how much you're saving (or not saving) toward retirement can help you determine how likely you are to reach your goal.

Investing through a 401(k) or 403(b) is often the easiest place to start with retirement planning. Many employers make it easy to save by making enrollment automatic when you're hired. If you're not sure whether you're enrolled in a retirement plan at work, get in touch with your human resources department. They can tell if you're signed up, what you're investing in, and how much you're contributing each payday.

If you don't have a retirement plan at work, an individual retirement account (IRA) is another way to save for the future. IRAs offer a tax-advantaged way to save for the future, and you can open one at virtually any online brokerage.

As you check in with your retirement savings plan weekly, monthly, or quarterly, pay attention to the things like:

How much you're contributing each month and year
What you're investing your money in
How well your investments are performing
What you're paying in fees to invest

That last part is important because fees can eat away at your returns over time. Investments like low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can help keep fees at bay.

Tip

Use an online retirement planning calculator to estimate how much you'll need to save monthly or yearly in order to set yourself up for your future.

Day 6: Check Your Credit Score and Report

Checking your credit score yourself doesn't impact your credit report or score, so it's fine to add this to your weekly financial wellness routine. As you look at your credit score, take note of how it's gone up or down over time. Then refer to your credit report—you can get a free report every year (if not more frequently) from AnnualCreditReport.com— and pay attention to what's on there to see how it may have impacted your score.

For example, things such as paying bills on time, keeping credit card balances low, keeping old accounts open, and only applying for new credit sparingly can have positive impacts on your credit. Paying late, running up large balances in relation to your credit limits, and opening multiple credit accounts in a short period of time can hurt your score.

Also, review your credit card statements each month to check your total spending and what you may pay in interest charges if you're carrying a balance. This is also a good opportunity to review your statements for suspicious transactions that could indicate fraud.

Note

If you find a credit report error, you can dispute it with the credit bureau that's reporting the information. By law, information that's proven to be inaccurate must be corrected or removed from your credit report.

Day 7: Make Your Financial Goals a Reality

Setting financial goals is another important aspect of self-care when it comes to your money. A lot of what's included on your financial checklist affects your money situation right now, but you should also keep the future in sight.

Ask yourself what your financial goals are. They may be something simple, like taking a solo vacation or buying a new car, or something bigger, like buying a home. As you brainstorm goals, create a roadmap for achieving them.

For example, say your goal is to pay off your $20,000 in student loans in the next two years. Your current monthly payment is $500 and your interest rate is 7%.

In this case, your financial checklist may look something like this:

Refinance private student loans to lower your interest rate
Increase your monthly payment to $875
Review your budget to find the extra $375 to apply to your loans
Consider starting a side hustle to bring in the additional money you need if you can't find it in your budget
Apply any financial windfalls, such as a tax refund or stimulus check, to your principal balance

You could use the same approach to save $20,000 instead if that's your goal. Only the steps might be something like:

Open a high-yield savings account to earn the best annual percentage yield (APY)
Review your budget to find $875 to save each month
Start a side hustle or use cashback apps to increase the amount of money you can save
Grow your savings faster by depositing tax refunds or other windfalls into your account

The key is making your goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. And besides that, make sure you're keeping track of your progress weekly, monthly, and annually to see where you may need to adjust your plans.

DEFINITION
Credit unions are financial institutions owned by their members and operated as nonprofits.

Credit unions are financial institutions owned by their members and operated as nonprofits. Initially created to serve and support people who share a common bond (such as place of employment or residence), many credit unions offer many ways to join and enjoy membership benefits. 

Let’s explore what credit unions are, the services they provide, and how credit unions work, as well as the types of credit unions, membership requirements, and how they compare to other financial institutions such as community banks. 

Definition and Example of Credit Unions

A credit union is a not-for-profit financial institution co-owned by its members. A credit union's members elect a volunteer board of directors to help manage the credit union. Profits are “returned” to credit union members in advantageous financial products and terms, while shareholders benefit from bank profits.1 Some credit unions return profits as annual dividends.

A member banking with a credit union might benefit from lower-than-average interest rates on loans or credit cards or higher-than-average interest rates on any money they save with the credit union.1

Many credit unions were originally established by and for a specific group of individuals. For example, the Navy Federal Credit Union was originally for Navy service members. Today, the credit union welcomes all current and retired armed forces (including the National Guard and Space Force), their household and family members, Department of Defense civilian employees, contractors, and reservists, among others.2

The National Credit Union Association (NCUA), created in 1970, regulates credit unions. The U.S. government backs federally insured credit union member accounts of up to $250,000 per account, similar to how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) backs bank deposits of up to $250,000.3

How Credit Unions Work 

Any profits the credit union receives as a result of lending, borrowing, or acting as a depository are returned to the members, typically in the form of lower interest rates on credit cards, home loans, personal loans, and car loans. This is paired with higher interest rates on CDs, money market accounts, and potentially, other savings accounts.

Note

Credit unions aren’t immune to financial winds. Credit unions often offered slightly higher interest rates for regular savings accounts in the past. As of late 2021, however, credit union national average rates for savings accounts are on par with banks’ national average rates due to the low-interest-rate environment overall.4

To become a member of a credit union, an individual opens a “share account” (like a savings account) with a small dollar amount. This represents your “share” or investment in the cooperative financial institution and is refundable if you close your account.5

Typically, you can open a credit union account and conduct your banking as you would at any other financial institution. These accounts may have different names: 

Bank	Credit Union
Customer or account holder	Member
Savings account	Share account
Checking and savings account	Share draft account
Certificate of deposit	Share term certificate or share certificate
Accessing Accounts

Many credit unions offer limited brick-and-mortar locations for banking services, and limited ATMs for withdrawing money, often located in specific geographic areas. One of the largest credit unions, Navy Federal Credit Union, offers 350 branches.6 One of the largest U.S. banks, JP Morgan & Chase, offers 4,700 branches.7

To offer members access, just under 1900 credit unions are part of the CO-OP Shared Branch network. If a credit union member needs to deposit a check while traveling, they can visit a partner credit union’s location or use its ATMs without paying a fee. The CO-OP Shared ATM network offers more than 30,000 surcharge-free ATMs throughout the U.S. and 10 nations.8

There may be some limitations, though—for example, you might be limited to $500 per day in withdrawals at the shared branch, funds may not be immediately available, or there may be fees associated with various services.9

Note

Some credit unions may refund or rebate fees incurred from using out-of-network ATMs for cash withdrawals for certain account types. 

Credit Union Services

Credit unions offer many of the same services as those found in banks, including: 

Accounts for savings, checking, and certificates of deposit
High-yield savings accounts
Online, ATM, and mobile banking
Mobile, online, and person-to-person payments 
Credit cards
Investment services including IRAs, other retirement accounts, and living trusts
Consumer loans for cars, boats, RVs
Student loans
Small business loans
Mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC)
Wire transfers, cashier’s checks, and ACH deposits
Safety deposit boxes
Personal insurance services

Services and products vary by credit union, and many come with provisions; a high-yield account, for example, could require a certain credit card spend or balance. You’ll need to carefully review the options to ensure the credit union offers what you hope to find. 

Credit unions may present limited choices, as well. For example, a credit union might offer only a handful of consumer credit cards versus the dozens offered by a bigger bank. The new-cardholder bonus or cash-back rate may be lower than bonuses at larger banks—but the interest rate may be lower as well. 

Note

You may not be able to perform some international services with a credit union account. For example, the credit union may not support wired transactions in a foreign currency, while banks may be better able to. Some banks may also provide cash in foreign currency or exchange foreign cash you return with from your travels—both more uncommon at a credit union. 

Who Can Join a Credit Union?

While anyone can join a bank, a credit union may require you to be part of a particular constituency to become a member and open an account. Typically, you need to have something in common with the other members. 

Gerenally, you can join based on one or more of the following categories: 

Employment: If you work for a specific employer or you’re employed within a particular profession or trade
Family: If you’re related to an existing credit union member 
Location: If you work, attend school, or live in a certain geographic area  
Membership: If you’re a member of a school, union, organization, or other group 

Many credit unions offer more than one path to membership, but you’ll often have to look beyond the name—which usually indicates for whom the credit union was originally intended, but has since expanded the field of membership. As an example, eight Delta Airlines employees founded the Delta Employees Credit Union in Georgia in 1940.10 Today, to join the Delta Community Credit Union, potential members can qualify by their geographic location, employment by dozens of local and national businesses, family relation to a current Delta Community CU member, or as part of membership in a variety of associations.11

Note

You may be able to join a credit union by first joining an organization. For example, becoming a member of Foster Care to Success makes you eligible for Alliant Credit Union membership, even if you don’t qualify in any other manner.12

How Much Do Credit Unions Cost?

Initial membership or sign-on fees for most credit unions are minimal. The credit union may ask you to make a refundable contribution of a few dollars toward your share account to get your membership started. Other credit unions may require initial deposits of $25 or more, or a small donation to an organization. To join the Lake Michigan Credit Union, for instance, a $5 donation to the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Foundation is required if you don’t meet any of their geographic or employment requirements.13

Fees at credit unions are often much lower than other banking institutions. For example, many credit unions offer free basic checking accounts that don’t require a minimum balance and don’t charge monthly maintenance fees.

However, fees can be and are often still charged for other products or services, including stop payments, nonsufficient funds, card replacement, or wire transfers. Some credit unions charge monthly fees for certain checking accounts, although they may come with additional services. 

Note

Credit unions may charge inactivity, dormant, or “non-participation fees” if you don’t appear to be using your accounts, usually after some time, such as 12 or 24 months. 

Types of Credit Unions

There are a few credit union types that serve special populations: 

Low-Income Credit Unions: Serves a population in which more than 50% of its members qualify as “low-income,” earning 80% or less than the median family income or individual income for designated locations. The population’s unique needs may include access to small-dollar loans and business loans, money orders, check cashing, and financial education. 14
Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs): To qualify as an MDI, more than 50% of current members, current and eligible members (from the community), or current board members must be from these federally recognized minority groups: Black American, Asian American, Hispanic American, or Native American. 15
In-School Credit Union Branches: Also known as student-run credit unions, these credit union branches allow students to open savings accounts and deposit money into their accounts. Branch services vary by the school and credit union and often rely on student or parent volunteers trained to carry out tasks. 
Credit Unions vs. Banks

Here’s a quick look at credit unions versus traditional banks. 

 	Credit Unions	Large Banks
Tax Status	Not-for-profit	For-profit
Use	Members united by a common bond	Anyone
Physical Branches	Possibly limited unless credit union is in CO-OP network	Range between 1 to thousands
ATMs	Local only unless in an ATMs network	Often nationally available
Account name	Share account	Savings account
Services and products	Vary by credit union	Usually consistent, although some products or rates may vary by consumer or bank location
Savings, money market, CD interest rates	Generally higher	Generally lower
Loan and credit card interest rates	Generally lower	Generally higher
Fees	Generally fewer	Generally more
Fund Insurance	Up to $250,000 by NCUA (National Credit Union Administration)	Up to $250,000 by FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp)
Profits	Returned to members through dividends, advantageous rates or fewer/lower fees	Distributed to shareholders
Foreign cash access and wires	May not be as readily available	Readily available, particularly at larger or international banks
Alternatives to Credit Unions: Community Banks or Online Banks

If you don’t qualify for credit union membership or there isn’t one in your town, a community bank is a possible alternative. A community bank is usually privately and locally owned. According to the U.S.Federal Reserve, community banks typically hold less than $10 billion in assets.16

Community banks often also offer:17 

Lower fees 
Better interest rates for loans, credit cards, and savings accounts
Local control and decision making 
Lending for local small businesses
Community relationships, involvement, and specialization 

Online banks or online-only accounts can be another alternative not charging checking account maintenance fees, although they may have minimum balance requirements to earn higher interest rates, and may not have physical branches.

Key Takeaways
Credit unions return profits to members through better interest rates, lower fees, and dividends.
Credit unions are regulated by the NCUA, which guarantees deposits of up to $250,000.
Services and products at credit unions vary widely.
Compare the service options and products you’re likely to use at a credit union on an apples-to-apples basis to banks, online banks, and community banks.
