Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Best Way to Set a Budget?

Different methods might be best for different people.

Sticking to a budget, paying down debt, and knowing exactly where every dollar is going can help make it possible to increase your savings. Having the details to find that extra $10 or $20 per week or month that you can save or invest today can add up to thousands of dollars years from now.

What Are the Key Elements of Financial Planning?

Budgeting is a big part of financial planning. To be successful, it is important to account for everything necessary to financial health. In addition to simply knowing your income and expenses, you have to think about where you will be in the future with income and expenses.

Budgeting and saving money don't come naturally to many people for obvious reasons. Spending money on nonessentials is so easy, even if you're committed to a well-laid spending plan.

Still, getting on track with a realistic budget and squirreling money away may not be as difficult as you think. Begin by taking the time to create a budget, which can help you reorganize your finances, prioritize spending, and manage debt, thus allowing you to make progress toward your long-term financial goals.

Make a Classic Budget

Budgeting your money is the cornerstone of a sound financial plan, and seeing all of the numbers in black and white can offer valuable perspective on where your money is going and where you could put it to better use.

A budget can help you spot areas where you're spending more than you realize. It can also be set up to allow for the occasional indulgence as well as unforeseen emergencies. You have lots of reasons to set aside a few hours to build a classic budget, especially when you can do it in four practically painless steps.

Gather into one place all of your electronic or paper bills, receipts, pay stubs, bank statements and any other record of income or expenses for at least a month. Or keep track of monthly income and expenditures as they happen.
Create a budget worksheet, using a budget template from Google Sheets, an Excel spreadsheet, or paper and pen. List all of your income after taxes—for example, employee and freelance income, investment income, and interest earned on any savings accounts. Then list all expenses—for example, rent or mortgage payments, credit card payments, installment loan payments, grocery receipts and utility bills.
Add up each set of figures, and subtract the expense total from the income total to get a general picture of your financial health. If your income total is larger than your expense total—congratulations—you just found more money for saving, investing and paying down your debt. If your expense total is larger than your income total, all is not lost, but you'll have to make some choices about where you spend some of your money going forward if you want to balance your budget.
Drill down into your expenses and further categorize them into fixed, variable and discretionary expenses. Fixed expenses (such as your rent) remain the same from month to month and thus often constitute the basis of your budget. Variable expenses, such as utility bills, can typically be lowered with behavioral tweaks like turning off the lights as you leave a room, and discretionary expenses consist of wants rather than needs and provide the most opportunities for saving.
Adopt the 50-20-30 Approach

You have alternatives if you don't want to make a classic budget. For example, you could consider structuring your plan according to the 50-20-30 rule. Under this approach to budgeting, you spend:

50% of your after-tax income on housing, food, and other necessities
20% on paying down debt or increasing savings
30% on whatever you want—discretionary spending

Although this plan is simple, some critics say that it allows too much discretionary spending and doesn't emphasize debt reduction or savings enough.

Use Apps

Another alternative to a classic budget is a budget app that can be downloaded to your phone, tablet, or computer. You generally link your app of choice to your checking and credit card accounts, and the app tracks your spending and generates a monthly report by spending category.

Budget apps can often be set up to alert you when a payment is coming due, when an account balance is getting too low, or if there's suspicious activity in your account. The cost of most apps ranges from zero to several dollars a month, although some offer free introductory periods so that you can try before you buy.

Put Your Budget to Work

Once you figure out how much money you're spending and where you're in a better position, take the necessary steps to put your financial future front and center.

Reduce Spending

Start by cutting spending on items you don't need. For example, do you need a $5 coffee every morning? Could you make do with a smaller, older car? Instead of an expensive vacation, would you be willing to try a stay-at-home vacation (""staycation"")?

These types of choices are very personal, so there's no right or wrong answer. But laying them out on the table can at least help you understand your priorities and some of the options you might not have realized you had for saving money.

Get a Handle on Your Debt

One aspect that seems to come with adulthood is accumulating some form of debt. Credit cards, student loans, car loans and mortgage payments are common types of debt. Credit cards and other forms of debt can be an essential part of your financial toolbox because they build your credit history, but you should exercise care when using them. Understanding the difference between good debt and bad debt can go a long way toward making sure you use credit wisely and maintain a good credit history.

At the same time, you should always look for ways to make your debt less expensive while you're paying it off. Transferring your credit card balances to a card with a 0% APR or refinancing your student loans, for example, could reduce the amount you pay in interest charges and accelerate your debt payoff plans.

To build wealth, you have to start somewhere. The ability to save money is essential, but the first step in saving is spending less than you earn. This point may seem obvious, but it's often more easily said than done. Fortunately, even if your budget doesn't allow much wiggle room, dozens of ways to save money are available.

Reduce Your Tax Burden

Nobody likes paying taxes, but they're an important aspect of any financial plan. Even if you don't make much money, you might be surprised to learn how certain tax strategies and decisions can affect your finances.

Learning how to minimize the impact of taxes on your finances can ensure that more money is going into your pocket and moving you toward your financial goals. Tax planning includes claiming all of the deductions and tax credits you're eligible for, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as an employer's 401(k) plan, an IRA, or a Health Savings Account (HSA), as often as possible.

Set Up Automatic Savings

One of the best and most convenient paths toward wealth accumulation is to sign up for automatic savings. Open a savings account, and then link your checking account to it so that an affordable, fixed amount is automatically transferred into your savings account every month.

Shop Smart and Live Frugally

Plan weekly menus and meal-prepping around inexpensive, nutritious foods, and draw your shopping list directly from these menus. Try to avoid running to the store multiple times a week by designating one day a week as your shopping day. When that day rolls around, take your list to a local discount market, and stick to the list.

Clip paper coupons to redeem at grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants, and more, or try using one of the many available coupon apps to take page flipping and scissors out of the equation.

Shop for clothes, furniture, and toys at garage sales, thrift stores, and vintage shops, but spring for new mattresses, upholstered furniture, swimsuits, underwear, bike helmets, shoes, and the like. Never buy these latter types of items used.

Attempt to spend money only when it's really necessary. For example, use your local library for books instead of cluttering up your space with expensive tomes that you'll probably only read once, if at all.

Spend Money To Save Money

This advice may sound like an oxymoron, but many real-life examples can point the way to you saving some serious bucks. For example, take your car in for scheduled maintenance, and don't skip your six-month dental cleaning and checkup. These preventive strategies may be painful to your pocket, but deferring maintenance—whether for yourself personally or on items you own—could lead to a lot more pain and expenses down the road.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the purpose of a budget?

Budgeting helps you to make a plan for your financial life and track how well you're sticking to that plan. Instead of wondering where your money went at the end of the month, you can make a proactive plan for how you want to use it to attain financial freedom and independence rather than getting trapped in debt.

How do I stick to a budget?

People have trouble sticking to their budgets for a variety of reasons, so getting on track will depend on your particular struggles. It could be that your budget is unrealistic or that your budgeting process is too cumbersome, or it could be that you need motivators to help you improve your self-control. Try to figure out where the problem lies so you can address it with the appropriate solution.

How do you budget money on a low income?

Many budgeting principles apply regardless of your income level. However, a lower income can present challenges for fitting all of the essentials in. As usual, the place to start is to review all of your expenses and compare them to your income. Then, you can begin making decisions about where to cut spending. If you're still having trouble making the budget work, you may want to explore additional ways to bring money in. Finally, if you're struggling to make ends meet, consider options for rental assistance, help with utilities, or debt counseling.

MOMO PRODUCTIONS / GETTY IMAGES

In times of economic uncertainty, employers need to consider that some employees can’t just rely on benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Many workers may be looking for more immediate help to cover emergencies and expenses they otherwise can’t manage.

According to Pew Research Center, fewer than one in four lower-income workers in the U.S. have enough extra funds to cover three months of expenses, let alone those that are unexpected.1 With that said, people who had emergency funds might’ve exhausted them by now to make ends meet during recent trying times. This lack of emergency funds can have an impact on people’s ability to take care of some of their most basic expenses. For example, 15% of adult renters were not caught up on rent as of March 2021, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).2

Some employers are addressing these concerns by creating emergency savings plans—accounts that can be funded with automatic deposits through payroll deductions to help pay for critical costs like housing, food, and transportation.

Here’s why these employer-sponsored emergency funds could be essential, and how your company may be able to assist you in times of need.

How an Employer-Sponsored Emergency Savings Plan Works

Employer-sponsored emergency savings plans exist in a few different forms, but they all serve the same purpose: Giving employees access to a liquid account when they need immediate cash. 

For instance, in October 2020, shipping company UPS partnered with financial nonprofit Commonwealth to introduce an emergency fund plan for its 90,000 non-union workers.3 This plan is similar to a retirement account, where employees contribute a percentage of their pay through payroll deductions. 

Note

If your employer offers a savings account or plan, check to see if it also offers contribution matching. This perk might be more attractive to those employees who wouldn’t otherwise contribute to an emergency fund, while also helping to beef up their balances. 

There are a few common employer-sponsored emergency savings plans that your company may offer. You could have an in-plan option, where your employer offers an account that supplements your retirement plan, but is used to help prevent you from dipping into your retirement savings early. Another option may be a separate program through a bank or credit union that allows you to save money.

After-tax employee 401(k) accounts: Employers and workers could make after-tax contributions to an emergency fund that’s administered by the same group that runs the company’s 401(k). While earnings are taxed and subject to penalties upon withdrawal, your after-tax contributions are not, making that money more liquid than your pre-tax 401(k) contributions. 
Deemed Roth IRAs under a 401(k) plan: This works similar to a 401(k) account but earnings are withdrawn tax-free because with Roth plans, you are contributing after-tax dollars, though earnings may still be subject to taxes and penalties.
Depository institution accounts: Some companies may not offer retirement plans, but can encourage emergency savings through depository accounts—savings plans at banks or credit unions that are easily accessible and FDIC-insured.4

If you were to leave the company, the type of account could determine how you get that money. For instance, money in a retirement 401(k) might get rolled over into an individual retirement account (IRA). On the other hand, with an employer-sponsored emergency savings account, money in a depository institution might mean you just need to transfer that money to a different account outside of what the company established. 

Note

If you want to set up a plan at your company, talk to your human resources (HR) department about options and what could work best for employees. You may also need to consult your current retirement plan sponsor to see if they have any options as well.

Some of the questions you may want to ask HR and plan sponsors include: 

What’s the maximum threshold for savings? 
Is there a company match? 
Can you set up automatic payroll deductions?
How do you access the money in the account? 

You can also use the Compliance Assistance Statement of Terms (CAST) template provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for some general guidelines.

Pros and Cons of Employer-Sponsored Emergency Savings Plans
Pros
Fast funds, less penalties
Option for companies without retirement plans
Waived fees and charges
Cons
No guarantee of employer matching contribution
Less money for the long term
Additional employer expense
Pros Explained
Fast Funds, Less Penalties

Giving workers quick access to a savings or other type of easily accessible account can be crucial to their financial well-being. Savings accounts may help deter employees from tapping into retirement savings in times of need. Even if you did choose to withdraw funds early from your retirement plan to cover expenses, it may take several weeks for you to actually get that money and it could come with taxes and penalties that ultimately reduce the amount you receive.5 In times of an economic crisis or downturn, people need money right away without penalties.

Option for Companies Without Retirement Plans

Employers that don’t offer retirement plans can still offer emergency savings plans by opening accounts at banks or other financial institutions. This could give you quick access to funds without the red tape of a 401(k) or similar retirement plan.

Waived Fees and Charges

Some people may skip opening traditional savings accounts for fear of not meeting minimum saving or deposit requirements. An employer-sponsored savings plan may cover the fees and charges that you would otherwise have to pay.

Note

Employer-sponsored emergency savings accounts could also help reduce employee stress and lead to increased productivity.

Cons Explained
No Guarantee of Employer Matching Contributions

While workers contributing to their own savings plans are important, employers matching contributions means workers can double their deposits. These incentives could increase employee participation in plans they might not otherwise get involved in. However, while you might have the opportunity to contribute to a savings account through work, there’s still the chance that your employer doesn’t offer matching contributions.

Less Money for the Long Term 

For low and moderate earners who are already struggling to save for retirement, putting money into an emergency savings plan could mean putting less money—or no money at all—into a retirement account. This already adds to the worrying fact that many Americans have less than $100,000 saved for retirement, according to a January 2020 survey by TD Ameritrade.6

Additional Employer Expense

With new accounts comes new fees for employers. Small businesses or companies already running lean due to the pandemic might not be able to afford additional fees and expenses right now, or have the administrative bandwidth to execute. And that means your company may not be able to offer this option even if you pitch it to your HR department.

The Bottom Line

As the public health crisis and economic downturn significantly impacts many households, you may need more immediate financial assistance—especially through your employer. 

If you think an employer-sponsored emergency savings plan is right for your company, talk to your HR department and potential plan sponsors. They can look into implementing a plan and addressing the fiscal, logistical, and operational issues that come with it. In the process, you may be able to have managers and leadership teams gather thoughts and feedback from other employees via anonymous surveys and group or one-on-one meetings. If your company is able to offer this rainy-day option, it could potentially be pivotal to your financial stability.

Money is a tool that can help you to achieve your goals. It can provide comfort and stability for your family, make it easier to plan for the future, and allow you to save towards important milestones. But to achieve these things, you need to know how to make your money work for you.

What Does It Mean To Make Your Money Work For You?

Making your money work for you means taking control of your finances, then using that control to continuously improve your financial stability and security.

You may eventually be able to gain financial independence or build wealth through investing. But neither of those things can happen without first understanding where your money is going and learning better ways to use it.

Learn To Budget

A budget is a vital tool for changing the way you handle your money.

When you are budgeting, you understand where your money is coming from and are purposeful about where you spend it. You are making your money do what you want it to do, rather than spending without a plan.

Note

The goal of budgeting is to always spend less than you earn.

When you create a budget, you assign every dollar you earn to a spending category. You can use a budget to:

Reduce your spending
Understand where your money is going
Identify bad financial habits
Pay off debt
Avoid creating new debt
Prioritize spending on things that are important to you
Save for the future1

Budgeting is not a one-time action. It should be something you actively engage in every day. You may need to adjust your budget from month to month to account for large expenses or your own spending habits.

When you know how much income you have, you can decide where to put it. When you are deliberate about where you spend it, you are in control of your money. This is the first step towards making it work the way you want to, rather than feeling controlled by your finances.

Get Out of Debt

When you are in debt, you pay more than the cost of the original purchase. You also have to make interest payments that can substantially cut into your income.

Debt means your money isn't working for you, it's going towards paying that interest. It creates a financial burden and limits the choices that you can make.

Paying off debt, by contrast, allows you to take that money and redirect it toward the things that are important to you. You can put it toward other financial goals, such as saving for education, creating a retirement fund, traveling, or improving your living situation. You can start a business. You can begin investing it, allowing you to grow your wealth and create more financial stability and independence.

If you have a lot of debt and are feeling overwhelmed, you can use the snowball method to control the debt repayment process.

Pay only the minimum payment on all your debts except the smallest one.
Put whatever extra money you have toward paying off the smallest debt.
Once it's paid off, move onto the next smallest.

As you pay off your smaller debts, you'll have more money available to pay off your larger debts. This momentum helps you focus your efforts and get out of debt more quickly.2﻿ 

Create an Emergency Fund

Surprises are scary when you do not have control of your finances. An unexpected car repair, a medical procedure, a job loss, or any other financial emergency can quickly send you spiraling into new or more debt, wiping out any progress you've made towards taking control of your money.

Creating an emergency fund is another way to make your money work for you because it means you have planned for surprises. If an emergency does come up, you can put the money in your fund to work and regain control of the situation.

Building an emergency fund can take time. Ideally, you should save the equivalent of three to six months' worth of income. But every little bit you can set aside will help. If you are still paying off debt or don't have much wiggle room in your budget, set aside whatever you can in a ""surprise expenses"" category in your budget. At the end of the month, transfer whatever is in this category to a separate savings account.

Note

Put your emergency savings in a high-yield savings account, which will earn more interest than a regular saving or checking account. This means that the money you save will make money while it's sitting in your bank account. If your bank doesn't offer high-yield accounts or you live in a rural area without a bank, look for online banking options to open an account.

Once you are out of debt or have more money free money in your budget, you can set up larger recurring contributions to grow your emergency fund even faster.3﻿

Save and Invest Your Money

Once you have freed up all that extra money from paying off your debt, you can put your money to work through savings and investments. What you save for will depend on your age, lifestyle, and goals.

In addition to an emergency fund, you will also need retirement accounts. You should also consider whether you need:

Education savings, for yourself or your children
Travel savings
A down payment fund for a house
Savings to start a business
A car fund, for repairs or a new vehicle
Extracurricular fund for dependents
Long-term care savings, for yourself or dependents

By creating designated savings funds, you can track your progress toward specific goals. You can also put those savings in a high-interest account, money market account or CD (certificate of deposit) in order to earn interest on your money.

Note

Remember, when you pay interest, you are losing money. But when you earn interest, your money is making more money all by itself.

If you won't need your savings for several years or decades, one of the best ways to make your money work for you is to invest.

When you put your money into investments, it grows all on its own through interest or the increased value of the thing you invested in. Some investments also pay dividends, which you can either take as extra income or reinvest to help your portfolio grow.

Note

Investing is a long-term strategy for building wealth. The most successful investors invest early, then allow their money to grow for years or decades before using it as income. Constantly buying and selling investments is likely to make less money than a buy-and-hold strategy in the long run.

As you start investing, it is important to diversify your portfolio. Having all your money in just one type of investment increases your risk. If that single investment fails, all your money could be gone. Instead, spread that risk out by investing in a mix of:

Stocks
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Government bonds
Mutual funds
Real estate
Business (your own or someone else's)4
Note

Many mutual funds or brokerage firms have a minimum amount for first-time investors. You may need to save up that minimum amount before you start investing. In the meantime, you can start small with investing apps that allow you to purchase fractional shares by investing amounts as small as $1 at a time.

No matter how you are saving or investing, have a specific set of goals. Know what you are working towards, like paying for your child's education, purchasing a home, or early retirement. This will help focus your spending and give you motivation, as well as helping you decide what types of investments are the best for you.

THE BALANCE / JULIE BANG

The Greek debt crisis is the dangerous amount of sovereign debt Greece owed the European Union between 2008 and 2018. In 2010, Greece said it might default on its debt, threatening the viability of the eurozone itself.1

To avoid default, the EU loaned Greece enough to continue making payments.

Note

Since the debt crisis began in 2010, the various European authorities and private investors have loaned Greece nearly 320 billion euros.

It was the biggest financial rescue of a bankrupt country in history.2 As of January 2019, Greece has only repaid 41.6 billion euros. It has scheduled debt payments beyond 2060.

In return for the loan, the EU required Greece to adopt austerity measures. These reforms were intended to strengthen the Greek government and financial structures. They did that, but they also mired Greece in a recession that didn’t end until 2017.

The crisis triggered the eurozone debt crisis, creating fears that it would spread into a global financial crisis. It warned of the fate of other heavily indebted EU members. This massive crisis was triggered by a country whose economic output is no bigger than the U.S. State of Connecticut.3

Greece Crisis Explained

In 2009, Greece’s budget deficit exceeded 15% of its gross domestic product.2 Fear of default widened the 10-year bond spread and ultimately led to the collapse of Greece’s bond market. This would shut down Greece’s ability to finance further debt repayments. The chart below highlights in red the period when the 10-year government bond yield passed 35% until vast debt restructuring forced private bondholders to accept investment losses in exchange for less debt.

EU leaders struggled to agree on a solution. Greece wanted the EU to forgive some of the debt, but the EU didn’t want to let Greece off scot-free.

The biggest lenders were Germany and its bankers. They championed austerity measures. They believed the measures would improve Greece's comparative advantage in the global marketplace. The austerity measures required Greece to improve how it managed its public finances. It had to modernize its financial statistics and reporting. It lowered trade barriers, increasing exports.

Most importantly, the measures required Greece to reform its pension system. Pension payments had absorbed 17.5% of GDP, higher than in any other EU country. Public pensions were 9% underfunded, compared to 3% for other nations. Austerity measures required Greece to cut pensions by 1% of GDP. It also required a higher pension contribution by employees and limited early retirement.4

Half of Greek households relied on pension income since one out of five Greeks were 65 or older.5 Workers weren’t thrilled paying contributions so seniors can receive higher pensions. 

The austerity measures forced the government to cut spending and increase taxes. They cost 72 billion euros or 40% of GDP. As a result, the Greek economy shrank 25%. That reduced the tax revenues needed to repay the debt. Unemployment rose to 25%, while youth unemployment hit 50%.6 Rioting broke out in the streets. The political system was in upheaval as voters turned to anyone who promised a painless way out. 

The results are mixed. In 2017, Greece ran a budget surplus of 0.8%.7 Its economy grew 1.4%, but unemployment was still 22%.8 One-third of the population lived below the poverty line. Its 2017 debt-to-GDP ratio was 182%.

Timeline

In 2009, Greece announced its budget deficit would be 12.9% of its GDP.2 That's more than four times the EU's 3% limit. Rating agencies Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's lowered Greece's credit ratings. That scared off investors and raised the cost of future loans.

In 2010, Greece announced a plan to lower its deficit to 3% of GDP in two years. Greece attempted to reassure the EU lenders it was fiscally responsible. Just four months later, Greece instead warned it might default.2

The EU and the International Monetary Fund provided 240 billion euros in emergency funds in return for austerity measures. The loans only gave Greece enough money to pay interest on its existing debt and keep banks capitalized. The EU had no choice but to stand behind its member by funding a bailout. Otherwise, it would face the consequences of Greece either leaving the Eurozone or defaulting.9 Austerity measures required Greece to increase the VAT tax and the corporate tax rate. It had to close tax loopholes. It created an independent tax collector to reduce tax evasion. It reduced incentives for early retirement. It raised worker contributions to the pension system. At the same time, it reduced wages to lower the cost of goods and boost exports. The measures required Greece to privatize many state-owned businesses such as electricity transmission. That limited the power of socialist parties and unions. 

Why was the EU so harsh? EU leaders and bond rating agencies wanted to make sure Greece wouldn't use the new debt to pay off the old. Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain had already used austerity measures to strengthen their own economies. Since they were paying for the bailouts, they wanted Greece to follow their examples. Some EU countries like Slovakia and Lithuania refused to ask their taxpayers to dig into their pockets to let Greece off the hook.10 These countries had just endured their own austerity measures to avoid bankruptcy with no help from the EU. 

In 2011, the European Financial Stability Facility added 190 billion euros to the bailout. Despite the name change, that money also came from EU countries.

By 2012, Bondholders finally agreed to a haircut, exchanging 77 billion euros in bonds for debt worth 75% less.

In 2014, Greece’s economy appeared to be recovering, as it grew 0.7%. The government successfully sold bonds and balanced the budget.

In January 2015, voters elected the Syriza party to fight the hated austerity measures. On June 27, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on the measures. He falsely promised that a ""no"" vote would give Greece more leverage to negotiate a 30% debt relief with the EU. On June 30, 2015, Greece missed its scheduled 1.55 billion euros payment.11 Both sides called it a delay, not an official default. Two days later, the IMF warned that Greece needed 60 billion euros in new aid. It told creditors to take further write-downs on the more than 300 billion euros Greece owed them. 

On July 5, Greek voters said ""no"" to austerity measures.12 The instability created a run on the banks. Greece sustained extensive economic damage during the two weeks surrounding the vote. Banks closed and restricted ATM withdrawals to 60 euros per day. It threatened the tourism industry at the height of the season, with 14 million tourists visiting the country. The European Central Bank agreed to recapitalize Greek banks with 10 billion euros to 25 billion euros, allowing them to reopen.13

Banks imposed a 420 euros weekly limit on withdrawals. That prevented depositors from draining their accounts and worsening the problem. It also helped reduce tax evasion. People turned to debit and credit cards for purchases. As a result, federal revenue increased by 1 billion euros a year.

On July 15, the Greek parliament passed the austerity measures despite the referendum.14 Otherwise, it would not receive the EU loan of 86 billion euros. The ECB agreed with the IMF to reduce Greece’s debt. It lengthened the terms, thus reducing net present value. Greece would still owe the same amount. It could just pay it over a longer time period. 

On July 20, Greece made its payment to the ECB, thanks to a loan of 7 billion euros from the EU emergency fund. The United Kingdom demanded the other EU members guarantee its contribution to the bailout.

On September 20, Tsipras and the Syriza party won a snap election.15 It gave them the mandate to continue to press for debt relief in negotiations with the EU. However, they also had to continue with the unpopular reforms promised to the EU. 

In November, Greece's four biggest banks privately raised 14.4 euros billion as required by the ECB.16 The funds covered bad loans and returned the banks to full functionality. Almost half of the loans banks had on their books were in danger of default. Bank investors contributed this amount in exchange for the 86 billion euros in bailout loans. The economy contracted 0.2%.

In March 2016, the Bank of Greece predicted the economy would return to growth by the summer. It only shrank 0.2% in 2015, but the Greek banks were still losing money. They were reluctant to call in bad debt, believing that their borrowers would repay once the economy improved. That tied up funds they could have lent to new ventures. 

On June 17, the EU's European Stability Mechanism disbursed 7.5 billion euros to Greece.17 It planned to use the funds to pay interest on its debt. Greece continued with austerity measures. It passed legislation to modernize the pension and income tax systems. It promised to privatize more companies, and sell off nonperforming loans. 

In May 2017, Tsipras agreed to cut pensions and broaden the tax base. In return, the EU loaned Greece another 86 billion euros.13 Greece used it to make more debt payments. Tsipras hoped that his conciliatory tone would help him reduce the 293.2 billion euros in outstanding debt. But the German government wouldn't concede much before its September presidential elections. 

In July, Greece was able to issue bonds for the first time since 2014. It planned to swap notes issued in the restructuring with the new notes as a move to regain investors' trust.

On January 15, 2018, the Greek parliament agreed on new austerity measures to qualify for the next round of bailouts. On January 22, the eurozone finance ministers approved 6 billion to 7 billion euros.13 The new measures made it more difficult for union strikes to paralyze the country. They helped banks reduce bad debt, opened up the energy and pharmacy markets, and recalculated child benefits.

On August 20, 2018, the bailout program ended.2 Most of the outstanding debt is owed to the EU emergency funding entities. These are primarily funded by German banks.

European Financial Stability Mechanism and European Stability Mechanism: 168 billion euros
Eurozone governments: 53 billion euros.
Private investors: 34 billion euros.
Greek government bond holders: 15 billion euros.
European Central Bank: 13 billion euros.
IMF: 12 billion euros. 

Until the debt is repaid, European creditors will informally supervise adherence to existing austerity measures. The deal means that no new measures would be created.

Causes

How did Greece and the EU get into this mess in the first place? The seeds were sown back in 2001 when Greece adopted the euro as its currency. Greece had been an EU member since 1981 but couldn't enter the eurozone. Its budget deficit had been too high for the eurozone's Maastricht Criteria.3 

All went well for the first several years. Like other eurozone countries, Greece benefited from the power of the euro. It lowered interest rates and brought in investment capital and loans.

In 2004, Greece announced it had lied to get around the Maastricht Criteria.18 The EU imposed no sanctions. Why not? There were three reasons.

France and Germany were also spending above the limit at the time. They'd be hypocritical to sanction Greece until they imposed their own austerity measures first.

There was uncertainty on exactly what sanctions to apply. They could expel Greece, but that would be disruptive and weaken the euro.

The EU wanted to strengthen the power of the euro in international currency markets. A strong euro would convince other EU countries, like the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, to adopt the euro.

As a result, Greek debt continued to rise until the crisis erupted in 2008.

Why Greece Didn't Leave the Eurozone

Greece could have abandoned the euro and reinstated the drachma. Without the austerity measures, the Greek government could have hired new workers. It would have lowered the 25% unemployment rate and boosted economic growth. Greece could have converted its euro-based debt to drachmas, printed more currency and lowered its euro exchange rate. That would have reduced its debt, lowered the cost of exports, and attracted tourists to a cheaper vacation destination.

At first, that would seem ideal for Greece, but foreign owners of Greek debt would have suffered debilitating losses as the drachma plummeted. That would debase the value of repayments in their own currency. Some banks would go bankrupt. Most of the debt is owned by European governments, whose taxpayers would foot the bill.

Plummeting drachma values would have triggered hyperinflation, as the cost of imports skyrocketed. Greece imports 40% of its food and pharmaceuticals and 80% of its energy.19

Many companies refused to export these items to a country that might not pay its bills. The country couldn't attract new foreign direct investment in such an unstable situation. The only countries that would have lent to Greece are Russia and China. In the long run, Greece would find itself back to where it began: burdened with debt it couldn't repay. 

Interest rates on other indebted countries would have risen. Rating agencies would worry they'd leave the euro also. The value of the euro itself would have weakened as currency traders use the crisis as a reason to bet against it. 

Why Greece Didn't Default

A widespread Greek default would have a more immediate effect. First, Greek banks would have gone bankrupt without loans from the European Central Bank. Losses would have threatened the solvency of other European banks, particularly in Germany and France. They, along with other private investors, held 34.1 billion euros in Greek debt.20

Eurozone governments owned 52.9 billion euros. That's in addition to the 131 billion euros owned by the EFSF, essentially also eurozone governments. Germany owned the most debt, but it was a tiny percentage of its GDP. Much of the debt didn't come due until 2020 or later. Smaller countries faced a more serious situation. Finland's portion of the debt was 10% of its annual budget. The ECB held 26.9 billion euros of Greek debt.

If Greece had defaulted, the ECB would have been fine. It was unlikely that other indebted countries would have defaulted. 

For these reasons, a Greek default wouldn’t have been worse than the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management debt crisis. That's when Russia's default led to a tidal wave of defaults in other emerging market countries. The IMF prevented many defaults by providing capital until their economies had improved. The IMF owns 21.1 billion euros of Greek debt, not enough to deplete it.21

The differences would be the scale of defaults and that they are in developed markets. It would affect the source of much of the IMF's funds. The United States wouldn’t be able to help. While a huge backer of IMF funding, it's now deep in debt, itself. There would be no political appetite for an American bailout of European sovereign debt. 

Outlook

Despite austerity measures, many aspects of Greece’s economy are still problematic. Government spending makes up 48% of the GDP while EU bailouts contribute around 3%.22 As of 2017, Greece relies on tourism for 20% of GDP. Bureaucracy often delays commercial investments for decades. The government has shrunk, but it is still inefficient. There is too much political patronage. Government decision-making is centralized, further slowing response time.

This bureaucracy, combined with unclear property rights and judicial obstacles, has kept Greece from selling 50 billion euros worth of state-owned assets. Only 6 billion euros worth of property has been sold since 2011.

Tax evasion has gone underground as more people operate in the black economy. It now comprises 21.5% of GDP. As a result, fewer people are paying higher taxes to receive less from the government than they did before the crisis.

Many of the jobs available are part-time and pay less than before the crisis. As a result, hundreds of thousands of the best and brightest have left the country. Banks haven’t completely recuperated, and are hesitant to make new loans to businesses. It will be a slow road to recovery.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
When did the Greek debt crisis begin?

The Greek debt crisis began in 2009. The country revealed that the budget deficit had surpassed 15% of GDP. This borrowing spike relative to productivity caused credit agencies to downgrade Greek debt.2

How did the Greek debt crisis affect the American economy?

The U.S. did not directly assist Greece during its debt crisis, so it didn't feel an immediate impact. Europe is a major trade partner with the U.S., so the severe impact on Europe's economy did pose some threat to American economic stability, but the Greek debt crisis wasn't a direct threat in and of itself.9
