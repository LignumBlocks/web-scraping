Financial blind spots are those areas of your money management you never quite get to or financial tasks you might not even be aware of. 

Even if your finances are on track, don’t get overconfident and assume you have everything under control, warned Melissa Joy, a certified financial planner (CFP) and president of Pearl Planning. “You might lean into things you understand, like asset allocations or managing fees,” Joy said. “But then you leave other things unaddressed and don’t get around to some very basic things.” 

Learning about common financial blind spots and what to watch for can help you figure out how to cover your bases. Here are some common sources of financial blind spots and how to address each one.

Key Takeaways
You don’t have to spend money to make money, but you can invest your time and money to generate future wealth.
Consider whether money guidelines work for you, or whether another strategy is a better fit.
Remember that your history with money has shaped how you think about personal finance.
Now is the best time to start working toward financial goals, like saving for retirement or paying off debt.
You Don’t Have To ‘Spend Money To Make Money’

You’ve probably heard the saying “You need to spend money to make money.” Perhaps you’ve even heard it from a high school acquaintance trying to convince you to join their multi-level marketing team, or a marketer trying to sell you a professional development course. But proceed cautiously: It’s far too easy to default to spending money when you believe that every dollar you spend will result in more earnings later. 

“Watch out for people who tell you that you have to or must do certain things in order to ensure one result,” said Kayla Walter, a CFP who focuses on helping single millennial women, in an email to The Balance.

There is some truth to the phrase if you shift it slightly: You have to offer up something of value to make money. “You have to be wise with the money that you earn so that it can make money for you,” Walter advised. Look for ways to invest your time, energy, and resources (including money) to create value that will generate future income and wealth. 

Don’t Let Money Guidelines Rule Your Finances

General finance rules can give us a helpful starting point when we’re developing money management skills. But treating these guidelines like absolutes can also create financial blind spots if it means we miss out on other potential solutions and options.

Take tax refunds, for example. Many people think getting a tax refund is a bad thing, said Riley Adams, a CPA and founder of personal finance site Young and the Invested, in an email to The Balance. 

“Sure, you lose access to the money and don’t earn anything on it while it sits in Uncle Sam’s accounts,” Adams said. “But what’s the alternative?” Getting that money in your pocket sooner as part of each paycheck doesn’t mean you’ll use it wisely. For many people, having taxes deducted from their paychecks is a form of forced saving, and getting a lump-sum tax refund could be more financially beneficial than receiving slightly larger paychecks throughout the year.

Ultimately, your money moves don’t always have to follow the “rules” or make sense to others—if it works for you, it works. 

Don’t Compare Yourself to Others

“One of the biggest financial blind spots is constant comparison, especially with social media,” said Courtney LaCalamito, CPA and owner of financial website Your Average Dough, via email. It’s all too easy to get the idea that you’re the only person who’s not investing in cryptocurrencies, doesn’t own a home, or can’t afford an annual overseas vacation. 

But be careful of such status-based comparisons. “This envy of others’ lifestyles can lead people to give up on their money goals or get into financial trouble because they want what other people have,” LaCalamito adds. 

The impulse to compare can be used constructively when you look for money role models, Adams suggested. “People can become more aware of their financial weaknesses and blind spots by looking at the way other people live and then comparing this to their own situation,” he said. 

You might feel jealous when you hear a friend has paid off their student loans or credit card debt, for example. But you could reframe this feeling and instead use your friend as inspiration for your own debt payoff journey. You could even ask them for tips on how they did it, so you can take advantage of some of their strategies.

Your History With Money Matters

A major source of financial blind spots is your own financial background and history, according to Walter. “A lot of people believe that money is something that is outside of us. But how we spend money actually has a lot to do with our psychology and the things we’ve learned subconsciously growing up,” she explained. 

In fact, research suggests that the majority of our money behaviors and beliefs are set by the time we’re 7 years old.1 And we all have certain “money scripts” or default attitudes and beliefs about money. For example, if you grew up hearing your parents complain about never having enough money and suggesting life would be easier with more, you might have internalized a “money worship” script. As an adult, this script could make you feel like you’re never quite satisfied with your finances and believe that you’d be happier if you earned more money.2

“How people spend their money now is a direct result of the environment that they were raised in and how they saw other people around them handling money,” Walter said. To understand your financial tendencies and blind spots, reflect on your upbringing and what it did—or didn’t—teach you about money. 

You Can’t Expect Retirement To Fall Into Place

Retirement planning is a commonly procrastinated financial task, Joy said. “People know they’re behind, or not doing well enough, and that makes them freeze up,” she explained.

For example, consider that in one survey, 49% of women and 33% of men couldn’t estimate how much money they’d need in retirement.3 While Social Security benefits fund 27% of retirement costs on average, 20% of people say they don’t expect Social Security to exist when they retire.4 Shifting tax policies and health care costs can also make it feel impossible to adequately plan for your future needs.

“You don’t know what will come up in life,” Joy added. “There will be times when you’re dealing with adversities you couldn’t have expected.” 

So how can you deal with that uncertainty? Look ahead to your retirement date and start to think about what you want your life to look like, how much you plan to spend, and how much you’ll need to save to support that lifestyle. Online retirement calculators and projection tools can be a helpful starting point.

Then, make a plan based on your current trajectory. “The process of financial planning is iterative,” Joy added, not a one-time thing. “You head in the right direction, manage your actions, and adjust course as you know more.” It’s important to create a flexible retirement plan and be ready to pivot as needed.

Right Now Is the Best Time To Work Toward Financial Goals

Finally, the timing of financial moves can be another blind spot. You can easily end up at either end of the timeline extremes: feeling pressured to check off all your money goals ASAP or endlessly procrastinating on starting to work toward them. Whether you’re rushing ahead or dragging your feet on your finances, both can create blind spots with your money.

Now is the best time to work toward financial goals. But instead of trying to tackle everything at once, pick just one goal and break it down into small weekly or daily actions. LaCalamito recommends researching some options for that goal, then experimenting to find an approach that works for you. “Since humans are all wired differently, what works for one person may not work for the next,” she said. 

Whether it’s building an emergency fund, saving for a big goal, or paying down debt, the actions you take as you work toward a money goal will start to become habits. And as you upgrade your finances in one area, it naturally lays the groundwork for your next money move. “Just like there’s compounding power with interest, there’s compounding power in good financial decisions,” Joy said.

If you live in New York and are planning to put a child through college, you can receive a substantial tax deduction by contributing to New York's 529 College Savings Program.

529 plans offer tax-advantaged ways to save money, because investments made in these accounts grow tax-free and all withdrawals used for qualified higher education expenses are exempt from federal income tax. New York is one of 34 states and the District of Columbia that offer residents a tax deduction or tax credit for 529 plan contributions.1

Two 529 Savings Plan Options

The more you can save through a 529 plan, the less stress you'll have when it's time to apply for financial aid or search for scholarships. Through these tax-deductible plans, family members and friends can contribute to a child's college fund and get a tax benefit for doing so. Over the years, with regular contributions and compound interest, the plan can grow significantly to provide for the child's educational expenses.

New York's 529 College Savings Program offers two plan options:

The Direct Plan, which is administered directly by the Program
The Advisor Plan, which is sold through financial advisors
The Direct Plan

The New York 529 College Savings Program Direct Plan is managed by Vanguard and Ascensus and offers three age-based portfolio options—conservative, moderate, and aggressive—and 13 individual fund portfolio options.23

Note

Age-based portfolios shift their asset allocation over time from aggressive to increasingly conservative as the student approaches college age. This strategy is designed to maximize potential for growth in the early years and then conserve principal and earnings closer to tuition time.

There are no fees and no minimum contribution amount necessary to open the plan. You'll pay a 0.12% annual asset-based fee when you open the account, or $1.20 in fees per year for each $1,000 you contribute to the plan.4

The Advisor Plan

The other option is New York's Advisor-Guided 529 plan, which is an advisor-sold plan that offers a mix of multi-fund investments as well as individual mutual funds.

Your advisor can help you choose from three distinct approaches to underlying funds: age-based, asset allocation, or individual. This program requires an initial minimum contribution made in one of the following ways:

$25 per month or $75 per quarter by recurring contribution
$25 per month by payroll direct deposit
$1,000 by personal check or electronic bank transfer.5

You can also roll over another 529 plan to this account or transfer funds from a savings bond, Coverdell savings account, or Uniform Gifts to Minor Act (UGMA) account.

Account fees are $15 annually for account maintenance (unless holdings are more than $25,000) plus a 0.25% annualized program management fee. Also, the underlying funds within each portfolio have their own share of fees and expenses, which are detailed in the prospectus for the fund.6

Overview of the Tax Deduction

You can contribute up to $520,000 per beneficiary. Come tax time, you may deduct up to $5,000 of your contributions from New York State taxable income, or a total of $10,000 for married filers filing jointly.6﻿

Note

For non-resident New York taxpayers, deductions may vary. State tax deductions may be subject to recapture in certain circumstances, such as rollovers to another state's 529 plan or non-qualified withdrawals. Consult a tax advisor for more information about your specific situation.

New York residents do not need to itemize their other deductions to claim a benefit from their New York 529 College Savings Program. Even if you are not able to deduct anything else, you’ll still be able to deduct your contributions to the plan from your gross income. 

As with most states, distributions from the direct plan that are not used for qualified education expenses are subject to taxation, and also a possible recapture of deductions taken in previous years.47

If you are a New Yorker trying to choose between the 529 college savings program and other college savings vehicles, account for the potential tax savings of the New York deduction for residents when making your decision.

Tax deductions reduce your taxable income, and therefore the amount of tax you owe. New York state income tax rates range from 4% to 8.82%, so your contribution could reduce your tax obligation accordingly. If your New York taxable income falls in the 6.85% tax bracket, a reduction of $5,000 in taxable income could potentially save you $342.50 in taxes.

Remember that New Yorkers may only receive a deduction for contributing to the New York 529 plan and not for plans from any other state.

It's important to become familiar with the options available for education saving, such as different account types and tax benefits, if you're a Michigan resident planning to put your child through college.

The state of Michigan provides tax benefits to you if you choose to contribute to the state's 529 College Savings Plans. You may find some relief from the burden of college costs when you understand the available savings options and the people they're designed to help. These programs can lessen the burden of financial aid debt.

Tax Benefits of 529 Plans

Michigan is one of 33 states that offer residents a tax deduction or tax credit for saving for education. The goal of these plans is to provide tools for people who are looking for ways to save for college while giving a generous state tax deduction.

You can allow family and friends to make deposits in addition to making your own deposits into the account. Contributions may be eligible for a federal annual gift tax exclusion if they make deposits of less than $16,000 (single) or $32,000 (married) per year in 2022.1

Because these plans are investment strategies designed to increase in value, the investments made in these accounts can grow free from federal and Michigan state taxation. The money you withdraw and use for qualified higher education expenses is exempt from federal and state income taxes.2

Note

Qualified expenses include tuition, certain types of room and board costs, computers, related technology, books, fees, and equipment.

Michigan's Options

Michigan offers a few options for its residents. The Michigan Education Savings Program (MESP) is a direct-sold 529 savings plan managed by TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing. The plan offers a choice of four investment options.2 These options vary in their investment strategy and degree of risk, allowing investors to select an option or a combination of options that fit their individual needs.

The State of Michigan, Allianz Global Investors Distributors, and TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing Inc. have created a flexible, advisor-sold 529 plan to assist residents wanting to save for college. You can choose from 10 enrollment year investment portfolios, two target-risk investment portfolios, one multi-fund investment portfolio, and 16 individual investment portfolios. These portfolios vary based on investment strategy and underlying risks.3

Michigan also offers a prepaid tuition program, the Michigan Education Trust (MET), which is open to Michigan beneficiaries. MET contracts offer three purchase options: a lump sum payment, pay as you go, and monthly payments.

Tax Benefits of MI 529 College Savings Plans

The maximum account balance for an MI 529 plan is $500,000. Contributors to MI 529 Plans can receive a state income tax deduction of up to $5,000 per year for each adult filer or $10,000 for joint filers.4

Even if a Michigan resident contributes large amounts on behalf of multiple beneficiaries, they can only deduct a maximum of $5,000 for a single return, or $10,000 for a joint return each year. Any amount contributed over the limit is not deductible and may not be carried forward.

Value of the Michigan 529 Plan Deduction

Michigan residents who are trying to decide whether to use the Michigan 529 plan versus a college savings plan from another state must account for the potential tax savings of contributing to their in-state plan. Michigan does not offer a tax deduction to residents contributing to out-of-state plans.

Michigan has a flat income tax rate of 4.25%, so the full deduction of $5,000 can save a taxpayer up to $212.50 at tax time.45 Michigan does not offer a tax deduction for contributing to other types of college savings accounts, such as a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) or a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) Custodial Account.

Claiming the Tax Deduction

The Michigan 529 plan deduction is an ""above the line"" income adjustment. This allows residents to claim it even if they don't itemize their other deductions, opting for the standard deduction instead. You can take it and itemize or claim the standard deduction, too.

Residents can claim the Michigan 529 plan tax deduction on their Michigan MI-1040 Form. Use Schedule 1 Additions and Subtractions to claim it. Line 17 is for the Michigan Education Savings Program and MI 529 Advisor Plan, and Line 18 is for the Michigan Education Trust.6

Later named Trello, the software grew to over 500,000 users in just one year and 4.75 million by 2014. Three years later, Trello was acquired by Atlassian.9 We chose it as the best project management software because it offers a free, flexible, and visual way to manage projects.

BEST TEAM COMMUNICATION SOFTWARE
Slack
SIGN UP NOW

Slack was originally built as an internal communication tool for a game development company started by Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield in 2009.11 Launched in 2014, it has millions of users in over 150 countries. The company was acquired by Salesforce in 2021, a few years after it went public.1213 We chose it as the best team communication software because it offers real-time messaging, feedback, and collaboration in a free, online platform.

Slack was developed to eliminate the inefficiencies and delays of email communication. The software lets users create channels that can be organized around a topic, team, project, or even a client. Channels can be public and open to all users of a Slack account or private and accessed by invitation only.

Besides communicating in real-time, Slack offers tons of integrations letting teams share files, create polls, schedule meetings, and connect to third-party project management, cloud storage, and productivity tools. The platform offers free, one-click voice and video calls and even lets users spin-off discussion threads to keep larger conversations focused and uncluttered.

One of Slack’s most useful features is its search function. No more sorting through emails or written notes hoping to find that one valuable piece of information. Slack lets users search for a conversation, mention, or user and share or bookmark it no matter how long ago it took place.

We chose it as the best document management software because it offers secure, branded, cloud-based document creation, storage, collaboration, and sharing.

Google Workspace is a great option for small businesses that want to create an efficient, collaborative, cloud-based work environment without having to pay for expensive software or worrying about everyone having the same computer. Because every tool in the Google Workspace platform is a Google product, users can move seamlessly from app to app.

Businesses can start by creating a branded email address using Gmail, one of the most popular mail apps on the marketplace. Other tools include Google Calendars for team scheduling; Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with real-time collaboration; Google Drive for cloud storage; Google Chat for team messaging; and Google Meet for video meetings.

Google Workspace add-ons only access the minimum required data needed to complete an action to ensure that each business’s information stays secure.

What Are Software Programs for Small Businesses?

Software programs for small businesses are designed to make small businesses more efficient by streamlining work, automating processes, and helping with day-to-day tasks which may be taking away from the business owner’s more important duties. These software programs are specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses owners, who can use them to link banks and credit cards, set up business profiles, manage accounting and payroll features, and store documents.

How Much Do Software Programs for Small Businesses Cost?

Software programs for small businesses vary in their functions, features, and capabilities. They also vary in price. There are some free small business software programs. For paid programs, you can expect the cost to range from $5 per user per month to around $20 per user per month. Credit card transaction fees are billed separately.

Are Software Programs for Small Businesses Worth the Cost?

Software programs for small businesses are worth the cost if they increase efficiency and allow the owner or managers to focus more on tasks that bring in money, help the business grow, and meet long-term revenue goals. Software that helps with automation is typically worth the cost so that the owner can focus less on mundane tasks and have more time for serving customers and managing employees.

How We Chose the Best Software Programs for Small Businesses

We thoroughly reviewed and researched the best software programs available to small businesses before deciding on our top choices. We eventually narrowed it down to the best options based on cost, features, functions, integrations, compatibility, and more.

To open a bank account, you'll need to first choose a bank and provide it with some necessary information, including your identification and proof of address. You'll usually need to be 18 to meet the bank's eligibility requirements. Finally, you might need to fund the account or have a minimum balance to avoid fees.

Here's what you need to know about opening a new bank account, including tips on choosing a bank and the type of account.

Key Takeaways
To open an account, you'll need to bring a government-issued ID, your identification number, and your physical and mailing address.
When deciding on an account, you'll want to read the disclosures so you can learn about any account fees or balance minimums.
You can decide what bank or account you want based on the features you're looking for, whether it's high interest rates, low balance minimums, no ATM fees, or something else.
What You Need to Open a Bank Account

When you open a new bank account, you'll need to give the bank or credit union documentation so they can verify your identity.

Have the following items ready:

A government-issued ID (such as a driver’s license, passport, or military ID)
Your identification number
Proof of your physical and mailing address
An initial deposit (if required)

If you don’t have a government-issued ID, you may be able to use another form of ID. Ask your bank what other forms of identification it can accept.

Depending on your situation, your identification number may be your Social Security number, alien identification card number, Individual Tax Payer Identification Number, or another government-issued ID number. If you're a United States citizen, your identification number is most likely your Social Security number.

You'll need to provide this information in some form whether you're opening up an account online or in person.1

Choose a Bank or Credit Union

After you have all of your documents together, you'll want to choose the best bank or credit union for your situation. If you know what type of account you want, you can look for the best deals, whether you're in the market for an online checking account, a high-yield savings account, or something else.

There are three basic categories of financial institutions:

Banks, including community banks and big banks: These might be well-known brands in your local community, or nationwide. They should offer most of the basic services you need, including checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and more.2
Credit unions: A credit union is a customer-owned financial institution that provides many of the same services and products that banks provide. If you opt to join one of these not-for-profit institutions, you'll often enjoy competitive rates because they're not necessarily trying to maximize profits. But that’s not always the case—so review fee schedules carefully.
Online banks and credit unions: These institutions operate entirely online. There’s no branch to visit (or pay for), and you’ll handle most service requests yourself. If you have access to and are comfortable using a computer or mobile device—and performing basic banking transactions—an online bank can help you reduce your fees and earn higher interest rates on savings accounts.3
Note

You might want to have accounts with multiple banks. For example, you may decide to open an online bank account and a brick-and-mortar bank to keep your fees low and maintain the ability to visit an in-person bank if you need to.

Choosing an Account

If you're not sure what type of account you want, consider what your needs are.

Checking accounts: These accounts are typically used to make payments and receive direct deposits.
Savings accounts: These accounts allow you to put your savings aside and earn interest on the money you're not currently using.
Money market accounts: These products sometimes earn slightly more interest than savings accounts (while maintaining your access to cash). You may also have debit and check writing options with these accounts.4
Certificates of deposit (CDs): These products can earn much more than savings accounts but require you to lock up your funds for a certain period.5

Within one of the above categories, a bank may offer multiple products, each with a different name and level of service. These accounts may have different minimum balance thresholds, fees, or interest rates.

A general rule of thumb is to choose an option with a mix of features and fees that meet your needs and budget. For example, if you think you won’t keep a lot of money in the account, you may want to open a bank account with a low initial deposit and low or no minimum balance and fee requirements so you don’t get stuck paying unnecessary fees.

Note

In general, you'll only want to bank where your money is protected by FDIC insurance (or NCUSIF coverage if you use a credit union).

Your Financial History

Your financial history doesn’t need to be impeccable to open a bank account, but it may play into the bank’s decision to approve or deny your application. Your bank or credit union might use ChexSystems, a targeted consumer reporting agency that tracks checking and savings accounts, to determine how much risk a potential customer might pose to the institution where they’re applying for an account. ChexSystems is the banking equivalent of the credit reporting bureaus. 

You don’t necessarily need good credit to get a bank account, but if you're having trouble opening an account, you might want to review your credit report and get a copy of your ChexSystems report.

Opening an Account

Once you've decided on a bank and type of account, you'll need to provide the bank with your information and sign some paperwork.

You’ll have to agree to abide by certain rules and accept responsibility for certain activities in your accounts. Make sure you read the disclosures before opening an account with the bank. Pay special attention to any fees, and make sure you know how often you can make withdrawals and deposits.

Note

If you’re under 18 years old, you’ll need someone over age 18 to open the account with you. You still might be able to use a debit card and online banking, and you can eventually get your own account.

Print, Sign, and Mail (If Required)

If you're opening a bank account online, you may have to print, sign, and mail a document to the bank before the account is opened. Some banks use electronic disclosure and consent to make the banking relationship legally binding—you can do everything online.6

Others still require a signed document to open an account.7 Until the bank receives the documents, your account is not active.

Fund Your Account

If you’re opening a checking or savings account, you’ll often need to make an initial deposit into the account. Sometimes, this is required as part of the opening process, and other times, you can do it after the account is up and running. There are several ways to fund your account:

Deposit cash: It should be available for you to spend within one business day.8
Deposit a check or money order: The funds should be available within a few business days after you make the deposit, but it may take longer because it's a new account.9
Set up direct deposit with your employer: If your company offers this, instead of getting a physical paycheck, your earnings will be sent directly to your new account.
Transfer funds electronically: You can move money from another bank account to make your initial deposit.
Start Using the Account

If you followed all the steps, you should have a brand new bank account in your name. It should be ready to use within a few minutes to a few days. For checking and savings accounts, keep an eye out for a debit card or ATM card in the mail.

You might also get a checkbook or be able to order one. To make the most of your account, you may be able to sign up for account features that help you manage your money, including:


Online bill pay: This feature allows you to pay bills electronically.
Remote check deposit: Your bank’s mobile app may allow you to deposit checks remotely so that you don’t have to make trips to a branch or fill out deposit slips.
Alerts: Sign up for text or email alerts so you know when your account balance is running low or when large withdrawals happen.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What do I need to open a bank account?

When you open a new bank account, you'll need to provide identification so that the bank can verify your identity. You'll want to bring a government-issued ID, like a driver's license, passport, or military ID. If you don't have a government-issued ID, you should ask your bank what other forms of identification it can accept. You'll need to provide your identification number, which might be a Social Security number, alien identification number, or other government-issued ID number. Finally, you'll need proof of your physical and mailing address, as well as an initial deposit, if required.

How much money do you need to open a bank account?

Every bank has its own requirements for opening account balances. Most banks will require an initial deposit that ranges from $25 to $100. However, you can also find a few banks that will allow you to open an account without any money down. Be sure to ask the bank how much money you need to deposit to open an account and what the minimum balance is to avoid fees. Make sure any bank you put your money in is FDIC-insured.101

How long does it take to open a bank account?

The application process for a new bank account is fairly quick. You can usually apply online in 15 minutes or less, though it may take a bit longer in person. It may also take a few days for the bank to verify your information and allow you to begin using your account.

You probably know that a savings account is an excellent place to keep money safe, but you don't have to stick to one account. Opening multiple savings accounts can help with budgeting and organizing your finances. You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or loss of your job.

You can also have a savings account for each goal, such as saving up for a family trip or buying a home. Depending on your bank, there's likely no limit to how many savings accounts you can open, but it can be challenging to keep track of them after a certain point.

Learn the benefits of multiple savings accounts, how many you can have, and how you can use them to organize your finances.

Key Takeaways
Don't limit yourself to one savings account since multiple accounts can help with budgeting, organizing your finances, and saving for your financial goals.
You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or loss of your job.
Setting up multiple savings accounts is easy if your bank allows it. You can also have accounts at multiple institutions.
A strategy helps you define your goals and how you will reach them, keeping you on track.
Why Use Multiple Savings Accounts?

There are several benefits to having more than one savings account.

It Sets Money Aside

Setting up different savings accounts for specific financial goals helps you save for those goals. You begin by moving money out of your primary checking or savings account to a new savings account. Doing this removes it from easy access and helps you resist the temptation to spend the money you've earmarked for something else.

It Automates Your Savings

You can automate monthly transfers to multiple savings accounts if you have a steady income. That way, you never forget to save for your goals, and you get money in the right place quickly.

Many banks have automatic transfer features that come standard with your account. If yours doesn't, you might be able to transfer funds to another bank, but check to see if the bank will charge you for it.

Note

Automatic transfers keep you from forgetting to save. However, make sure you deduct the money you have scheduled for transfer from your budget, so you don't forget it will be transferred and spend it.

It Protects You From Yourself

After you move money into a savings account earmarked for a particular goal, you may experience some guilt if you raid that account for luxury items or unnecessary expenses. This behavioral trick can help you stay on track.

You Can Monitor Your Progress

Multiple savings accounts let you track your progress toward your goals. When everything is mixed together, it’s less clear where you stand because your money is all in one place. You can even label each savings account with the goal you have to help you track your financial plan.

You Can Build Momentum

Success is motivating. If you see an account growing, you have positive reinforcement to continue your saving behavior. Working toward your goals is more enjoyable, and you’re more likely to keep it up.

You Hold Yourself Accountable

Using multiple savings accounts lets you quickly see why you're not meeting your financial goals. In other words, your account balance doesn’t lie. If you decide to save money for something but don’t follow through, it’s important to figure out what’s happening.

Note

If you're not meeting your savings goals, you'll need to make sure you're tracking all of your expenses and spending. Then, make sure your goals are realistic; look at the timeline you've set for yourself and make sure you can save the amount you want with the expenses, budget, and time you have.

You Smooth Your Spending

A dedicated savings account can help you budget for significant annual expenses. For example, if you pay property taxes and homeowners insurance annually instead of using an escrow account, you might want to add to a savings account every month to build up the funds you need. By spreading out the burden of annual costs, you can avoid spending shocks throughout the year.


Your Savings Is Insured

If you’re fortunate enough to have significant cash savings, you might open savings accounts at different banks to keep your account balances below FDIC insurance limits. The $250,000 limit is typically per account per institution, so keeping excess amounts at a different institution helps you stay safe (ensure the bank is under separate coverage).1 That said, having more than $250,000 in one bank may be possible—ask your bank for details.

Using Multiple Savings Accounts

There is a little more to it than just setting up multiple savings accounts and putting money into them. Creating a strategy can help you get your savings organized and help money flow to the correct accounts.

Note

If you’ve merged your finances with a spouse or partner, it may make sense to open several savings accounts. You can place money in separate accounts for spending on hobbies or yourselves. You could also create another account for joint goals and expenses. Discuss how you want to handle finances, and design a system that feels right for everybody.

Identify What You're Saving For

The first step is to identify what you're saving for. Find out how much your goals will cost, then figure out if you'll be able to save that much realistically. For example, if you wanted to take your family to Disneyland, you'd pick the length of your vacation, how many days it takes to travel, and all the costs involved in getting there.

A three-day Park Hopper ticket costs $390 per adult and $370 per child. If you have a spouse and two children, you'd need $1,520 plus travel, lodging, and meals.2

Let's say that four nights in a hotel costs $1,000, and $800 for 12 meals. Also, it cost $1,000 for round-trip flights and $150 for a car rental. As a result, it's possible that you'll need $4,470 plus 10% for extra expenses. So if you can only save $100 per month for this trip, it would take nearly 45 months to save the $4,470 you need.

If you have multiple goals, you'll need to compensate for those by playing with the numbers and timeline to make sure you can save enough and meet your monthly expenses at the same time.

Find Out What Your Bank Offers

Second, you should find out if your bank lets you open multiple savings accounts. Look for monthly fees, required minimums, transfer fees, transfer limits, or any other factors that might cost you extra if you use multiple accounts.

If your bank doesn't have what you need, look for another bank. Online banks can also have what you need; in fact, they might offer the easiest approach to using more than one savings account. For example, Ally Bank allows you to open up to 10 sub-savings accounts as part of your primary account.3 Online banks also offer sub-accounts, which have several benefits:

No monthly fees, in most cases, which can wipe out any interest you earn or take from your savings
No account minimums, allowing you to start small
Competitive interest rates, helping you grow your savings
Automate as Much as Possible

Third, once you've identified your goals and figured out how much you can save, consider the automatic transfers mentioned previously. This is important when implementing your strategy because it makes sure you're paying yourself.

Life happens, you may get busy, and moving funds to a different savings account might not be at the top of your priority list. To ensure you keep saving, link your primary checking account to your savings accounts and schedule automatic transfers for each pay period.

Note

It can also help to create a plan to stop all of your automated transfers in case a life event changes your situation. You can keep a list of all of your automated transfers or create a checklist you can follow to make sure you keep your finances organized if a stressful event occurs.

Refine Your Strategy

A good rule of thumb when planning and implementing a financial strategy is that it's best to look over your plan every two or three months or anytime you experience a change that might affect your finances. Many people experience events that can change how they save, how much they save, or what they are saving for. With that in mind, you might have to adjust your payments over time, but that's okay as long as you keep working at it.

To help you address any life events, you can prioritize your goals. That way, if something happens, you can reallocate money to fund your high-priority goal; you'd ""borrow"" from your lower-priority accounts. Diverting funds from your other accounts isn't ideal, but reality occasionally forces your hand—being able to take it in stride by having a plan, making adjustments, and keeping it going is what will get you to your financial goals.

Frequently Asked Questions
How many savings accounts should I have for budgeting?

You should have enough savings accounts to organize your finances. You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses. Also, you could have an account for each goal, such as saving up for a family trip or a downpayment to buy a home.

How many savings accounts can you have?

The number of savings accounts you're limited to depends on your bank. Some might not have a limit, while others might only let you have one. If you need more than one, talk to your bank or shop for a bank that lets you have multiple savings accounts.

Should I keep all of my money in one bank?

The money you have in your bank account is ensured up to $250,000 per institution by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). You can keep more than this in a bank account at one bank if the bank allows it, but the entire amount won't be federally insured. Check with your bank to see how much you can keep in your accounts.

How much does the average person have in their savings account?

According to the Survey of Consumer Finances done in 2019 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, it depends on the consumer's age. Those 65-74 years old average about $61,000, 55-64 about $58,000, 45-54 have around $48,000. Ages 35-44 have about $28,000, and those less than age 35 have about $11,000 saved.4

A savings account is an account you open through a bank or credit union, in which you can deposit funds and accrue interest over time. Savings accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 per account, providing a safe place to store money while helping you save for financial goals.

When opening a new savings account, there are many things to consider. Learn about the different types of savings accounts, how to find the best rates, and what to watch out for. Knowing how to choose the best savings account for you can help you make the most of your savings potential.

Key Takeaways
A savings account is a safe place to store your money while earning interest.
High-yield savings accounts help your money grow faster.
Some savings accounts have minimum balance requirements and costly fees.
Online accounts tend to offer higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar bank accounts.
Interest Rates

Choosing the best savings account starts with comparing interest rates. You can look up and compare interest rates by visiting the websites of several banks or credit unions. When comparing savings accounts, you may notice two rates: the simple interest rate and the APY. Simple interest is the money you earn based on your deposits and does not include compounding. APY is the total interest you earn in one year, including compounding interest.

Note

Compounding interest means you earn interest on the money you save and the interest that money earns.

Traditional savings accounts at a brick-and-mortar bank pay lower interest rates than other types of accounts, such as a certificate of deposit (CD).1 Online banks tend to offer high-yield savings accounts with interest rates above the national average. Depending on the bank and type of account, interest may compound daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. The more frequently the interest compounds, the faster your money will grow.2

For example, putting $10,000 in a savings account with 0.08% APY that compounds monthly will earn you $8 after one year, totaling $10,008. However, that same $10,000 in a high-yield account with 1.00% APY will earn you $100—$10,100—after 12 months of compounding.3

How To Calculate Your Yearly Earnings

Many savings accounts use compound interest. To calculate how much money you can earn in one year on an account with $1,000 that compounds monthly at a 1% interest rate, you would use the following formula with the following variables:


A = P x (1 + r/n)nt

A = the total earning you are trying to determine
P = your opening deposit ($1,000)
r = your interest rate converted to decimal format (divide 1 by 100 = 0.01)
n = the number of months it would compound (12 months = 12 times a year)
t = your total interest earned in one year

Plug the numbers into the formula:

A = 1,000 x (1 + 0.01/12)(12x1)

Next, use a calculator or pencil and paper to get the total of $1,010.05. So your earnings would be $10.05 in one year if you did not withdraw or add any additional money.4

Account Minimums, Fees, and Other Costs

To open a standard savings account, most banks and credit unions require an initial deposit ranging from $5 to $100.3 However, it’s also important to be aware of any additional costs or fees you may encounter. For example, many savings accounts may have minimum balance requirements that trigger a fee anytime your balance drops below that number. Fees can be more than just an inconvenience; they can diminish your interest-earning potential and reduce the amount of money you save.

Other common fees to look out for include:

Monthly account maintenance fee: These can range from $5 to $25 per month.5
Excess withdrawal fee: Banks can charge from $3 to $25 per transaction for too many withdrawals—typically if you make more than six in one month.56
Inactivity fee: Some banks charge a fee if your account still has a balance but remains dormant for 12 months.
Returned item fee: A bank may charge a fee if you deposit a check into your account that gets returned for insufficient funds.
Note

On April 24, 2020, the Federal Reserve suspended the six-withdrawal limit on savings accounts mandated by Regulation D. Therefore, banks are no longer required to charge beyond six withdrawals. However, they still have the option to do so.7

Types of Savings Accounts

Choosing the savings account that will work best for you depends on your financial goals. Aside from a traditional savings account, here are some of your options.

Cash Savings Account

Cash savings accounts function similarly to high-yield savings accounts. However, these accounts are generally offered through a nonbank financial institution and are FDIC-insured, sometimes up to $1 million.8 If you prefer the freedom to make unlimited withdrawals without having to pay fees, while still gaining interest, a cash savings account may be a good alternative.

Money Market Account

A money market account (MMA) is a high-yield savings account that may come with check-writing privileges or a debit card, similar to a checking account. It often requires a higher minimum balance and typically limits the number of transactions per month. Because it earns a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account, this may be an ideal account if you want your money to grow while still maintaining its liquidity.

Retirement Account

A retirement account is an investment vehicle that allows you to contribute money that will grow into financial security for your retirement. Choosing the best one may depend on the age you start, when you plan to retire, and how aggressively you wish to save. Retirement accounts offer tax advantages, they earn interest, and the sooner you start, the more your money can significantly compound over time.

Speaking with a financial advisor may help you determine which option is right for your specific retirement goals. However, most people find that having a combination of accounts is what best meets their needs. Here’s a look at the many options available:9

Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)
Roth IRAs
401(k) plans
SIMPLE 401(k) plans
403(b) plans
SIMPLE IRA plans (Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees)
SEP plans (Simplified Employee Pension)
SARSEP plans (Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension)
Payroll deduction IRAs
Profit-sharing plans
Defined benefit plans
Money purchase plans
Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
Governmental plans
457 plans
CDs

A CD, or certificate of deposit, is a savings account that allows you to lock money away at a guaranteed interest rate for a fixed amount of time. Standard CDs can range from six months to five years.10 Your money earns a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account. However, you cannot withdraw money before the end of the term without paying a penalty. CDs may work well if you want to earn a higher interest rate on a larger sum of cash that you won’t need access to anytime soon.

Opening a New Account With a Familiar Institution

Keeping multiple accounts at the same bank or credit union can make managing your finances simpler. Here’s how:

You only need to log into one bank to access your account.
You can transfer funds easier and faster between accounts.
You’ll have a convenient snapshot of all your accounts in one place.
You can build a great relationship with the financial institution.

Your bank or credit union wants to keep your business, so it may offer additional perks for opening new accounts, such as lower fees and better interest rates. Still, you should always shop around and compare the services of other financial institutions to learn your options before making a final decision.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the best reason to have a savings account in addition to a checking account?

The best reason for having both a checking and a savings account is because each serves a different purpose. Your checking account acts as the workhorse for your finances by allowing you to manage your day-to-day expenses while typically earning little or no interest.  Meanwhile, your savings account will enable you to earn interest and watch your money grow as you save for financial goals.

What is the best interest rate you can get on a savings account?

Interest rates change quickly. When you’re ready to open a new savings account, here are some tips to help you find the best rate:

Research online to find the top savings account interest rates available.
Compare different banks; typically, online banks have higher rates than brick-and-mortar.
Read the fine print for requirements such as minimum balances or additional fees.
Avoid temporary teaser rates that may expire within a few months.

Savings accounts are low-risk places to keep cash you're putting away for a rainy day or a financial milestone. Since savings accounts are interest-bearing, your balance grows at a faster rate compared to a checking account or cash stashed underneath a mattress.

Opening a basic savings account is a simple process—you can open a new account in just a few minutes—but knowing when to open one isn't always obvious. If you are wondering if there’s a “best” time to open a savings account, here are a few things to consider.

Key Takeaways
Having at least one savings account is essential for adults to meet financial goals or separate money that's otherwise off-limits.
Rising interest rates are a good opportunity to open a savings account with a higher interest rate.
Parents may open a savings account for minor children anytime the child starts accumulating money.
Opening a savings account to take advantage of a promo offer is a solid move when you can meet the requirements.
When To Open a Savings Account

Because of the safety and security they provide, a savings account is an important consideration to help you meet your financial goals. There are also a number of other specific reasons to open one.

If You Don't Have One

If you don't have a savings account at all (and you're over age 18), the best time to open one is now. Having a savings account makes a portion of your money less available to you, which makes it easier to accumulate and reach your short- and long-term financial goals.

When There Are Rising Interest Rates

When interest rates are going up, opening a high-yield savings account allows you to snag better returns on your deposits.1 If you already have such an account, it won't hurt to shop around for even higher yields. When interest rates go up, it's common for banks to continually offer increased interest rates to entice customers.

When There Is Market Volatility

A high-yield savings account is an attractive alternative for earning interest when stock market volatility puts investing outside your risk tolerance. You can continue earning a decent return on your savings and put the money into equity investments once you feel comfortable about the market.2

For a Minor Child

Parents should consider opening a savings account for their child once they have saved up some money on their own. Receiving a large cash gift is another opportunity to open a child's first savings account. Teaching children to establish good money habits early on can set them up for financial success later in life.

Promotional Offers for New Savings Accounts

Promotional offers from banks that reward new customers for opening an account and making a deposit carry additional incentives for opening an account. For instance, a promotion may offer a $200 bonus if you deposit $20,000 within 20 days of opening your account.

Read the fine print to learn about any exclusions, things that could keep you from earning the bonus, or fees associated with the account. Some offers are only available with a specific promo code or when you apply from a third-party affiliate link. In addition, current bank customers may not be eligible for cash promotions. Even if you meet the initial requirements, you can lose eligibility if you close the account too soon or don't maintain the minimum required balance.

Note

To protect your personal information, only follow promotional links from reputable websites.

When To Open Multiple Savings Accounts

Having more than one savings account allows you to take advantage of the benefits offered by each. As your cash grows, maintaining savings accounts at different banks ensures all your deposits have adequate deposit insurance coverage.3 There are a few types of savings accounts to consider.

Traditional Savings Account

A traditional savings account offered by a brick-and-mortar bank gives you access to a network of ATMs and physical bank branches where you can access your money without paying additional fees.

Open a traditional savings account when you need the benefit of in-person customer service, need to make frequent cash deposits, or if you’re not comfortable banking online.4

Online Savings Account

An online savings account is offered by a bank that operates strictly online, which means visiting a bank branch isn't an option. Because their operating costs are lower, online banks tend to offer higher APYs on savings accounts, allowing you to earn more interest on your deposits.4

Open an online savings account when you want to earn more interest on your balance and have the flexibility to do most of your banking electronically.

Money Market Account

A money market account combines the high-yield benefits of an online savings account with the accessibility of a checking account. Certain transactions don't count against most banks’ six-transaction limit, which gives you more penalty-free access to your funds.5

Open a money market account when you have a significant amount of money in a checking account and interest rates are high or increasing.

Note

Deposits in a money market account are insured at FDIC- and NCUA-insured banks and credit unions. Money market mutual funds, however, do not have deposit insurance.6

If you have more than $250,000 deposited at a single bank, even in multiple accounts, make sure all your balances qualify for federally-guaranteed deposit coverage.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do you open a savings account?

You can open a savings account online or in person by choosing a bank, completing an application, providing proof of your identity, and making the minimum deposit, if one is required.

How old do you have to be to open a savings account?

In most states, you need to be 18 or older to open a bank account on your own. Otherwise, the account must be designated as a minor or youth savings account (even for a baby), and have a parent or legal guardian named as a joint account owner or custodian.7

Long-term savings accounts can be used to save for large purchases, college expenses, retirement, and more. You can use long-term savings to pay for one-time expenses or help manage your day-to-day living costs once you're no longer working.

Comparing different long-term savings account options, their interest rates, potential returns, fees, and more can help you decide where to keep your money. Not all savings accounts will meet your needs and goals, so consider the various types before signing up.

Key Takeaways
Long-term savings accounts are used to hold the money you don't expect to use any time soon.
You might use a long-term savings account if you have a financial goal like saving for your child's college tuition.
There are several types of long-term savings accounts, such as high-yield accounts, IRAs, or certificates of deposit.
What Is a Long-Term Savings Account?

Long-term savings accounts are designed to hold the money you don't expect to need to spend in the near future. They're different from short-term savings or checking accounts that you might use to set aside money for bills, an upcoming vacation, wedding, or other one-time expenses. You can have a long-term savings account at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. Some may charge monthly account fees, have withdrawal limits or penalties, and other rules to follow.

Long-term savings accounts are generally suited for goals that are several months or years away and help you take advantage of compounding interest. The longer you have to save and let interest compound, the more your money can grow.

Note

Before you start building your long-term savings, it's essential to make sure you have short-term cash available in an emergency fund first. Financial experts recommend keeping three to six months' worth of expenses in emergency savings.1

These accounts can be used to further specific financial goals. For example, you may open a long-term savings account to get a head start on college planning while your kids are young. Or you may want to build long-term cash savings in a retirement account as part of a strategy to retire early.

Who Needs a Long-Term Savings Account?

Having a long-term savings account can benefit virtually anyone who wants to make the most of the money they don't plan to spend soon. For example, say you want to buy a home in the future. Opening a savings account with a high interest rate can help you fund a down payment while earning interest until you're ready to make your purchase.

Long-term savings can also pay off when you're ready to retire. You can diversify your income sources with different types of long-term savings accounts. And certain types of accounts can offer tax advantages when you're adding money to them—or when you need to withdraw it later.

Types of Long-Term Savings Accounts

Long-term savings accounts aren't all alike, so it helps to know how they compare. Looking at the interest you could earn, fees you might pay, and whether there are any applicable tax or withdrawal rules can help you decide which long-term savings accounts are right for you.

Note

Interest rates for savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CD) are influenced by the federal funds rate. If the Federal Reserve raises or lowers this rate, banks may make similar adjustments to interest rates for deposit accounts.2

High-Yield Savings Accounts

High-yield savings accounts offer interest rates and annual percentage yields (APYs) above what you may get with a traditional savings account. Brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions can offer high-yield accounts, but online banks often pay better rates to savers.

That's because online banks tend to have lower overhead costs, which allows them to pass on higher rates to their customers. High-yield savings accounts from online banks can also charge fewer fees, allowing you to keep more of the interest you earn. Nevertheless, before moving money to any new savings account, check to make sure it's FDIC-insured first.

Certificates of Deposit

CDs are time accounts. The money you add to this type of long-term savings account earns interest over a specified period. Once the CD matures, you receive your initial deposit along with the interest earned.

Some CDs can have shorter terms, ranging from 30 to 90 days. However, some have terms as long as 10 years. Generally, the longer the CD term, the higher your interest rate and APY are likely to be (but not always). Make sure you compare CD rates before choosing one.3

Note

CD accounts often have early withdrawal penalties. Many banks or credit unions charge a percentage of the interest earned when you withdraw money from your CD ahead of the maturity date. If you choose to use a CD for your savings, make sure you have emergency funds elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll have to pay early withdrawal fees if you take the money from your CD.

Individual Retirement Accounts

Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. With a traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct your contributions on your taxes each year. With a Roth IRA, you don't get a tax deduction for contributions, but qualified withdrawals are 100% tax-free.

Unlike a CD or a regular savings account, money saved in an IRA can be invested in mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or other investment types. While IRAs carry more risks than CDs, there's also a much greater potential for your money to grow if your chosen funds perform well.

Note

Withdrawing from an IRA before age 59 1/2 can trigger a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Depending on which type of IRA you're taking money from, you may have to pay income tax on the withdrawal. Learn the difference between a traditional IRA and Roth IRA before deciding on one.4

Employer-Sponsored Retirement Accounts

An employer-sponsored retirement plan—like a 401(k) or a 403(b)—is another long-term savings account with tax advantages. Contributions are tax-deductible, and the annual contribution limit is much higher than IRAs.

The potential employer matching contributions give 401(k) plans an edge over IRAs. If your employer matches a percentage of your contributions, you're essentially getting free money to help fund your long-term retirement savings goals. You may also be able to take a hardship distribution or loan from your 401(k) if needed.

Note

If you take out a 401(k) loan and leave your job before it's been repaid, your employer can ask for the entire balance in full. If you can't pay it back, the loan is treated as a taxable distribution.5

Education Savings Accounts

A 529 savings account allows you to contribute money on behalf of a qualified beneficiary, including your child, grandchild, or even yourself. Those contributions grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses.

A Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) works along the same lines, but the difference is that a Coverdell ESA caps your annual contributions at $2,000, and no new contributions can be made after the beneficiary's 18th birthday. Additionally, all money must be withdrawn from the account by the beneficiary's 30th birthday; otherwise, a tax penalty applies.6

How To Use Long-Term Savings Accounts Wisely

If you're using a long-term savings account to plan ahead, there are a few tips to keep in mind to get the most out of your efforts:

Compare interest rates: Analyze multiple savings accounts and CDs so you can shop around carefully and get the best rate possible.
Pay attention to CD maturity dates: The penalty for early withdrawals can easily wipe out any interest you've earned.
Remember that rates can fluctuate: Savings and CD rates can increase or decrease over time. Diversifying across different savings accounts can offer some insulation against rate changes.
Choose accounts that fit your time frame: Ideally, you want to have as long a runway as possible to benefit from compounding interest.
Check account fees: While you may be earning good returns from your investments or interest rate, hidden fees could nibble away at those earnings.
Don't drain retirement accounts prematurely: In doing so, you could not only end up with a large tax bill, but you may also shrink your nest egg.
The Bottom Line

Long-term savings accounts let you save money and accumulate compounded interest that you may not need for several years or even decades. Some of these accounts, such as an IRA or a 401(k), can also offer tax advantages when you make contributions or withdrawals.

Before you start building long-term savings, make sure you have a short-term emergency savings fund in place. Then compare different long-term savings options, rates, fees, and penalties so you can find the best rate of return for your money.

Budgeting is a crucial step toward a healthy financial life. It allows you to look at your monthly income and create a clear action plan of what you will do with your money before you spend it. Whether you’re planning to pay down debt, save for retirement, or tame your spending on groceries every month, budgeting can help you achieve your financial goals faster.

Key Takeaways
Budgeting gives you control over where your money is going.
Choosing the right budgeting strategy can help you achieve financial goals.
Creating wiggle room makes it easier to stick to your budget.
Prioritizing savings can provide better financial stability.
Know Your Income

All budgeting starts with knowing your monthly after-tax income, also known as your “take-home” pay. Getting a complete picture of where your money comes from will help you create the foundation for setting your spending and savings goals. Begin by identifying how much money you can expect to bring into your household each month.

Income may come from multiple sources, including your regular paycheck, a side hustle, child support, or government benefits. You can calculate total monthly income by listing each source of income, then writing down the minimum amount each one will bring in after taxes.

Note

If you are self-employed, you may have inconsistent income. Consider using your earnings from the lowest income-earning month you’ve had in the last two years as the baseline amount when setting up your monthly budget.

Choose Your Budgeting Strategy

Budgeting can feel like an overwhelming task for some people. But keep in mind that the best budgeting method is the one that works for you. “There are many great ways to budget, but each plays to different skill sets and financial goals. So don't feel like you have to conform to a strict method,” Kari Lorz, a Certified Financial Education Instructor (CFEI) and founder of Money for the Mamas, told The Balance in an email interview.

50/30/20 Budgeting

If you’re looking for a simple budgeting method,  the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy may be worth a try. It works by splitting your monthly income into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

TAKE-HOME PAY	BUDGET CATEGORY	TYPE OF EXPENSE
50%	Needs	Mortgage/rent, food, utilities, transportation
30% 	Wants 	Eating out, shopping, vacations, entertainment
20% 	Savings 	Emergency fund, debt payoff, retirement
Zero-Based Budgeting

If you want to know where every dollar you earn is going, you may like zero-based budgeting. It lets you control your spending by determining where every dollar goes before you spend it.

Note

Zero-based budgeting is not about spending your money until you have nothing left. It means allocating your money toward your expenses and goals so that if you have money left after expenses, you’re intentional about dedicating it to a goal like debt payment or savings.

Categorize your expenses and figure out exactly how much you’re going to spend in each category and on what. You’ll probably want to first allocate funds to food, housing, utilities, transportation, debt repayment, and other essentials.

Next, you might allocate a certain amount to building your emergency fund or contributing to a savings account for a new home. What’s left may go to entertainment, travel, or other fun expenses. At the end of each month, you’ll get a chance to redo your budget and change anything you need to.

Cash Envelope

The cash envelope strategy works well for people who prefer a more concrete, hands-on budgeting system to help get spending under control.

This technique involves labeling envelopes based on your budget categories—for example, groceries, utilities, and transportation. You then separate actual cash into each envelope. Once the money is gone, that’s all you can spend on that item for the month. This method can create an acute awareness of where your money is going, making it much harder to overspend.

Note

There are envelope budgeting apps you can use for electronic funds and credit or debit card payments if you don’t want to use cash to pay for everything.

Give Yourself a Margin

Always trying to keep track of every dime you spend can feel tedious. So setting aside a certain amount of money to be your margin of error every month is a way of creating breathing room in your budget. “A margin is the secret sauce for maintaining a monthly budget and achieving your financial goals,” Damian Dunn, Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and Vice President of Advice with Your Money Line, told The Balance in an email interview.

However, make sure you’re still financially responsible. You can add a little flexibility into your budget, but keep track of your spending so you don’t go over the margin you’ve given yourself.

How To Create a Margin

The key to creating a margin is to identify how much of your income you don’t need to spend each month. That’s your buffer, or margin. “A margin allows us to absorb the unexpected things that pop up every month without needing to resort to credit or raiding the emergency fund. Ideally, I love to see budgets with 5% to 10% of margin,” said Dunn.

Dunn knows your margin is affected by life circumstances, “But once you've got a margin, fight like crazy to keep it.” In other words, don’t let lifestyle creep eat away at that buffer.

Pay Yourself First

When trying to budget a host of expenses, finding money to save sometimes seems impossible. Try budgeting for your savings before anything else and paying your bills with what’s left after you’ve planned for your savings. This is often called “paying yourself first.”

To do this, set up automated savings contributions so you can save money before you start spending your paycheck.

“Automated savings contributions help create an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach. I would argue that it’s difficult to ever get ahead when you don’t make your savings a priority in your life,” Lorrie Delk Walker, a financial advisor with Allen & Company in Lakeland, Florida, told The Balance in an email.

Use a Budgeting App

When you need extra help staying on top of your spending, a budgeting app can help you track your money right from the palm of your hand. The right app for you is one whose features and costs best suit your financial needs. A few popular choices include:

Mint by Intuit: This is a free tool that links all your accounts, categorizes your transactions automatically, helps you set up budgets, and tracks your spending.
You Need a Budget (YNAB): This app uses the zero-based budgeting system. You can also link your accounts, manage spending, pay down debt, and save. It is a paid service that offers a free trial.
Pocket Guard: Helps you optimize spending, link your accounts, and save automatically. The basic version is free.
Track Your Progress

At its core, budgeting is simply a spending plan. Keep track of your spending to see what’s working, where you’re struggling, and where your money is going. In the beginning, it may help to track your spending on a daily or weekly basis, and assess your budgeting method every month or so. Once you’ve settled on a method you think works, you can make assessments after longer intervals.

“Tracking progress and making adjustments is critical,” Jeff Grampp, CFF and director at Gateway Investor Relations, told The Balance in an email interview. “The costs of things change over time, as do consumption habits. So every year or so, take time to reassess where you're at and gauge the accuracy of your budget.""


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is budgeting?

Budgeting is the process of making a consistent and intentional plan for your money. Make sure your budget works for you. If you feel limited by your budget, it may be time to change it. Make sure your budget includes some fun goals or splurges. That way, you’re more likely to stick with it.

Why is budgeting important?

Budgeting is important because it makes sure you have enough money to cover your expenses and that you’re intentional about what you do with the rest of your money. It helps you pay close attention to your spending, savings, and general financial health. When you create a plan and set goals, it’s easier for you to control your finances and make informed decisions about your spending. It’s also easier for you to identify financial risks and opportunities.

What are some common budgeting mistakes?

Sticking to a budget can be tricky, and  being restrictive doesn’t help. If your  budget doesn’t have any margin for error or you’re too hard on yourself, you might get so frustrated that you give up on your budget. You should also make sure to track your spending, set money aside for an emergency fund, and review your budget regularly to make sure it’s up-to-date.

DAMIRCUDIC/GETTY IMAGES

The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in June 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1 Although that statistic represents a decline from spring 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, it still means millions of Americans are out of work.

If you’re one of those millions, you may be dealing with shock, grief, and anger, along with stress and anxiety, especially if you lost your job unexpectedly. However, we’ve got some tips to guide you through the next steps after a sudden job loss.

Get Your Finances in Order

Although there are emotional effects from losing your job, it’s the financial ramifications that can cause the most distress. In fact, unforeseen loss of income can deal a significant blow to your emotional health, so you’ll feel better if you can get your finances in order as soon as possible. Here are five important steps to take.

File for Unemployment

Filing for unemployment should be done as soon as possible. “It's even more critical to file for unemployment immediately during the pandemic, even if you're unsure if you'd typically qualify,” financial attorney Leslie Tayne, founder and head attorney at Tayne Law Group, a debt solutions law firm, told The Balance by email. 

“In March, the CARES Act was signed into law, which expanded the states' ability to provide unemployment and expanded the requirements,” Tayne said.

So even if you are an independent contractor, freelancer, self-employed, or a part-time worker, you qualify for assistance. However, Tayne noted that the federal aid of $600 per week from the CARES Act has since expired, and you will only receive support from the state moving forward, unless Congress passes another round of support.

To file for unemployment, contact your state’s unemployment office. Fortunately, most claims can be filed and processed online. “To keep the claim moving as quickly as possible, you'll also want to proactively gather important verification information like addresses and dates of your employment so you can provide them right away,” Tayne said.

Review Health Insurance Options

You also need to determine whether, and for how long, your former employer will continue to pay for your health insurance. “Inquire with your manager or HR representative in your company to confirm, as this can be different depending on the company, policy, etcetera,” Tayne said.

Important

Start working on alternatives for coverage immediately to avoid a lapse in insurance, which could result in expensive medical bills.

Where should you look for alternatives to your company’s insurance? According to Tayne, COBRA, Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace plans, or Medicaid are three options. “COBRA will be offered to extend your current health care benefits, but is generally more costly since you no longer receive any assistance [with premium payments] from your employer,” Tayne said.

On the other hand, Tayne said that the ACA Marketplace is likely to be a less-expensive option because premiums are based on income and household size. Or perhaps you can join your spouse’s employer-provided health plan. “Sometimes, you'll even qualify for free or lost-cost coverage through Medicaid as well,” Tayne added. Contact your state Medicaid agency for questions about eligibility.

Move Your Retirement Funds

When you lose your job, you’ll generally choose one of three options for handling your retirement fund.2 “If you plan on returning to work as soon as possible, you may consider leaving your retirement funds as they are and then rolling them into your new company's fund once eligible,” Tayne said. “While you won't contribute anything during this time, you can retain your funds thus far.”

However, you will need to check your employer’s rules regarding your own retirement account to be sure about what you can do without incurring any penalties.

The second option is to roll your account over into your own individual retirement account (IRA) while you decide what you want to do longer term. “This allows you to continue pursuing tax-deferred or tax-free financial growth and potentially have more substantial control over your assets and investment options,” Tayne said. 

The third option is to cash out of your retirement fund. However, Tayne advised thinking long and hard before making this choice: “If you cash out your retirement fund early, you will then be taxed on the entirety of the current amount.” If under age 55, you may also face a 10% early distribution tax penalty.2 “This can satisfy an immediate need for cash but impedes your funds' long-term growth and [leads to] tax loss,” Tayne said.

Tip

If you withdraw some or all of your retirement savings balance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows you to decide within 60 days of receiving the money whether to roll it over to a new employer’s plan or to an IRA.

Cut Expenses

The degree to which you cut your expenses could determine how long your finances will last while you’re between jobs, so leave no stone unturned.  Andrea Woroch, a California-based family finance and budgeting expert, recommends negotiating and reducing your bills and using free services. “Call your service providers and ask how they can help lower your bill without changing your services,” Woroch told The Balance.

Woroch recommends switching to a lower-allowance data plan to save on your mobile phone plan because you can use your home internet for free (hopefully).

“Raise your car insurance deductible since you’re not driving as much and [are] less likely to get into an accident,” Woroch said. “You can also get free video streaming service through your mobile providers; for example, Sprint is offering a free subscription to Hulu and Verizon offers six months of Disney+ for free. Or you can stream digital content from your local library’s website for no charge.”

If you’re a renter, try to negotiate with your landlord for a reduced amount for a few months. Also, “if your rent or mortgage is high and you don’t have a roommate, consider getting one, or move into a smaller house/apartment that’s on the outskirts of town and will be more affordable—and also have lower utility bills,” Woroch said. 

If you’re paying checking account fees, you might want to shop around. “Checking account holders who don't meet minimum balance requirements pay, on average, $15 per month, but there are plenty of free options out there,” Woroch said. “And if you’ve recently been charged overdraft or insufficient-fund fees, call your bank to ask for those to be waived, since many will do so during this [COVID-19] pandemic.”

Tap Your Emergency Fund Sparingly

Your emergency fund should only be accessed as a last resort. “It should be done with extreme caution and as little as possible,” Tayne said.  Before taking this step, contact your creditors to work out deferred or reduced payments for a few months. 

“If you do tap into your emergency fund, it will cover the initial need for cash to cover your necessary expenses, but [you] should still consider having a long-term plan to replace the money you take out, so it isn't depleted,” Tayne said.

Tayne also recommends exploring other local and federal relief programs such as SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, and LIHEAP  (the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program), which are all available for you to seek additional assistance from. “You can also pursue local United Way programs that will give you even further assistance in [financial relief] application and eligibility information,” Tayne added.  

Moving on to Your Job Hunt

Once you’ve taken emergency steps to cover your monthly payments and stabilize your financial life, it’s time to launch your search for a new job. 

You’re competing with a lot of other people who may have also lost their jobs, so you want to stand out. “To impress hiring managers, applicants want to highlight their technical skills and soft skills, such as collaboration, communication, and dedication to excellence,” advised Sheila Murphy, president and CEO of Focus Forward Consulting, which provides career and business development coaching and consulting.

“Applicants should invest time assessing their strengths and weaving those skills into their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and interview responses,” Murphy told The Balance.

Customize Letters and Resumes

Resist the temptation to create form letters and one-size-fits-all resumes. “After researching the company, you need to address how leveraging these skills will benefit the company—do this in your cover letter and interview responses,” Murphy said.

Practice makes perfect, and you’ll want to aim for that to stand out in a crowded field of applicants. “In preparing for interviews, download practice interview questions from the internet, draft answers to those questions, and practice their responses,” Murphy said. She also advised you prepare some questions for the interviewer, to demonstrate you have researched the company and want to be a part of it.

Murphy's views are shared by Michele Mavi, career strategist and founder at MonumentalMe.com, which provides professional development coaching for individuals and teams. “Communication skills are often what makes one candidate stand out over another one with a similar background,” Mavi told The Balance. “To be impressive in an interview, you need to have command of your presentation, and that usually comes with practice.”

Clean Up Your Online Presence

It’s also a good idea to clean up your online presence—and make sure that if you’re active on social media, it's in a constructive way. “The things you post and the comments you make about important topics related to your industry can offer a hiring manager a view of you that goes far beyond what a resume can show,” Mavi said. “The intelligent and insightful commentary you post on platforms such as LinkedIn can create excitement about you as a candidate.”

Note

When creating cover letters, revamping your resume, engaging online, and prepping for the interview, keep in mind what employers are looking for and what can hurt job seekers.

Use Your Networks

Murphy also said that most people find new jobs through their networks, not online postings or recruiters. In addition, she said you’re more likely to receive an interview if a current employee forwards your resume.

Depending on how much is in your emergency fund, you may need some in-between work until you land the right job. “If you need to stay afloat financially, temp work or part-time work is definitely an option to consider,” Mavi said. “You never know who you'll meet in the process, and there is always a chance it could lead to a full-time position.”

Key Takeaways
If you lose your job suddenly, rapidly reducing your expenses is critical to how long your funds will last.
Don’t let your health insurance lapse or you could end up with expensive medical bills.
In a crowded field of job applicants, you can stand out by customizing your responses and practicing your answers.
The right type of social media presence can help you impress employers.
A job loss could eventually lead to a new and better career.

THE BALANCE / GARY FERSTER

Most people have a general idea of how they want to spend their later years. Not many ever stop and figure out how they will financially achieve their desired lifestyle.

There are several considerations for retiring comfortably. At a minimum, you should work to fully fund your retirement account(s), own your home, have no debt, and have emergency funds set aside.

This step-by-step guide empowers you to take control of your retirement plans by building a holistic financial portfolio.

Note

Holistic financial planning is the concept of planning for all of your retirement needs (and unexpected events) rather than applying a traditional catch-all formula.

01
of 11
Start by Taking Stock

When starting your planning, it helps to make a list of everything you own. Include assets such as cars, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, cash, and bank accounts. Next, list everything you owe, such as your student loan or credit card debts.

Don't keep any debts off the list. The key here is to determine exactly where you stand financially. This creates what is known as a ""balance sheet."" It lets you see everything about your finances.

Once you know what you have and owe, you can set realistic goals for balancing them out and getting ahead.

02
of 11
Fund Your 401(k) With Matching Funds

Many businesses match the contributions their employees make to their 401(k) accounts. The amount of these matching contributions can vary widely from company to company.

Matching contributions are free cash. Some people do not take advantage of them, because they don’t understand the time value of money or don’t believe they can afford to have their take-home pay reduced.

However, it pays to maximize your contributions. If your employer were to match you dollar-for-dollar on the first 5% of your contribution, you would immediately be earning a 100% ​return on that 5%.

Note

If your employer doesn’t match your contributions, you won't benefit by putting this step first.

Consider that 401(k)s grow tax-deferred in your 401(k) until you begin taking distributions—usually after age 59 1/2.1 There is a high possibility that if you don't contribute enough for employee matching, it could cost you millions of dollars over the length of a career.

03
of 11
Pay Off High-Interest Credit Card Debt

The next step in building your complete financial portfolio is to develop a plan for paying down high-interest credit card debt. You could use the ""debt-avalanche method"":

Rank your debts by interest rate: From your balance sheet, rank all of your debts by the interest rate you are paying, starting with the highest.
Allocate as much as possible to debt pay-down: Decide how much you can dedicate to debt reduction each month.
Attack the card with the highest interest: Pay the minimum balance on all credit card debt except the highest-ranked one. Pay as much as possible on the highest-ranked card until it has been completely paid off.
Eliminate debts one by one: Cross each card off your list, and put the plastic in a drawer when you finish paying it off. Don't cancel the card; it lowers your credit score and increases the interest rate. Don't charge to it again.
Keep going: Continue this process until all of these accounts are paid in full.

There are other methods for paying off your debts, but the debt-avalanche works well. Remember that you shouldn't abandon your cards altogether—credit cards can be a valuable financial tool when used responsibly.

04
of 11
Fully Fund a Roth IRA

The Roth IRA is one of the best retirement accounts available to investors in the U.S. Most people qualify—in 2021, if your annual income does not exceed $140,000 (if you are single) or $208,000 (if you are married and filing jointly), you can contribute to a Roth IRA.2 These limits increase to $144,000 and $214,00 for 2022.3

Contributions—subject to annual limits—are made with after-tax dollars. Roth IRA contributions can also be withdrawn at any time without any penalty.

Once you reach age 59 1/2, withdrawals of earnings are tax-free as long as your account has been open for five years.4

In other words, if you purchased $10,000 worth of a stock through your qualified Roth IRA and held it for 20 years, you could sell your shares at retirement, and you would owe Uncle Sam nothing—even if that stock grew to be worth millions of dollars.

05
of 11
Purchase a Home

Saving for a down payment on a house is one of the best ways to work toward completing your financial portfolio. While there are expenses generated when owning a home, you're converting what was previously an expense (rent) into equity that you can turn into other loans.

Additionally, the interest paid on your mortgage is tax-deductible, and you're permitted a lifetime capital gains tax exemption of $250,000 (if you're single) or $500,000 (if you're married) if you sell your home at a profit.5

Consider your house to be an investment. For example, if you put 20% down on a $100,000 home, you've spent $20,000. If it appreciates 4% ($4,000) over the next year, it will worth $104,000.

If you had purchased a stock for $20,000 and received $4,000 in value in one year, you would have an investment with a 20% return rate—an excellent return for the money.

06
of 11
Build Your Emergency Reserves

It's essential to establish a six-month emergency cash reserve to cover basic living expenses. A reserve helps you pay for any unexpected home repairs, unemployment, or medical bills. At a minimum, your emergency fund should be sufficient to cover up to six months of the following:

Mortgage payments
Insurance costs
Utility bills

The objective for your emergency cash reserve is safety, not return. The simplest option is to park the funds into savings such as a money market account. If you are interested in generating income, consider building a laddered certificate of deposit (CD) portfolio.

To build a laddered CD portfolio with a reserve of $12,000, you could go to your local bank and open six CDs as follows:

$2,000 30-day (1 month) maturity
$2,000 60-day (2 month) maturity
$2,000 90-day (3 month) maturity
$2,000 120-day (4 month) maturity
$2,000 150-day (5 month) maturity
$2,000 180-day (6 month) maturity

As each CD matures, roll it over into a new six-month CD. In short order, you will own six separate six-month CDs, one of which will mature every month.

Pursue Other Investment Opportunities

A brokerage account allows you to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, real estate investment trusts (REITs), Treasurys, and other investments.

Investing allows you to further diversify your portfolio, allowing you to mitigate the risks of all of the financial plans you've been making. You can also reduce your investing fees by using online discount brokers.

However, in case you're not comfortable with that option, many brokerage firms offer both traditional and online options and allow the client to choose.

Save for Your Children's Education

Here's a secret: You have no obligation to put your child through school. Most parents want the best life for their children; however, consider that education may be more valuable to the recipient if they have something at stake and are required to fund or help with the rising costs of their education.

Note

It is essential that you save for your retirement before putting funds aside for your children’s education. Your kids can find numerous low-interest loan options, scholarships, grants, and federal student aid. If you deplete your retirement fund to help your children, you will have no recourse.

Frequently Asked Questions
How Much Can I Put Into a 401(k)?

Contributions from your salary to a 401(k) are called ""elective deferrals."" In 2021, the limit you can contribute to a 401(k) is $19,500; this increases to $20,500 in 2022. If you are at least age 50, you can make additional annual ""catch-up"" contributions of $6,500 for 2021 and 2022. The maximum amount you can contribute includes employer matching contributions, non-elective employer contributions, elective deferrals, and forfeitures.78

It's vital to ensure that you contribute enough to meet your employer's matching criteria—this maximizes your account's earning potential with money you didn't have to earn.

Roth IRAs and Traditional IRAs have the same annual contribution limits. The maximum amount can change annually, so be sure to check each year for changes.

For 2021 and 2022, the maximum contribution for both types is $6,000 if you're age 49 or younger. If you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions and contribute up to $7,000 per year.9

How Much Should I Save for Retirement?

There are many factors to consider, such as health care, living expenses, and hobbies when retiring.

If you want to maintain the lifestyle you have before retiring, the 80% rule is an excellent guide—you should have enough in your account to annually withdraw 80% of your current salary for the number of years you expect to be retired.

There are other methods, but each one depends upon your goals and circumstances.
