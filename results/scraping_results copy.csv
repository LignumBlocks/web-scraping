In general, air purifiers are helpful for capturing extremely small particles which “can become aerosolized with activities such as fluffing pillows or using the vacuum,” says Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine. “An air purifier can extract these airborne allergens and provides improved overall air quality.” Before you look for the best model for your home, you want to consider factors like the type of filter the device uses, the size of the room in which it will be stationed and, of course, your budget.

This story was written by lifestyle contributor Korin Miller and is overseen by Forbes Vetted’s team of experienced home and kitchen editors.
To ensure we had the best sense of what to look for in an air purifier for pets, we consulted with two medical experts with specialties in allergy and asthma: Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network; and Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine.
We regularly review our selection of the best air purifiers for pets to make sure it is as up to date as possible. This story was last updated in September 2024.

How We Chose The Best Air Purifiers For Pets

To choose the best air purifiers for pets, we focused on the top devices from trusted brands such as Levoit, Bissell, Coway and Honeywell.

We sifted through customer reviews, ensuring each pick had mostly positive feedback (particularly accounting for reviews from pet owners) and an average rating of four stars or more.
We consulted two medical experts with a focus on allergy and immunology to get their input on the most important characteristics to focus on.
Each product was analyzed for features like efficiency, coverage area, design, filtering performance and value. In making the final selections, we kept various lifestyles and budgets in mind.

What To Look For In A Pet Air Purifier

A quality pet air purifier can pull dander and other allergens out of your air, as well as telltale odors that come with pet ownership. When picking out an air purifier for pets, consider these key factors.

Filtration

The goal of an air purifier for pets is to pull pet dander and other allergens out of your home’s air. While many machines can do this, each has its own filtration system and number of filters. HEPA filters are considered the gold standard, given that they can trap very small particles. If pet odors is a big concern, look for a purifier with a charcoal filter—these tamp down on smells by trapping odor-causing particles within the filter. Some purifiers will also have a pre-filter, which is helpful for removing larger items like pet hair from your air.

Fan Speed

Most air purifiers have more than one fan speed, but some have three or more options to flip through. If you tend to deal with intense odors or air quality issues after, say, cooking steak or having a wet dog troop through your home, a turbo fan speed can be helpful to clean your air fast. Many people who sleep with an air purifier running also appreciate having a purifier with a sleep mode, which is typically quiet. Most people toggle through two or so speeds, but some prefer more.

Portability

Air purifiers for pets come in a wide selection of sizes. Petite models are usually simple to transfer between rooms, but larger machines can pose more of a challenge. If you decide to invest in a sizable machine and plan to use it in multiple rooms, look for features like wheels or a handle to make the process of moving it around easier on you. If you’re planning to have a purifier stay in one room, though, portability is less of an issue.

Additional Features

Some air purifiers for pets have extra features to make your air filtration experience even easier. Certain machines come with remotes, allowing you to adjust settings from across the room, and some have apps, so you can make changes from practically anywhere. A turbo boost setting, which allows the purifier to quickly spring into action, is also helpful. If you prefer a more hands-off air purifier experience, consider a machine with sensors to detect the quality of your air and respond accordingly.

UNSPLASH

Once a year, I have the privilege of stepping back to spend time with some of the world’s smartest, most forward-thinking business leaders.

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

debt-free strategy mindset shifts effectiveness,forbes,The Unicorn Strategy: 6 Key Tactics From Fawn Weaver Of Uncle Nearest,Fawn Weaver has built Uncle Nearest into a unicorn worth about $1.1 billion without VC. She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch to sharks.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/dileeprao/2024/09/18/the-unicorn-strategy-6-key-tactics-from-fawn-weaver-of-uncle-nearest/,"Fawn Weaver of Uncle Nearest. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

Since 2017, Fawn Weaver has built Uncle Nearest into a unicorn worth about $1.1 billion, all without relying on venture capital (VC). She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch or plead for funds.

The Background.

Weaver grew up in Los Angeles where, after a few challenges, she and her husband succeeded in real estate. For her 40th birthday, they visited Tennessee where ex-slave Nearest Green had lived and developed the formula for Jack Daniels whisky. Fascinated by his contributions, Weaver decided to honor Green’s achievements by founding her own whisky company. Today, her company, Uncle Nearest, is one of the largest African American-owned spirits brands in the U.S. Here are 6 keys to Weaver’s success.

#1. Find a high-potential opportunity.

Billion-dollar entrepreneurs, from Sam Walton to Travis Kalanick, found their unicorn-opportunity at the intersection of skills and emerging trends. Weaver found hers at the intersection of potential and passion. After reading about Nearest Green, the former slave who developed the Jack Daniels whisky formula, she felt compelled to honor his unsung accomplishment. With the profits from her successful real estate business, she and her husband founded Uncle Nearest in Tennessee’s whisky country near the Jack Daniels distillery.

#2. Develop a unicorn-building strategy.

Considering all the celebrity-based spirits companies that have been sold for huge valuations, including George Clooney’s Casamigos and Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation, it is easy to assume that building a liquor company is easy. However, this assumption is not true. Weaver succeeded by developing a smart, focused strategy:

· Weaver developed an award-winning whisky based on Nearest Green’s charcoal filtration method and won over 1,000 awards to become the “fastest-growing American whisky.”

· Weaver initially focused on Oregon where the state controls alcohol distribution, which gives small distillers like Uncle Nearest better visibility, and reduces the edge typically held by larger spirits companies.

· She followed up her initial market entry by acquiring spirits that were in high demand among African Americans.

· She promoted her liquor company by developing a unique distillery experience that included an amusement park designed to attract tourists and boost direct-to-consumer sales.

#3. Find entrepreneur-smart capital.

To avoid losing control to VCs, Weaver raised capital from 163 investors while ensuring that she and her husband retained 40% ownership of the company and 80% of the voting rights. This allowed her to control her growth and not have to dance to the VC tune. Additionally, she leveraged her equity with bank loans and focused on growth with cash flow and less capital-at-risk – an essential strategy used by more than 90% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs.

#4. Takeoff with a finance-smart strategy – to avoid VC.

Liquor companies typically enjoy high gross margins, in excess of 50%. Weaver capitalized on this by transforming her Shelbyville (TN) location into a tourist destination. This not only attracted a record number of visitors, but also encouraged them to buy premium whisky directly from the company, further boosting margins. This finance-smart approach allowed her to scale without relying on VC.

#5. Keep control.

By avoiding institutional investors and instead raising funds from a large pool of angel investors, Weaver kept control of the venture and the wealth it created.

#6. Get unicorn skills.

Weaver hired distilling experts in Tennessee, including descendants of Nearest Green, to develop her award-winning product. She combined this expertise with the marketing and management skills she honed when building her real estate business in Los Angeles.

MY TAKE: If you aim to build your growth venture while maintaining control and maximizing wealth retained, consider avoiding or delaying VC. Learn from Unicorn-Builders like Fawn Weaver of Uncle Nearest who successfully navigated this path by leveraging strategic funding, retaining control, and applying innovative business strategies (Nothing Ventured Everything Gained).

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

CULT MIA




As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

UNSPLASH

Once a year, I have the privilege of stepping back to spend time with some of the world’s smartest, most forward-thinking business leaders.

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points today (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. For bitcoin, a unique asset often heralded as a hedge against central bank mismanagement, this decision introduces both opportunities and possible near-term risks.

A Signal of Economic Trouble?

The Fed’s decision to cut by 50 bps represents more than just monetary policy adjustment – it’s a clear acknowledgment that the economy is struggling more than policymakers have publicly let on. After a year of aggressive tightening aimed at taming inflation, this shift signals that the central bank is now in damage control mode. It reflects growing anxiety over potential recessionary forces, stagnating job growth, and the underlying structural weaknesses in the financial system.

BitcoinBitcoin -1.8% has traditionally thrived on economic uncertainty, positioning itself as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. However, today’s rate cut presents a more complex reality. While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon – a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s Short-Term Trajectory: Volatility or Opportunity?

For bitcoin, the 50 bps cut sends mixed signals. Historically, rate cuts have been positive for hard assets like bitcoin, as such cuts are inflationary, leading to capital find its way into assets that can serve as stores of value. But this rate cut doesn’t feel like a traditional monetary easing; rather, it’s a borderline emergency response to growing economic instability. If the markets interpret this cut as a sign that the U.S. economy is in deeper trouble than anticipated, bitcoin could be caught in a risk-off selloff.

In recent weeks, bitcoin has struggled to hold onto the gains it made earlier in the summer. After reaching highs of $65,000 in August, its exchange rate with the dollar slipped under $59,000, reflecting broader market uncertainty and concerns about the Fed’s next move. With today’s 50 bps cut, bitcoin could face even more turbulence in the coming weeks as investors reassess the state of the economy.

Deeper Macro Issues: Recession Fears Intensify

Today’s rate cut comes against a backdrop of growing macroeconomic instability. The U.S. labor market, which had been resilient in 2022, is showing signs of strain. Last week’s jobs report revealed troubling data, with the U.S. economy creating fewer jobs than expected and a notable rise in unemployment to 7.1 million. This weakness, coupled with sluggish consumer spending and declining industrial output, paints a picture of an economy that may be slipping into a recession.

Globally, the picture is equally concerning. Europe remains mired in stagnation, with the Eurozone posting lackluster GDP growth of just 0.2% last quarter. In Japan, the central bank faces mounting inflationary pressures while attempting to unwind decades of ultra-loose monetary policy. Meanwhile, China’s economy continues to falter, with a slowdown in factory output, consumption, and rising unemployment threatening its once-robust growth engine.

The Fed’s 50 bps cut, therefore, isn’t just about managing U.S. economic risks; it’s about responding to a global slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for all asset markets. For bitcoin, this means navigating a highly volatile environment where macroeconomic forces exert influence on price movements that is difficult to predict.

Bitcoin’s Role in a Shifting Global Financial Landscape

Despite the short-term volatility that this aggressive rate cut may introduce, the long-term case for bitcoin remains strong. As central banks around the world grapple with economic weakness, their collective response is to increase the supply of money. Whether through rate cuts, quantitative easing, or other forms of liquidity injections, the financial system is increasingly reliant on monetary expansion to maintain even modest growth. In such an environment, bitcoin will continue to be valued as a global financial network independent of any single jurisdiction or central bank policy.

In the long run, this wave of monetary easing will likely reinforce bitcoin’s appeal to those seeking refuge from fiat debasement. However, in the short term, the price of bitcoin may be subject to increased volatility, particularly as the market digests the implications of today’s 50 bps cut.

Short-Term Turbulence, Long-Term Strength

The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of global economic instability. For bitcoin, this could mean a turbulent few months ahead as markets react to the potential for a deeper economic downturn. However, as central banks resort to repeated monetary intervention, bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to strengthen.

In a world where fiat-based economies face ever-growing pressure from mismanagement and politicization, bitcoin continues to offer a compelling alternative. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but those with conviction in bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, sound money system will see today’s rate cut as another step toward validating its long-term value."

Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate today by 0.5%, targeting a range between 4.75% and 5%. An interest rate cut was largely expected across markets, as seen in the CME FedWatch Tool. However, market expectations were divided between a 0.25% and a 0.5% rate cut.

A rate cut of 0.5% is bigger than many market participants had expected, and it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable. Given the relatively solid labor market but elevated consumer inflation, future interest rate cuts are coming, although the Fed still has the license to cut interest rates slowly.

Accompanying the September 18 Fed decision, FOMC forecasts were released in a table with interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appeared in a graphic depiction that economists and investors refer to as the dot plot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

As Prestige Economics expected, the dot plot of median FOMC member forecasts conveyed that Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

The last set of FOMC forecasts was released in June 2024. The FOMC median forecast of interest rates was 5.1% for the end of 2024, 4.1% for the end of 2025, and 3.1% for the end of 2026.

The updated September FOMC median forecast of interest rates was lowered to 4.4% for the end of 2024, lowered to 3.4% for the end of 2025, and lowered to 2.9% for the end of 2026.

Fed member forecasts of future real GDP growth remain relatively positive and inflation is expected to improve more than previously forecast. Unemployment is expected to be weaker than previously forecast.

The median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 unemployment rate was raised to 4.4% from 4%. Meanwhile, the median year-on-year real GDP forecast for Q4 2024 was lowered slightly to 2% from 2.1%.

On the upside, the median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 year-on-year PCE and Core PCE inflation improved, although they are expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target in both Q4 2024 and Q4 2025.

Market Implications

The September Fed rate cut was bigger than some investors had expected, even though the CME FedWatch Tool had reflected the 65% chance of a 0.5% rate cut as of 9:30 a.m. ET on September 18.

A larger-than-expected interest rate cut often presents upside risks to equity and bond prices while weighing on the dollar. Plus, the September interest rate cut is expected by the FOMC to be one of many cuts, which is also supportive of equity and bond prices and bearish for the greenback. This is especially true, given the FOMC forecasts of more interest rate cuts than previously published.

As always, this isn’t the end of the Fed’s story today, and a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks in his 2:30 p.m. ET press conference on September 18, especially about the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts.

The Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in four years Wednesday, one of its most consequential decisions in recent memory, a move likely to be panned by former President Donald Trump and celebrated by Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump, left, and Harris face off at last week's debate.

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES
KEY FACTS

Interest rates can become a hot-button issue around elections, considering lower rates are a much more popular policy as they can boost personal finances with cheaper mortgages and lower interest on student and small business loans.

The notion of independence for the U.S. central bank from other government branches has not stopped politicians from voicing their opinion on what the Fed should do, namely on interest rates.

This summer, Trump suggested the Fed could make a politically motivated decision if it lowers rates before November’s election, telling Bloomberg such a move from the Fed is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing,” though the move from the central bank comes as economic data signals a cut is due, with inflation moderating and unemployment climbing.

Trump promised in July there will be a “lot of cutting” from the Fed should he take office, and, though Harris has not made a similar proclamation, some of her closest associates have called for cuts.

President Joe Biden said in March “I bet” rates were “going to come down” and Sens. John Hickenlooper, Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse called on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to slash interest rates by a drastic 0.75 percentage points in a Monday letter.

Though Harris has stayed mum on the subject, experts suggest the timing of the rate cuts may boost her perception as a member of the incumbent administration; the upcoming rate cut is “an economic tailwind behind the Harris campaign for sure,” Moody’s Analytics economist Mark Zandi told The Washington Post.

TANGENT

Harris and Trump have sparred over the Fed before. Trump made waves in August when he proclaimed the president should have a “say” in Fed decision making, saying he specifically is qualified because he “made a lot of money” and has “better instinct than…people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,” though Trump later walked back the stance by saying the Fed staff doesn't “have to listen” to him.

WHAT DOES THE FEDERAL RESERVE DO?

The U.S.’ central bank’s most important function is arguably determining the federal funds rate, the interest charged for capital reserve transactions between financial institutions, set by a panel of Fed officials known as the Federal Open Market Committee. The federal funds rate is often broadly just referred to as interest rates, considering its outsized influence on most U.S. borrowing from corporate bonds to new car loans. The bank historically runs independently from the rest of the federal government, guided by a “dual mandate” to minimize inflation and maximize employment, meaning its goal is to set the U.S. economy on a long-term path of growth. The Fed typically raises rates when inflation is too high, like it did in 2022 and 2023, and lowers rates when there’s a threat of a serious economic downturn, like it did in early 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Other than conducting its monetary policy objectives, the Fed also regulates commercial banks and controls how much money is in circulation.

WHAT IMPACT DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE ON INTEREST RATES?

Little to none in theory, given the Fed’s pride in independent decision making. However, the president appoints and the Senate confirms the Fed’s seven board of governors, who have permanent seats on the 12-person Federal Open Markets Committee. Biden appointed four of the Fed governors, though Trump tapped Powell to the top central banker job he’s held since 2018.

NEWS PEG

The Fed’s rate-setting committee lowered the federal funds rate Wednesday from 5.25% to 5.5% down to 4.75% to 5%, a 50 basis point reduction that sat on the high end of consensus estimates. The consensus was unusually split on what the Fed would do, with market-implied probabilities of the Fed decision the least settled since Bank of America research began tracking the metric. Derivative trades monitored by CME Group priced in a roughly 60% chance of a 50 basis-point cut announcement Wednesday and 35% odds for a 25 basis-point move (the 75 basis points suggested by Warren did not have much legs). However, the market-implied odds of at least a 0.25 percentage point cut were firmly at 100%, meaning the first rate cut since March 2020 was all but certainty to come Wednesday.

CHIEF CRITICS

Not all Republicans agree with Trump’s opposition to a rate cut Wednesday. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) recently told Politico “the time is right” and “you’ve got to put the greater good ahead of looking political,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told the publication “it is time” for a cut and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) concurred it’s “probably time” for the move and focusing on the data, rather than perhaps controversial timing, is “the way the Fed should operate.”

Project 2025, the controversial political roadmap laid out by Trump allies, though Trump has denied his involvement in the project, calls for a significantly diminished Fed, even laying out a scenario in which the central bank is “effectively abolished” in favor of a far more laissez-faire approach.

CULT MIA

Nina Briance, Founder & CEO of Cult Mia, is transforming the online luxury fashion marketplace by curating exclusive, one-of-a-kind collections from the world’s newest independent designers. As traditional luxury platforms struggle with stagnation and a lack of distinction, Cult Mia shines by focusing on what today’s shoppers truly seek: unique, ethically made fashion that reflects their individuality.

Cult Mia’s rigorous designer selection process ensures that every featured brand meets high standards for quality, exclusivity, and social impact. Out of approximately 275 designers who apply each month, only 10% are accepted. Briance and her team have implemented a sourcing strategy prioritizing ethical, transparent, and responsible practices. “We have a clear baseline for brands joining our platform. Our requirements include responsible production, use of sustainable materials, and a commitment to broader social and environmental impact. Based on their performance in these areas, we rank brands into different sustainability or impact categories, providing them with guidance and support to improve their practices while they are on our platform,” Briance explains.

CULT MIA

Cult Mia offers over 55,000 products from 350 brands spanning 42 countries, with more than 40% of these brands exclusive to the platform. This exclusivity has made Cult Mia the go-to destination for millennial and Gen Z shoppers seeking fashion that reflects their personal identity. According to the company’s surveys, Cult Mia customers are loyal, bold fashion enthusiasts for whom fashion is integral to self-expression. The platform’s items typically range from £250 to £2,500, positioning Cult Mia within the luxury segment, with an average order value of £670.

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

CULT MIA




As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

Our vast library of home and kitchen stories includes extensive coverage on air purifiers, including our main story on the best air purifiers, the best air purifiers for smoke and the best air purifiers for allergies.
This story was written by lifestyle contributor Korin Miller and is overseen by Forbes Vetted’s team of experienced home and kitchen editors.
To ensure we had the best sense of what to look for in an air purifier for pets, we consulted with two medical experts with specialties in allergy and asthma: Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network; and Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine.
We regularly review our selection of the best air purifiers for pets to make sure it is as up to date as possible. This story was last updated in September 2024.

How We Chose The Best Air Purifiers For Pets

To choose the best air purifiers for pets, we focused on the top devices from trusted brands such as Levoit, Bissell, Coway and Honeywell.

We sifted through customer reviews, ensuring each pick had mostly positive feedback (particularly accounting for reviews from pet owners) and an average rating of four stars or more.
We consulted two medical experts with a focus on allergy and immunology to get their input on the most important characteristics to focus on.
Each product was analyzed for features like efficiency, coverage area, design, filtering performance and value. In making the final selections, we kept various lifestyles and budgets in mind.

What To Look For In A Pet Air Purifier

A quality pet air purifier can pull dander and other allergens out of your air, as well as telltale odors that come with pet ownership. When picking out an air purifier for pets, consider these key factors.

Filtration

The goal of an air purifier for pets is to pull pet dander and other allergens out of your home’s air. While many machines can do this, each has its own filtration system and number of filters. HEPA filters are considered the gold standard, given that they can trap very small particles. If pet odors is a big concern, look for a purifier with a charcoal filter—these tamp down on smells by trapping odor-causing particles within the filter. Some purifiers will also have a pre-filter, which is helpful for removing larger items like pet hair from your air.

Fan Speed

Most air purifiers have more than one fan speed, but some have three or more options to flip through. If you tend to deal with intense odors or air quality issues after, say, cooking steak or having a wet dog troop through your home, a turbo fan speed can be helpful to clean your air fast. Many people who sleep with an air purifier running also appreciate having a purifier with a sleep mode, which is typically quiet. Most people toggle through two or so speeds, but some prefer more.

Portability

Air purifiers for pets come in a wide selection of sizes. Petite models are usually simple to transfer between rooms, but larger machines can pose more of a challenge. If you decide to invest in a sizable machine and plan to use it in multiple rooms, look for features like wheels or a handle to make the process of moving it around easier on you. If you’re planning to have a purifier stay in one room, though, portability is less of an issue.

Additional Features

Some air purifiers for pets have extra features to make your air filtration experience even easier. Certain machines come with remotes, allowing you to adjust settings from across the room, and some have apps, so you can make changes from practically anywhere. A turbo boost setting, which allows the purifier to quickly spring into action, is also helpful. If you prefer a more hands-off air purifier experience, consider a machine with sensors to detect the quality of your air and respond accordingly.

In this article I showcase the total return strategy used by Ronald Muhlenkamp and give you a list of stocks currently passing the AAII Muhlenkamp screen. The Muhlenkamp approach seeks companies with high return on equity (ROE) ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index’s 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds—he still uses it today. Muhlenkamp founded Muhlenkamp & Co. in 1977 to manage accounts for individuals and institutions and launched the Muhlenkamp und (MUHLX) in 1988. Muhlenkamp takes a total return approach to investing, seeking out investments that offer the best return prospects relative to their risk. While Muhlenkamp is normally invested in stocks, he can invest in bonds if they are attractive relative to domestic or foreign stocks, and small or large companies. The complete public market makes up his investment universe.

The Muhlenkamp Approach

Muhlenkamp uses a bottom-up approach to selecting stocks, but adjusts his benchmarks based on the broad economic environment. Muhlenkamp begins by looking for companies with a return on equity above the average return on equity since World War II, which was 14.0% at the time of his writing.

Return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence. The measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder’s equity. It relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm. Stockholder’s equity is equal to the total assets of the firm less all debt and liabilities. Also known as stockowner’s equity, owners’ equity, book value or even simply equity, it represents investors’ ownership interest in the company. On the balance sheet, it is the sum of preferred stock, common stock and retained earnings.

Muhlenkamp looks for an above-average return on equity, but the price he is willing to pay for that company depends on the current and expected levels of inflation and interest rates.

Muhlenkamp uses prevailing inflation and interest rates to help establish his investing hurdles. Higher inflation leads to higher required interest rates, and stocks must therefore be priced more affordably to attract investors. The end result is that in a high inflation and high interest rate environment, price-earnings (P/E) ratios should be relatively low.

Building The Muhlenkamp Screen

While much of Muhlenkamp’s approach is qualitative, AAII has some quantitative data to construct a basic screen to seek companies with high return on equity ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. AAII’s Stock Investor Pro screening and database program was used to construct the screen. Criteria are based on historical data and are not adjusted for current inflation.

Sustainable Return On Equity

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable. The next filter looks for companies whose average return on equity over the last five years is also above 12.0%. This helps highlight companies that have performed consistently. If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Reasonable Price

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Secondary Factors

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there’s good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company’s bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin—net income divided by sales—reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm’s net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow—cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments—be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Conclusion

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

CULT MIA

Nina Briance, Founder & CEO of Cult Mia, is transforming the online luxury fashion marketplace by curating exclusive, one-of-a-kind collections from the world’s newest independent designers. As traditional luxury platforms struggle with stagnation and a lack of distinction, Cult Mia shines by focusing on what today’s shoppers truly seek: unique, ethically made fashion that reflects their individuality.

Cult Mia’s rigorous designer selection process ensures that every featured brand meets high standards for quality, exclusivity, and social impact. Out of approximately 275 designers who apply each month, only 10% are accepted. Briance and her team have implemented a sourcing strategy prioritizing ethical, transparent, and responsible practices. “We have a clear baseline for brands joining our platform. Our requirements include responsible production, use of sustainable materials, and a commitment to broader social and environmental impact. Based on their performance in these areas, we rank brands into different sustainability or impact categories, providing them with guidance and support to improve their practices while they are on our platform,” Briance explains.

CULT MIA

Cult Mia offers over 55,000 products from 350 brands spanning 42 countries, with more than 40% of these brands exclusive to the platform. This exclusivity has made Cult Mia the go-to destination for millennial and Gen Z shoppers seeking fashion that reflects their personal identity. According to the company’s surveys, Cult Mia customers are loyal, bold fashion enthusiasts for whom fashion is integral to self-expression. The platform’s items typically range from £250 to £2,500, positioning Cult Mia within the luxury segment, with an average order value of £670.

Recently, Cult Mia introduced a community-led sourcing feature that allows customers to share their favorite designer discoveries from around the world. Travelers can tag and submit unique brands they encounter, which Cult Mia can then showcase—crediting the contributors. This feature empowers the community to curate and share global fashion finds with a broader audience. “We celebrate the unique and the independent. Every purchase on Cult Mia supports a designer who is shaping the future of fashion and aligns with both our and our customers’ values,” Briance shares.

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

CULT MIA




As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index’s 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds—he still uses it today. Muhlenkamp founded Muhlenkamp & Co. in 1977 to manage accounts for individuals and institutions and launched the Muhlenkamp und (MUHLX) in 1988. Muhlenkamp takes a total return approach to investing, seeking out investments that offer the best return prospects relative to their risk. While Muhlenkamp is normally invested in stocks, he can invest in bonds if they are attractive relative to domestic or foreign stocks, and small or large companies. The complete public market makes up his investment universe.

The Muhlenkamp Approach

Muhlenkamp uses a bottom-up approach to selecting stocks, but adjusts his benchmarks based on the broad economic environment. Muhlenkamp begins by looking for companies with a return on equity above the average return on equity since World War II, which was 14.0% at the time of his writing.

Return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence. The measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder’s equity. It relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm. Stockholder’s equity is equal to the total assets of the firm less all debt and liabilities. Also known as stockowner’s equity, owners’ equity, book value or even simply equity, it represents investors’ ownership interest in the company. On the balance sheet, it is the sum of preferred stock, common stock and retained earnings.

Muhlenkamp looks for an above-average return on equity, but the price he is willing to pay for that company depends on the current and expected levels of inflation and interest rates.

Muhlenkamp uses prevailing inflation and interest rates to help establish his investing hurdles. Higher inflation leads to higher required interest rates, and stocks must therefore be priced more affordably to attract investors. The end result is that in a high inflation and high interest rate environment, price-earnings (P/E) ratios should be relatively low.

Building The Muhlenkamp Screen

While much of Muhlenkamp’s approach is qualitative, AAII has some quantitative data to construct a basic screen to seek companies with high return on equity ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. AAII’s Stock Investor Pro screening and database program was used to construct the screen. Criteria are based on historical data and are not adjusted for current inflation.

Sustainable Return On Equity

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable. The next filter looks for companies whose average return on equity over the last five years is also above 12.0%. This helps highlight companies that have performed consistently. If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Reasonable Price

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Secondary Factors

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there’s good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company’s bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin—net income divided by sales—reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm’s net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow—cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments—be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Conclusion

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

CULT MIA

Nina Briance, Founder & CEO of Cult Mia, is transforming the online luxury fashion marketplace by curating exclusive, one-of-a-kind collections from the world’s newest independent designers. As traditional luxury platforms struggle with stagnation and a lack of distinction, Cult Mia shines by focusing on what today’s shoppers truly seek: unique, ethically made fashion that reflects their individuality.

Cult Mia’s rigorous designer selection process ensures that every featured brand meets high standards for quality, exclusivity, and social impact. Out of approximately 275 designers who apply each month, only 10% are accepted. Briance and her team have implemented a sourcing strategy prioritizing ethical, transparent, and responsible practices. “We have a clear baseline for brands joining our platform. Our requirements include responsible production, use of sustainable materials, and a commitment to broader social and environmental impact. Based on their performance in these areas, we rank brands into different sustainability or impact categories, providing them with guidance and support to improve their practices while they are on our platform,” Briance explains.

Cult Mia offers over 55,000 products from 350 brands spanning 42 countries, with more than 40% of these brands exclusive to the platform. This exclusivity has made Cult Mia the go-to destination for millennial and Gen Z shoppers seeking fashion that reflects their personal identity. According to the company’s surveys, Cult Mia customers are loyal, bold fashion enthusiasts for whom fashion is integral to self-expression. The platform’s items typically range from £250 to £2,500, positioning Cult Mia within the luxury segment, with an average order value of £670.

Recently, Cult Mia introduced a community-led sourcing feature that allows customers to share their favorite designer discoveries from around the world. Travelers can tag and submit unique brands they encounter, which Cult Mia can then showcase—crediting the contributors. This feature empowers the community to curate and share global fashion finds with a broader audience. “We celebrate the unique and the independent. Every purchase on Cult Mia supports a designer who is shaping the future of fashion and aligns with both our and our customers’ values,” Briance shares.

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

UNSPLASH

Once a year, I have the privilege of stepping back to spend time with some of the world’s smartest, most forward-thinking business leaders.

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points today (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. For bitcoin, a unique asset often heralded as a hedge against central bank mismanagement, this decision introduces both opportunities and possible near-term risks.

A Signal of Economic Trouble?

The Fed’s decision to cut by 50 bps represents more than just monetary policy adjustment – it’s a clear acknowledgment that the economy is struggling more than policymakers have publicly let on. After a year of aggressive tightening aimed at taming inflation, this shift signals that the central bank is now in damage control mode. It reflects growing anxiety over potential recessionary forces, stagnating job growth, and the underlying structural weaknesses in the financial system.

BitcoinBitcoin -1.8% has traditionally thrived on economic uncertainty, positioning itself as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. However, today’s rate cut presents a more complex reality. While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon – a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s Short-Term Trajectory: Volatility or Opportunity?

For bitcoin, the 50 bps cut sends mixed signals. Historically, rate cuts have been positive for hard assets like bitcoin, as such cuts are inflationary, leading to capital find its way into assets that can serve as stores of value. But this rate cut doesn’t feel like a traditional monetary easing; rather, it’s a borderline emergency response to growing economic instability. If the markets interpret this cut as a sign that the U.S. economy is in deeper trouble than anticipated, bitcoin could be caught in a risk-off selloff.

In recent weeks, bitcoin has struggled to hold onto the gains it made earlier in the summer. After reaching highs of $65,000 in August, its exchange rate with the dollar slipped under $59,000, reflecting broader market uncertainty and concerns about the Fed’s next move. With today’s 50 bps cut, bitcoin could face even more turbulence in the coming weeks as investors reassess the state of the economy.

Today’s rate cut comes against a backdrop of growing macroeconomic instability. The U.S. labor market, which had been resilient in 2022, is showing signs of strain. Last week’s jobs report revealed troubling data, with the U.S. economy creating fewer jobs than expected and a notable rise in unemployment to 7.1 million. This weakness, coupled with sluggish consumer spending and declining industrial output, paints a picture of an economy that may be slipping into a recession.

Globally, the picture is equally concerning. Europe remains mired in stagnation, with the Eurozone posting lackluster GDP growth of just 0.2% last quarter. In Japan, the central bank faces mounting inflationary pressures while attempting to unwind decades of ultra-loose monetary policy. Meanwhile, China’s economy continues to falter, with a slowdown in factory output, consumption, and rising unemployment threatening its once-robust growth engine.

The Fed’s 50 bps cut, therefore, isn’t just about managing U.S. economic risks; it’s about responding to a global slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for all asset markets. For bitcoin, this means navigating a highly volatile environment where macroeconomic forces exert influence on price movements that is difficult to predict.

Bitcoin’s Role in a Shifting Global Financial Landscape

Despite the short-term volatility that this aggressive rate cut may introduce, the long-term case for bitcoin remains strong. As central banks around the world grapple with economic weakness, their collective response is to increase the supply of money. Whether through rate cuts, quantitative easing, or other forms of liquidity injections, the financial system is increasingly reliant on monetary expansion to maintain even modest growth. In such an environment, bitcoin will continue to be valued as a global financial network independent of any single jurisdiction or central bank policy.

In the long run, this wave of monetary easing will likely reinforce bitcoin’s appeal to those seeking refuge from fiat debasement. However, in the short term, the price of bitcoin may be subject to increased volatility, particularly as the market digests the implications of today’s 50 bps cut.

Short-Term Turbulence, Long-Term Strength

The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of global economic instability. For bitcoin, this could mean a turbulent few months ahead as markets react to the potential for a deeper economic downturn. However, as central banks resort to repeated monetary intervention, bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to strengthen.

In a world where fiat-based economies face ever-growing pressure from mismanagement and politicization, bitcoin continues to offer a compelling alternative. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but those with conviction in bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, sound money system will see today’s rate cut as another step toward validating its long-term value."

Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate today by 0.5%, targeting a range between 4.75% and 5%. An interest rate cut was largely expected across markets, as seen in the CME FedWatch Tool. However, market expectations were divided between a 0.25% and a 0.5% rate cut.

A rate cut of 0.5% is bigger than many market participants had expected, and it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable. Given the relatively solid labor market but elevated consumer inflation, future interest rate cuts are coming, although the Fed still has the license to cut interest rates slowly.

Federal Reserve Forecasts Reflect Future Rate Cuts

Investors, economists, and business leaders anticipated an interest rate cut on September 18. They were also eagerly awaiting the quarterly forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee, especially the FOMC member median forecasts of future interest rates.

Accompanying the September 18 Fed decision, FOMC forecasts were released in a table with interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appeared in a graphic depiction that economists and investors refer to as the dot plot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

As Prestige Economics expected, the dot plot of median FOMC member forecasts conveyed that Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

The last set of FOMC forecasts was released in June 2024. The FOMC median forecast of interest rates was 5.1% for the end of 2024, 4.1% for the end of 2025, and 3.1% for the end of 2026.

The updated September FOMC median forecast of interest rates was lowered to 4.4% for the end of 2024, lowered to 3.4% for the end of 2025, and lowered to 2.9% for the end of 2026.

Fed member forecasts of future real GDP growth remain relatively positive and inflation is expected to improve more than previously forecast. Unemployment is expected to be weaker than previously forecast.

The median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 unemployment rate was raised to 4.4% from 4%. Meanwhile, the median year-on-year real GDP forecast for Q4 2024 was lowered slightly to 2% from 2.1%.

On the upside, the median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 year-on-year PCE and Core PCE inflation improved, although they are expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target in both Q4 2024 and Q4 2025.

Market Implications

The September Fed rate cut was bigger than some investors had expected, even though the CME FedWatch Tool had reflected the 65% chance of a 0.5% rate cut as of 9:30 a.m. ET on September 18.

A larger-than-expected interest rate cut often presents upside risks to equity and bond prices while weighing on the dollar. Plus, the September interest rate cut is expected by the FOMC to be one of many cuts, which is also supportive of equity and bond prices and bearish for the greenback. This is especially true, given the FOMC forecasts of more interest rate cuts than previously published.

As always, this isn’t the end of the Fed’s story today, and a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks in his 2:30 p.m. ET press conference on September 18, especially about the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts.

GETTY

In this article I showcase the total return strategy used by Ronald Muhlenkamp and give you a list of stocks currently passing the AAII Muhlenkamp screen. The Muhlenkamp approach seeks companies with high return on equity (ROE) ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index’s 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds—he still uses it today. Muhlenkamp founded Muhlenkamp & Co. in 1977 to manage accounts for individuals and institutions and launched the Muhlenkamp und (MUHLX) in 1988. Muhlenkamp takes a total return approach to investing, seeking out investments that offer the best return prospects relative to their risk. While Muhlenkamp is normally invested in stocks, he can invest in bonds if they are attractive relative to domestic or foreign stocks, and small or large companies. The complete public market makes up his investment universe.

The Muhlenkamp Approach

Muhlenkamp uses a bottom-up approach to selecting stocks, but adjusts his benchmarks based on the broad economic environment. Muhlenkamp begins by looking for companies with a return on equity above the average return on equity since World War II, which was 14.0% at the time of his writing.

Return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence. The measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder’s equity. It relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm. Stockholder’s equity is equal to the total assets of the firm less all debt and liabilities. Also known as stockowner’s equity, owners’ equity, book value or even simply equity, it represents investors’ ownership interest in the company. On the balance sheet, it is the sum of preferred stock, common stock and retained earnings.

Muhlenkamp looks for an above-average return on equity, but the price he is willing to pay for that company depends on the current and expected levels of inflation and interest rates.

Muhlenkamp uses prevailing inflation and interest rates to help establish his investing hurdles. Higher inflation leads to higher required interest rates, and stocks must therefore be priced more affordably to attract investors. The end result is that in a high inflation and high interest rate environment, price-earnings (P/E) ratios should be relatively low.

Building The Muhlenkamp Screen

While much of Muhlenkamp’s approach is qualitative, AAII has some quantitative data to construct a basic screen to seek companies with high return on equity ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. AAII’s Stock Investor Pro screening and database program was used to construct the screen. Criteria are based on historical data and are not adjusted for current inflation.

Sustainable Return On Equity

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable. The next filter looks for companies whose average return on equity over the last five years is also above 12.0%. This helps highlight companies that have performed consistently. If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Reasonable Price

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Secondary Factors

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there’s good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company’s bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin—net income divided by sales—reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm’s net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow—cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments—be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Conclusion

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

Those words from Vice President Kamala Harris signal a major shift in higher education policy, one which recognizes that earning a college degree costs too much, and not every job should require one.

TOPSHOT - US Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at a ... [+]

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

Since the late 1960s, progressives have supported the expansion of financial aid for college in the belief that a college degree was the key to expanding the American Dream. Pell Grants, student loans, and college tax incentives were all enacted and expanded under Democratic Administrations.

For many years this strategy worked. College enrollments dramatically increased, rising from 8.5 million in 1970 and peaking at around 21 million in 2010. In addition, there are now more women undergraduates than men and some 45% of students come from diverse populations.

But this policy also has a cost. The expansion of federal aid for higher education allowed colleges to raise tuition at rates far exceeding inflation, and total student loan debt is now more than $1.74 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

As Taylor Maag noted in a paper for the center-left think tank PPI , most Americans (62%) do not have a college degree, yet we spend 3 times as much on aid for higher education than we do for workforce development. Furthermore, colleges and universities have not done their part to make sure that those students are paying a fair price. Instead, they have dramatically increased the size of their administrative workforce, tried to cover up their unwillingness to manage expenditures with higher tuition and more junk fees (like charging students a fee to graduate), created more online degrees, and dramatically increased the number of international students who can afford to pay full price.

Vice President Harris’ proposal recognizes we cannot simply subsidize our way out of this problem. It acknowledges that young Americans have choices, and if they exercise them, they may find a better path towards success. For this she should be applauded.

But it’s also time to call on colleges and universities to do their fair share. Getting the cost of tuition and fees under control must become a priority if taxpayers are going to continue to be asked to subsidize the cost of a college education. This means college and university presidents must cut costs and reduce administrative bloat. They also need to charge faculty with redesigning their curriculum so that more students can finish degrees in 3 years (and cut tuition costs by up to 25%), as they do in other countries.

A future Harris Administration could help move this process forward by tying future increases in student financial aid to real reductions in the cost of tuition and fees. They could also mandate, as states like Texas and Ohio have, that schools reward students for work completed before they enroll in college, such as automatically awarding credit for scores of 3 on AP exams.

Vice President Harris has taken an important step in the right direction on higher education policy. Recognizing that college is important, but not the only pathway to success, shows she understands that young Americans deserve more choice when it comes to their future careers. By leveraging the purchasing power of the federal government, she can create more opportunity for those who chose not to earn a college degree, as well as making college more affordable by holding school presidents more accountable."

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

CULT MIA




As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

In this article I showcase the total return strategy used by Ronald Muhlenkamp and give you a list of stocks currently passing the AAII Muhlenkamp screen. The Muhlenkamp approach seeks companies with high return on equity (ROE) ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index’s 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds—he still uses it today.

Sustainable Return On Equity

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable.

If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Reasonable Price

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there’s good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company’s bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin—net income divided by sales—reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm’s net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow—cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments—be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Conclusion

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

OXYGEN TRUE CRIME

Oxygen, the home of true-crime programming, has announced the new documentary Family Secrets: The Disappearance Of Alissa Turney, which will cover the true story of Alissa Turney, who went missing as a teen in 2001 and has never been found. Her stepfather was charged but later acquitted of her murder.

Alissa Turney’s sister, Sarah Turney, who hosts the true crime podcast Voices for Justice, spoke out when she posted suspicions on social media that her father killed Alissa. Per the logline, “Now Sarah gives unprecedented access to the continuation of her story, including a recently unearthed trove of home videos, as she re-examines her and Alissa’s childhood. Sarah makes chilling discoveries, breaking through years of manipulation to reconstruct the truth of the past and be free of her father’s influence. Sarah’s final conversation with her father is haunting and a testament to her tenacity and unending search for Alissa.”

Family Secrets: The Disappearance of Alissa Turney premieres Sunday, October 13 at 8 p.m. ET on Oxygen True Crime. Peacock will stream an extended version of the documentary beginning Tuesday, October 22.

Peacock’s version of the documentary will include expanded and new sections. According to the logline: “Notable footage includes Alissa’s friends providing intimate details of their friendship with her, an investigation of Sarah and Alissa’s father’s manipulative relationship with Alissa and other family members and friends, and a deeper look at Sarah’s advocacy on social media and through her podcasts, Voices for Justice and Media Pressure, which empowers victims of violence and their loved ones to speak out.”

“As filmmakers, we wanted to explore the shifting nature of truth and how someone who had been groomed to believe one version of reality could relearn her own memories,” said directors Ricki Stern and Jesse Sweet in a statement. “We crafted the film to embody Sarah’s journey of excavating the truth about herself, her family and what happened to her sister. We are grateful to Sarah for welcoming us into her life and opening up her family archive in support of this vision.""

Family Secrets: The Disappearance of Alissa Turney is produced by Story Syndicate. Dan Cogan, Liz Garbus, Jon Bardin, Kate Barry, Mala Chapple, Ricki Stern, Jesse Sweet and Sarah Turney executive produce. Ricki Stern and Jesse Sweet direct.

In general, air purifiers are helpful for capturing extremely small particles which “can become aerosolized with activities such as fluffing pillows or using the vacuum,” says Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine. “An air purifier can extract these airborne allergens and provides improved overall air quality.” Before you look for the best model for your home, you want to consider factors like the type of filter the device uses, the size of the room in which it will be stationed and, of course, your budget.

This story was written by lifestyle contributor Korin Miller and is overseen by Forbes Vetted’s team of experienced home and kitchen editors.
To ensure we had the best sense of what to look for in an air purifier for pets, we consulted with two medical experts with specialties in allergy and asthma: Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network; and Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine.
We regularly review our selection of the best air purifiers for pets to make sure it is as up to date as possible. This story was last updated in September 2024.

How We Chose The Best Air Purifiers For Pets

To choose the best air purifiers for pets, we focused on the top devices from trusted brands such as Levoit, Bissell, Coway and Honeywell.

We sifted through customer reviews, ensuring each pick had mostly positive feedback (particularly accounting for reviews from pet owners) and an average rating of four stars or more.
We consulted two medical experts with a focus on allergy and immunology to get their input on the most important characteristics to focus on.
Each product was analyzed for features like efficiency, coverage area, design, filtering performance and value. In making the final selections, we kept various lifestyles and budgets in mind.

What To Look For In A Pet Air Purifier

A quality pet air purifier can pull dander and other allergens out of your air, as well as telltale odors that come with pet ownership. When picking out an air purifier for pets, consider these key factors.

Filtration

The goal of an air purifier for pets is to pull pet dander and other allergens out of your home’s air. While many machines can do this, each has its own filtration system and number of filters. HEPA filters are considered the gold standard, given that they can trap very small particles. If pet odors is a big concern, look for a purifier with a charcoal filter—these tamp down on smells by trapping odor-causing particles within the filter. Some purifiers will also have a pre-filter, which is helpful for removing larger items like pet hair from your air.

Fan Speed

Most air purifiers have more than one fan speed, but some have three or more options to flip through. If you tend to deal with intense odors or air quality issues after, say, cooking steak or having a wet dog troop through your home, a turbo fan speed can be helpful to clean your air fast. Many people who sleep with an air purifier running also appreciate having a purifier with a sleep mode, which is typically quiet. Most people toggle through two or so speeds, but some prefer more.

Portability

Air purifiers for pets come in a wide selection of sizes. Petite models are usually simple to transfer between rooms, but larger machines can pose more of a challenge. If you decide to invest in a sizable machine and plan to use it in multiple rooms, look for features like wheels or a handle to make the process of moving it around easier on you. If you’re planning to have a purifier stay in one room, though, portability is less of an issue.

Additional Features

Some air purifiers for pets have extra features to make your air filtration experience even easier. Certain machines come with remotes, allowing you to adjust settings from across the room, and some have apps, so you can make changes from practically anywhere. A turbo boost setting, which allows the purifier to quickly spring into action, is also helpful. If you prefer a more hands-off air purifier experience, consider a machine with sensors to detect the quality of your air and respond accordingly.

CHAPPAQUA CHILDREN'S BOOK FESTIVAL

Now in its eleventh year, the Chappaqua Children's Book Festival will take place on Saturday, September 28th, from 10 AM to 4 PM.

This annual event stands out as one of the nation's largest book festivals dedicated solely to children's literature. Throughout the day, participants will have the unique opportunity to interact with authors, listen to readings, and obtain autographed copies of their favorite books.

The festival's ambitious goal is to foster a love of reading and exploration of different genres, nurturing a lifelong passion for literature and learning in young minds.

Spreading the Passion for Books

Dawn Evans Greenberg, a Chappaqua resident whose publishing career spans over three decades, has been the driving force behind this grassroots, all-volunteer effort and serves as its Executive Director.

“I believe one single book can save a life,” says Greenberg. Books saved me as a child — they were my escape and inspiration. And I know from my own kids that a foundation of reading makes all the difference in academic success, world view, empathy, and just fun.”

...One single book can save a life.

Dawn Evans Greenberg, Executive Director, CCBF

“So many kids can see themselves in a book about mental health struggles, LGBTQ issues, social justice, or biographies. We try to bring in lots of those kinds of books — sometimes banned or challenged — but always worthwhile for the right reader,” she adds.

Forging Connections Between Authors and Readers

Each year, the festival features over 1,000 books catering to various age groups, ethnicities, interests, genres, and reading abilities.

Laura Numeroff, author of the award-winning If You Give A Mouse A Cookie series, will headline this year’s festival.

Attendees will also meet Vashti Harrison, 2024 Caldecott Medal winner, and Dan Santat, New York Times bestselling author and winner of the 2023 National Book Award for Young People.

Among the dozens of other children's authors promised to attend are Victoria Kann (author of Pinkalicious), Jane Yolen, Bryan Collier, Nikki Grimes, Kyle Lukoff, Tracy West, Elizabeth Lim, E.B. Lewis, Winsome Bingham, and Lisa Rogers. (See the complete list of participating authors.)

Food and Fun, Too

The Bubble Bus will be at The Chappaqua Children's Book FestivaI.

GETTY

Since its inception in 2013, this crowd-pleasing festival has grown from 65 to 165 authors and 4,000 to 10,000 attendees.

Beyond author talks and readings, illustrator demonstrations, and on-site book sales, the festival will see the return of the beloved Bubble Bus, known for delighting and entertaining with its whimsical bubbles. Gourmet food trucks and vendors from the Chappaqua Farmers Market will also be on site.

Visitors can take a leisurely stroll through the hamlet's charming downtown area, which offers unique shops and eateries within easy walking distance of the festival's convenient location at the train station. History buffs shouldn’t miss stopping at the nearby Horace Greeley House Museum that offers a glimpse into the past of this interesting town.

Chappaqua, a leafy Westchester County hamlet, is less than an hour from Manhattan by car or from Grand Central Station on Metro North. Perfect for an autumn family outing, the festival typically attracts book lovers from the tri-state area and beyond.

“I'm thrilled that the love of reading is more alive and well than ever,” says Greenberg.

CULT MIA

Nina Briance, Founder & CEO of Cult Mia, is transforming the online luxury fashion marketplace by curating exclusive, one-of-a-kind collections from the world’s newest independent designers. As traditional luxury platforms struggle with stagnation and a lack of distinction, Cult Mia shines by focusing on what today’s shoppers truly seek: unique, ethically made fashion that reflects their individuality.

Cult Mia’s rigorous designer selection process ensures that every featured brand meets high standards for quality, exclusivity, and social impact. Out of approximately 275 designers who apply each month, only 10% are accepted. Briance and her team have implemented a sourcing strategy prioritizing ethical, transparent, and responsible practices. “We have a clear baseline for brands joining our platform. Our requirements include responsible production, use of sustainable materials, and a commitment to broader social and environmental impact. Based on their performance in these areas, we rank brands into different sustainability or impact categories, providing them with guidance and support to improve their practices while they are on our platform,” Briance explains.

Pleated Evening Gown 

CULT MIA

Cult Mia offers over 55,000 products from 350 brands spanning 42 countries, with more than 40% of these brands exclusive to the platform. This exclusivity has made Cult Mia the go-to destination for millennial and Gen Z shoppers seeking fashion that reflects their personal identity. According to the company’s surveys, Cult Mia customers are loyal, bold fashion enthusiasts for whom fashion is integral to self-expression. The platform’s items typically range from £250 to £2,500, positioning Cult Mia within the luxury segment, with an average order value of £670.

Recently, Cult Mia introduced a community-led sourcing feature that allows customers to share their favorite designer discoveries from around the world. Travelers can tag and submit unique brands they encounter, which Cult Mia can then showcase—crediting the contributors. This feature empowers the community to curate and share global fashion finds with a broader audience. “We celebrate the unique and the independent. Every purchase on Cult Mia supports a designer who is shaping the future of fashion and aligns with both our and our customers’ values,” Briance shares.

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

CULT MIA




As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms.

GETTY

In this article I showcase the total return strategy used by Ronald Muhlenkamp and give you a list of stocks currently passing the AAII Muhlenkamp screen. The Muhlenkamp approach seeks companies with high return on equity (ROE) ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. As of August 30, 2024, our Muhlenkamp screening model has an average annual gain of 26.4% over the past five years, versus the S&P 500 index’s 12.4% return over the same period.

Muhlenkamp has devoted his entire business career to the professional management of investment portfolios. Muhlenkamp started his career as a portfolio analyst and soon was directly managing assets. In the early 1970s, Muhlenkamp undertook an extensive study of both fundamental and technical investing philosophies and practices and developed a proprietary method for evaluating both stocks and bonds—he still uses it today. Muhlenkamp founded Muhlenkamp & Co. in 1977 to manage accounts for individuals and institutions and launched the Muhlenkamp und (MUHLX) in 1988. Muhlenkamp takes a total return approach to investing, seeking out investments that offer the best return prospects relative to their risk. While Muhlenkamp is normally invested in stocks, he can invest in bonds if they are attractive relative to domestic or foreign stocks, and small or large companies. The complete public market makes up his investment universe.

The Muhlenkamp Approach

Muhlenkamp uses a bottom-up approach to selecting stocks, but adjusts his benchmarks based on the broad economic environment. Muhlenkamp begins by looking for companies with a return on equity above the average return on equity since World War II, which was 14.0% at the time of his writing.

Return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence. The measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder’s equity. It relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm. Stockholder’s equity is equal to the total assets of the firm less all debt and liabilities. Also known as stockowner’s equity, owners’ equity, book value or even simply equity, it represents investors’ ownership interest in the company. On the balance sheet, it is the sum of preferred stock, common stock and retained earnings.

Muhlenkamp looks for an above-average return on equity, but the price he is willing to pay for that company depends on the current and expected levels of inflation and interest rates.

Muhlenkamp uses prevailing inflation and interest rates to help establish his investing hurdles. Higher inflation leads to higher required interest rates, and stocks must therefore be priced more affordably to attract investors. The end result is that in a high inflation and high interest rate environment, price-earnings (P/E) ratios should be relatively low.

Building The Muhlenkamp Screen

While much of Muhlenkamp’s approach is qualitative, AAII has some quantitative data to construct a basic screen to seek companies with high return on equity ratios that are trading at reasonable prices. AAII’s Stock Investor Pro screening and database program was used to construct the screen. Criteria are based on historical data and are not adjusted for current inflation.

Sustainable Return On Equity

The first filter looks for companies with a current return on equity (earnings per share over the most current 12 months divided by book value per share as of the latest quarter) greater than 12.0%.

Muhlenkamp seeks good companies trading at a discount. The return on equity should be stable and sustainable. The next filter looks for companies whose average return on equity over the last five years is also above 12.0%. This helps highlight companies that have performed consistently. If you wish to use a more stringent screen, you can specify a high return on equity for each of the last five years. Averages can be skewed due to a few very strong or weak years.

Reasonable Price

Muhlenkamp wants to acquire companies that are attractively priced relative to bond rates and inflation. The Muhlenkamp screen requires a current price-earnings ratio below 17.0. This number is based on historical data and has not been adjusted for current inflation.

Secondary Factors

Muhlenkamp feels that the smaller the company, the more you have to get to know management. But by and large, if there’s good management, it comes through in the numbers. His analysis looks at companies in four ways: growth, profits, financial strength and labor relations.

Growth is an important consideration in a number of ways. The relationship between growth and return on equity is key. If the return on equity is higher than the growth rate, the company is probably generating free cash flow. An important consideration is how the company uses this excess cash.

Growth rates higher than the return on equity are not sustainable in the long run without additional equity or debt financing. Taking on debt has absolute limits and must be done carefully by companies in volatile industries. Issuing additional equity dilutes the ownership of existing shareholders, making their stock worth less on a per-share basis. Muhlenkamp prefers companies with a return on equity that can comfortably fund growth.

The first set of growth filters seeks companies with positive growth in earnings per share over the last five years that have experienced higher growth than the norm for their industry.

Sales growth, or top-line growth, drives the company’s bottom line. Revenue tells you whether the public is buying the product. The next filter requires that the five-year growth in sales be greater than or equal to the five-year growth in earnings per share.

Profit is another critical factor. Muhlenkamp points out that the way to make profit is cost control, so he always looks at this factor. The net profit margin—net income divided by sales—reflects how efficient a firm is in operations, administration, financing and tax management per sales dollar. The greater and more stable the net profit margin, the better. A gain in profit margin translates into a gain in earnings for a given level of sales. Industry comparisons are critical for all of the profitability ratios.

Margins vary from industry to industry. A high margin relative to an industry norm may point to a company with an advantage over its competitors. The advantage may range from patent protection to a highly efficient operation running near capacity.

The Muhlenkamp screen requires that a firm’s net margin exceed the industry median.

Muhlenkamp then looks at the strength of the balance sheet. What do the finances look like? Is the company going to need more capital one of these days?

While the use of debt can help boost the return on equity when the company is performing strongly, it can also saddle the company with interest payments that must be made throughout the business cycle, thereby slowing return on equity when business slows down and increasing the risk that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments.

Basic leverage screens look at factors such as debt to equity or liabilities to assets. Companies in more stable industries can safely assume greater levels of debt. The Muhlenkamp screen first looks for companies that have a percentage of liabilities to assets that is lower than their industry median. The screen then requires that free cash flow—cash flow from operations less capital expenditures (capex) and dividend payments—be positive.

The fourth factor that Muhlenkamp studies is labor relations. This is very much a qualitative screen that must be considered when examining candidates passing all of the filters.

Additional filters were added requiring minimum liquidity by specifying that a stock be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq or the NYSE American. Finally, foreign-listed stocks trading as American depositary receipts (ADRs) were excluded.

Conclusion

Muhlenkamp attributes his long-term success to sticking with something that works while keeping an open mind.

Muhlenkamp provides a helpful framework to consider economic and market conditions when selecting stocks. Like all screens, our interpretation of the Muhlenkamp approach represents a starting point for further analysis.

Our vast library of home and kitchen stories includes extensive coverage on air purifiers, including our main story on the best air purifiers, the best air purifiers for smoke and the best air purifiers for allergies.
This story was written by lifestyle contributor Korin Miller and is overseen by Forbes Vetted’s team of experienced home and kitchen editors.
To ensure we had the best sense of what to look for in an air purifier for pets, we consulted with two medical experts with specialties in allergy and asthma: Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network; and Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine.
We regularly review our selection of the best air purifiers for pets to make sure it is as up to date as possible. This story was last updated in September 2024.

How We Chose The Best Air Purifiers For Pets

To choose the best air purifiers for pets, we focused on the top devices from trusted brands such as Levoit, Bissell, Coway and Honeywell.

We sifted through customer reviews, ensuring each pick had mostly positive feedback (particularly accounting for reviews from pet owners) and an average rating of four stars or more.
We consulted two medical experts with a focus on allergy and immunology to get their input on the most important characteristics to focus on.
Each product was analyzed for features like efficiency, coverage area, design, filtering performance and value. In making the final selections, we kept various lifestyles and budgets in mind.

What To Look For In A Pet Air Purifier

A quality pet air purifier can pull dander and other allergens out of your air, as well as telltale odors that come with pet ownership. When picking out an air purifier for pets, consider these key factors.

Filtration

The goal of an air purifier for pets is to pull pet dander and other allergens out of your home’s air. While many machines can do this, each has its own filtration system and number of filters. HEPA filters are considered the gold standard, given that they can trap very small particles. If pet odors is a big concern, look for a purifier with a charcoal filter—these tamp down on smells by trapping odor-causing particles within the filter. Some purifiers will also have a pre-filter, which is helpful for removing larger items like pet hair from your air.

Fan Speed

Most air purifiers have more than one fan speed, but some have three or more options to flip through. If you tend to deal with intense odors or air quality issues after, say, cooking steak or having a wet dog troop through your home, a turbo fan speed can be helpful to clean your air fast. Many people who sleep with an air purifier running also appreciate having a purifier with a sleep mode, which is typically quiet. Most people toggle through two or so speeds, but some prefer more.

Portability

Air purifiers for pets come in a wide selection of sizes. Petite models are usually simple to transfer between rooms, but larger machines can pose more of a challenge. If you decide to invest in a sizable machine and plan to use it in multiple rooms, look for features like wheels or a handle to make the process of moving it around easier on you. If you’re planning to have a purifier stay in one room, though, portability is less of an issue.

Additional Features

Some air purifiers for pets have extra features to make your air filtration experience even easier. Certain machines come with remotes, allowing you to adjust settings from across the room, and some have apps, so you can make changes from practically anywhere. A turbo boost setting, which allows the purifier to quickly spring into action, is also helpful. If you prefer a more hands-off air purifier experience, consider a machine with sensors to detect the quality of your air and respond accordingly.

I was looking at a report lately that shows some of the progress of AI in financial markets, and more specifically, its progress in applications to investment services.

Farsight AI did a survey on 50 industry professionals representing different kinds of financial businesses. (Disclaimer: I am associated with the firm itself.) What they found relates to how AI is being used in the sector…

“The integration of AI to investment banking promises to shift the market landscape, substantially boost efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for growth,” researchers wrote. “However, common drawbacks including lack of customization to templates, sparse data coverage on small, private companies and uncertainty around use cases are currently clouding adoption trends.”

Noting that around 2/3 of investment banks surveyed have at least created a pilot program with AI, the study also found more adoption in boutique and middle market businesses, which the team characterized as investment banks with less than 500 employees. Researchers wrote:

“While larger banks are experimenting with genAI, few apps and use cases are being used consistently in production at that scale. At the mid-market and boutique levels, the encouragement of in-house experimentation, combined with the willingness to work with third-party vendors, has accelerated the time-to-value of genAI apps.”

Here’s another finding that might take some some interpretation:

Study authors said that – “the value perceived by bulge brackets from successful implementations, was significantly higher on a per employee basis than their mid market and boutique peers.”

GETTY

First of all, “bulge brackets” are larger global banks, since I feel like most people would not be inherently familiar with that term. Also, a per employee basis is a strange way to word that. But the idea is that the larger banks get even more bang for their buck, per person.

Survey authors go on to note that that’s because of the scale of the projects initiated by these larger banks. It’s sort of counterintuitive, because you would think that the smaller firms have a lower bar to rank higher on a per employee basis, but perhaps these larger banks develop Cadillac systems that deliver a lot more firepower in general.

The surveyers also mention challenges – security, education and awareness, and change management.

They look at metrics like deal volume, and address the perceived benefits and risks of AI.

Some of the value propositions involve deal making, visibility for brands, and competitive advances.

As for tools, ChatGPT outweighs others with 71% of respondents indicating their firms used this application, compared to 43% for Microsoft Copilot, 29% for Bard and 29% for other tools. (These don’t have to add up to 100% since companies can use more than just one.)

Holy Grail Use Cases

Later on, the study asked people what they would use AI for in an ideal world. Respondents came up with the following:

· Pitch decks

· NDA processing

· Sell side prospecting

· Buyer list generation

· CIM creation

· New deal sourcing

· Market overview

· Contact log management

· Precedent transaction screens

· Modeling checker

· Profile generation

Here’s a number that stood out to me – the assertion that the study found AI can potentially generate up to $1 million annually in value, per employee, in many investment banks.

“Our survey corroborates this potential…” authors wrote.

I’m going to also share a few quotes that were added into a summary of the survey itself:

On AI Awareness: “AI is the buzzword everyone is talking about, but few truly understand its full potential in our field.” — VP, Houlihan Lokey
On Big Tech AI Offerings: “I’m AI-aware, but we haven’t made any real purchases. Microsoft has those in-built tools, but they don’t really take you that far in our job function” — Partner, Edgepoint Capital
On Security Concerns: “We hit the brakes quickly once we saw our junior staff using ChatGPT and Perplexity. There’s a huge potential data issue here, if people can see what we’re searching.” — VP, Dyal & Co
On Potential Market Share Impacts: “AI today allows us to take on more deals that would typically be outside our strike zone. We can get up to speed much more quickly, and generate the necessary content much faster with less.” — MD, Raymond James
On AI’s Impact: “There will be a real competitive advantage for those firms that are able to marry their proprietary knowledge with AI systems that can help across prospect generation, deal execution and content creation in a unique way for each specific firm.” — Partner, Union Square Advisors

What about actionable advice for AI integration into finance?

Survey authors recommended a “crawl, walk, run” approach, prioritizing data security, investing in training, and leveraging partnerships, among other best practices.

This is just one example of how AI is taking off in the financial world. We’re very attuned to these kinds of industry cases, because they start to explain and illustrate how we’re going to be coexisting with these powerful technologies in the future."

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

With the Federal Reserve finally cutting the Federal Funds Rate by 0.50% during its September 18th meeting, interest rates on credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and other types of borrowing should be on their way down. But most types of student loans won't see any impact based on rate cuts — at least not through the end of the year and into next year.

If you have student loan debt from the last few years, you may be wondering if rate cuts from the Fed will impact your personal interest rate, your monthly payment, and the other details of your loan. You may also be wondering if there are steps you can take now to secure a lower rate for your existing debt, including refinancing your loans with a private lender.

How Fed Rate Cuts Impact Federal Student Loans

Rate cuts from the Fed don't move the needle on federal student loan rates for existing loans at all. Certified Student Loan Professional (CSLP) Glenn Sanger-Hodgson of Shonan Gold Financial LLC says this is because federal student loan rates change just once each year on July 1st. The rates set for the year remain in place until June 30th of the following year, when they are adjusted again.

Federal student loan rates are also fixed, meaning any loans disbursed during this period have the same interest rate for the life of the loan. This means changes to interest rates that take place during repayment don't impact loans that have already been disbursed. Since interest rates on federal student loans can't change until July 1st of next year, any future changes will be for new loans disbursed after that date until June 30th of the following year.

Unfortunately, this all means individuals who took out federal student loans in the last year (or any time in the past) are stuck paying the rates they have, for better or for worse.

This isn't great news for those who will or have had loans disbursed after July 1st 2024, when the the interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergrads is 6.53% and the rate for Direct Unsubsidized loans for graduate or professional students is 8.08%.

Fed Rate Cuts And Private Student Loans

Sanger-Hodgson says that those with private student loans, especially variable interest rate loans, are more likely to feel the effect of changes in the federal funds rate. Much like federal student loans, interest rates on private student loans are set based on a benchmark — typically the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus some margin based off of the borrower's creditworthiness. However, private student loan rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions versus federal student loan rates that change once per year.

This means borrowers with private student loans could see their variable rates drop based on Federal Reserve rate cuts. It also means those shopping for private student loans or looking to a private company to refinance their student loans may find more competitive rates now than last year.

Should You Refinance Student Loans?

With interest rates on private student loans potentially on their way down, it's easy to wonder if you could benefit from refinancing. And if you're still in college and comparing your loan options, private student loans may seem more attractive than federal loans as rates continue to drop.

Amanda Elliott, who serves as Associate Director of Financial Aid and Student Finance Advising at Colorado State University Global says that variable-rate private loans for current students may stand out at the moment due to their very low introductory rates after a Fed rate cut.

""This could provide short-term savings on interest,"" she said.

If you have private student loans with a high interest rate, refinancing could help you lock in a lower rate, especially if rates continue to fall due to future Fed rate cuts.

""This can reduce your monthly payments and the total interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.,"" said Elliott.

Still, you'll want to be careful of refinancing federal student loans with a private lender — even if lower rates on private loans make this move seem like a no-brainer. This is because federal student loans come with protections private student loans simply do not, including federal deferment and forbearance options, access to income-driven repayment plans, and access to existing loan forgiveness plans like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). And if broad student loan forgiveness is able to pass in the future, it would likely apply only to federal student loans.

These are some of the reasons people tend to treat federal student loan debt differently than other types of debt, and why Sanger-Hodgson says you should think over the pros and cons and what your goals are first.

""If you need access to income-driven repayment options, then sticking with your federal student loans may be the best option, even if it means having loans with a higher interest rate,"" he says. ""And borrowers who are pursuing forgiveness may be better served staying with federal student loans, especially if the effective interest rate on their forgiven loans is lower than rates available through private refinancing.

The Bottom Line

Will the latest Federal Reserve rate cut impact your student loans? As you can tell from the information I just shared, the answer is ""it depends.""

Federal student loan rates will remain unchanged until at least July 1st of next year, whereas the impact on private student loans will be more immediate. Even so, nobody knows how low rates will fall on private student loans, nor do they know when rates will hit their next floor."

A Federal Reserve policy ... [+]

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

With the Federal Reserve finally cutting the Federal Funds Rate by 0.50% during its September 18th meeting, interest rates on credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and other types of borrowing should be on their way down. But most types of student loans won't see any impact based on rate cuts — at least not through the end of the year and into next year.

If you have student loan debt from the last few years, you may be wondering if rate cuts from the Fed will impact your personal interest rate, your monthly payment, and the other details of your loan. You may also be wondering if there are steps you can take now to secure a lower rate for your existing debt, including refinancing your loans with a private lender.

How Fed Rate Cuts Impact Federal Student Loans

Rate cuts from the Fed don't move the needle on federal student loan rates for existing loans at all. Certified Student Loan Professional (CSLP) Glenn Sanger-Hodgson of Shonan Gold Financial LLC says this is because federal student loan rates change just once each year on July 1st. The rates set for the year remain in place until June 30th of the following year, when they are adjusted again.

Federal student loan rates are also fixed, meaning any loans disbursed during this period have the same interest rate for the life of the loan. This means changes to interest rates that take place during repayment don't impact loans that have already been disbursed. Since interest rates on federal student loans can't change until July 1st of next year, any future changes will be for new loans disbursed after that date until June 30th of the following year.

Unfortunately, this all means individuals who took out federal student loans in the last year (or any time in the past) are stuck paying the rates they have, for better or for worse.

This isn't great news for those who will or have had loans disbursed after July 1st 2024, when the the interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergrads is 6.53% and the rate for Direct Unsubsidized loans for graduate or professional students is 8.08%.

Apple iPhone 16 Release: Your Complete Schedule Through To Onsale Date
By David Phelan

Until now, there was no way for consumers to restore an iPhone wirelessly. You can restore an Apple Watch or Apple TV firmware from an iPhone, and it looks like the iPhone will now be able to do something similar, according to 9to5Mac. To restore an iPhone in this wireless method would be the first time Apple had done this. The publication was able to simulate the new system to see how it works.

It said, “Essentially, when the iPhone 16 enters Recovery Mode for some reason, users can simply place it next to another iPhone or iPad to start the firmware recovery. The other device will download a new iOS firmware and transfer it to the bricked device. This means that a Mac or PC will no longer be needed to fix firmware issues on iOS devices.”

This is a neat way to do it, though it looks like it’s restricted to iPhone 16 series phones, for now at least. That’s because, the report goes on, “The new phones are shipped with a special recovery partition that can manage the entire process regardless of whether the main iOS partition is booted. It’s unclear whether Apple plans to add this system to previous iPhone models in the future or whether this actually requires new hardware.”

Even if it’s only the latest model that this works for, it’s a big benefit and much easier than connecting to a PC or, worse, taking the iPhone to an Apple Store to be fixed.

It seems it’s something Apple has been working on for four years, but it’s only now coming to fruition.

UNSPLASH

Once a year, I have the privilege of stepping back to spend time with some of the world’s smartest, most forward-thinking business leaders.

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch to sharks.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/dileeprao/2024/09/18/the-unicorn-strategy-6-key-tactics-from-fawn-weaver-of-uncle-nearest/,"Fawn Weaver of Uncle Nearest. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

Since 2017, Fawn Weaver has built Uncle Nearest into a unicorn worth about $1.1 billion, all without relying on venture capital (VC). She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch or plead for funds.

The Background.

Weaver grew up in Los Angeles where, after a few challenges, she and her husband succeeded in real estate. For her 40th birthday, they visited Tennessee where ex-slave Nearest Green had lived and developed the formula for Jack Daniels whisky. Fascinated by his contributions, Weaver decided to honor Green’s achievements by founding her own whisky company. Today, her company, Uncle Nearest, is one of the largest African American-owned spirits brands in the U.S. Here are 6 keys to Weaver’s success.

#1. Find a high-potential opportunity.

Billion-dollar entrepreneurs, from Sam Walton to Travis Kalanick, found their unicorn-opportunity at the intersection of skills and emerging trends. Weaver found hers at the intersection of potential and passion. After reading about Nearest Green, the former slave who developed the Jack Daniels whisky formula, she felt compelled to honor his unsung accomplishment. With the profits from her successful real estate business, she and her husband founded Uncle Nearest in Tennessee’s whisky country near the Jack Daniels distillery.

#2. Develop a unicorn-building strategy.

Considering all the celebrity-based spirits companies that have been sold for huge valuations, including George Clooney’s Casamigos and Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation, it is easy to assume that building a liquor company is easy. However, this assumption is not true. Weaver succeeded by developing a smart, focused strategy:

· Weaver developed an award-winning whisky based on Nearest Green’s charcoal filtration method and won over 1,000 awards to become the “fastest-growing American whisky.”

· Weaver initially focused on Oregon where the state controls alcohol distribution, which gives small distillers like Uncle Nearest better visibility, and reduces the edge typically held by larger spirits companies.

· She followed up her initial market entry by acquiring spirits that were in high demand among African Americans.

· She promoted her liquor company by developing a unique distillery experience that included an amusement park designed to attract tourists and boost direct-to-consumer sales.

#3. Find entrepreneur-smart capital.

To avoid losing control to VCs, Weaver raised capital from 163 investors while ensuring that she and her husband retained 40% ownership of the company and 80% of the voting rights. This allowed her to control her growth and not have to dance to the VC tune. Additionally, she leveraged her equity with bank loans and focused on growth with cash flow and less capital-at-risk – an essential strategy used by more than 90% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs.

#4. Takeoff with a finance-smart strategy – to avoid VC.

Liquor companies typically enjoy high gross margins, in excess of 50%. Weaver capitalized on this by transforming her Shelbyville (TN) location into a tourist destination. This not only attracted a record number of visitors, but also encouraged them to buy premium whisky directly from the company, further boosting margins. This finance-smart approach allowed her to scale without relying on VC.

#5. Keep control.

Michigan will show a new look after a shaky start to the post-Jim Harbaugh era when it hosts a red-hot USC on Saturday afternoon. If you can wrap your mind around a California team playing in a Big Ten game on CBS, you can handle anything including making a winning bet in the biggest game of the weekend.

USC is a 5.5-point road favorite on DraftKings Sportsbook with -218 money line odds, making Michigan a +180 underdog. The over/under set at 46.5.

First-year head coach Sherrone Moore announced redshirt sophomore quarterback Alex Orji will make his starting debut after losing the offseason battle to Davis Warren, who was replaced after his third interception in last week’s win over Arkansas State.

On the other side, USC quarterback Miller Moss is a top-10 Heisman Trophy candidate through his first two games of Year 1 as a starter. He introduced himself to the college football world with a 378-yard performance in a season-opening win over LSU over Labor Day weekend.

Michigan failed to cover in its first three games, and nobody is impressed with what it’s shown this season, especially after its Week 2 issues at Texas. USC is 2-0 against the spread after beating LSU and dominating backup QB led 48-0 in Week 2.

It’s tempting to buy low on the defending champs at home, but USC received extra time to prepare for its toughest road test it will get all season. Instead of siding with either of these teams, let’s go with the under 46.5.

Here’s why:

According to Pro Football Focus, Alex Orji has taken 53 snaps at quarterback over the last three seasons with only seven career pass attempts. That means 13.2% of his QB snaps have resulted in Orji throwing the ball. With a sample size of 29 snaps this season, Orji attempted a pass six times for a 20.7% rate.

Needless to say, the coaching staff is showing Orji’s biggest strength comes in the running game without a ton of confidence in him putting the ball in the air. This will keep the clock moving and shorten this game with minimal pass attempts.

The biggest danger to the total is on the other side of the ball, but Moss’ fast start is somewhat misleading. He shined in front of a huge viewing audience in the season opener, but that came against an LSU defense that struggles against the pass. The Tigers rank 118th in yards per pass attempt this season and if three games is not enough of a sample size to convince you, they were No. 111 in that category in 2023.

Michigan has the best cornerback in the country with Will Johnson, who’s expected to be one of the top picks in the 2025 NFL Draft. The defense will be up for the challenge at home in a game it needs to win, not just for its Big Ten and College Football Playoff hopes but for the first big win of the Sherrone Moore era."

She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch to sharks.,http://www.forbes.com/sites/dileeprao/2024/09/18/the-unicorn-strategy-6-key-tactics-from-fawn-weaver-of-uncle-nearest/,"Fawn Weaver of Uncle Nearest. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

Since 2017, Fawn Weaver has built Uncle Nearest into a unicorn worth about $1.1 billion, all without relying on venture capital (VC). She now has financiers knocking on her door – without having to pitch or plead for funds.

The Background.

Weaver grew up in Los Angeles where, after a few challenges, she and her husband succeeded in real estate. For her 40th birthday, they visited Tennessee where ex-slave Nearest Green had lived and developed the formula for Jack Daniels whisky. Fascinated by his contributions, Weaver decided to honor Green’s achievements by founding her own whisky company. Today, her company, Uncle Nearest, is one of the largest African American-owned spirits brands in the U.S. Here are 6 keys to Weaver’s success.

#1. Find a high-potential opportunity.

Billion-dollar entrepreneurs, from Sam Walton to Travis Kalanick, found their unicorn-opportunity at the intersection of skills and emerging trends. Weaver found hers at the intersection of potential and passion. After reading about Nearest Green, the former slave who developed the Jack Daniels whisky formula, she felt compelled to honor his unsung accomplishment. With the profits from her successful real estate business, she and her husband founded Uncle Nearest in Tennessee’s whisky country near the Jack Daniels distillery.

#2. Develop a unicorn-building strategy.

Considering all the celebrity-based spirits companies that have been sold for huge valuations, including George Clooney’s Casamigos and Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation, it is easy to assume that building a liquor company is easy. However, this assumption is not true. Weaver succeeded by developing a smart, focused strategy:

· Weaver developed an award-winning whisky based on Nearest Green’s charcoal filtration method and won over 1,000 awards to become the “fastest-growing American whisky.”

· Weaver initially focused on Oregon where the state controls alcohol distribution, which gives small distillers like Uncle Nearest better visibility, and reduces the edge typically held by larger spirits companies.

· She followed up her initial market entry by acquiring spirits that were in high demand among African Americans.

· She promoted her liquor company by developing a unique distillery experience that included an amusement park designed to attract tourists and boost direct-to-consumer sales.

#3. Find entrepreneur-smart capital.

To avoid losing control to VCs, Weaver raised capital from 163 investors while ensuring that she and her husband retained 40% ownership of the company and 80% of the voting rights. This allowed her to control her growth and not have to dance to the VC tune. Additionally, she leveraged her equity with bank loans and focused on growth with cash flow and less capital-at-risk – an essential strategy used by more than 90% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs.

#4. Takeoff with a finance-smart strategy – to avoid VC.

Liquor companies typically enjoy high gross margins, in excess of 50%. Weaver capitalized on this by transforming her Shelbyville (TN) location into a tourist destination. This not only attracted a record number of visitors, but also encouraged them to buy premium whisky directly from the company, further boosting margins. This finance-smart approach allowed her to scale without relying on VC.

#5. Keep control.

By avoiding institutional investors and instead raising funds from a large pool of angel investors, Weaver kept control of the venture and the wealth it created.

#6. Get unicorn skills.

Weaver hired distilling experts in Tennessee, including descendants of Nearest Green, to develop her award-winning product. She combined this expertise with the marketing and management skills she honed when building her real estate business in Los Angeles.

A Federal Reserve policy ... [+]

AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

With the Federal Reserve finally cutting the Federal Funds Rate by 0.50% during its September 18th meeting, interest rates on credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and other types of borrowing should be on their way down. But most types of student loans won't see any impact based on rate cuts — at least not through the end of the year and into next year.

If you have student loan debt from the last few years, you may be wondering if rate cuts from the Fed will impact your personal interest rate, your monthly payment, and the other details of your loan. You may also be wondering if there are steps you can take now to secure a lower rate for your existing debt, including refinancing your loans with a private lender.

How Fed Rate Cuts Impact Federal Student Loans

Rate cuts from the Fed don't move the needle on federal student loan rates for existing loans at all. Certified Student Loan Professional (CSLP) Glenn Sanger-Hodgson of Shonan Gold Financial LLC says this is because federal student loan rates change just once each year on July 1st. The rates set for the year remain in place until June 30th of the following year, when they are adjusted again.

Federal student loan rates are also fixed, meaning any loans disbursed during this period have the same interest rate for the life of the loan. This means changes to interest rates that take place during repayment don't impact loans that have already been disbursed. Since interest rates on federal student loans can't change until July 1st of next year, any future changes will be for new loans disbursed after that date until June 30th of the following year.

Unfortunately, this all means individuals who took out federal student loans in the last year (or any time in the past) are stuck paying the rates they have, for better or for worse.

This isn't great news for those who will or have had loans disbursed after July 1st 2024, when the the interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergrads is 6.53% and the rate for Direct Unsubsidized loans for graduate or professional students is 8.08%.

Fed Rate Cuts And Private Student Loans

Sanger-Hodgson says that those with private student loans, especially variable interest rate loans, are more likely to feel the effect of changes in the federal funds rate. Much like federal student loans, interest rates on private student loans are set based on a benchmark — typically the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus some margin based off of the borrower's creditworthiness. However, private student loan rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions versus federal student loan rates that change once per year.

This means borrowers with private student loans could see their variable rates drop based on Federal Reserve rate cuts. It also means those shopping for private student loans or looking to a private company to refinance their student loans may find more competitive rates now than last year.

Should You Refinance Student Loans?

With interest rates on private student loans potentially on their way down, it's easy to wonder if you could benefit from refinancing. And if you're still in college and comparing your loan options, private student loans may seem more attractive than federal loans as rates continue to drop.

Amanda Elliott, who serves as Associate Director of Financial Aid and Student Finance Advising at Colorado State University Global says that variable-rate private loans for current students may stand out at the moment due to their very low introductory rates after a Fed rate cut.

""This could provide short-term savings on interest,"" she said.

If you have private student loans with a high interest rate, refinancing could help you lock in a lower rate, especially if rates continue to fall due to future Fed rate cuts.

""This can reduce your monthly payments and the total interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.,"" said Elliott.

Still, you'll want to be careful of refinancing federal student loans with a private lender — even if lower rates on private loans make this move seem like a no-brainer. This is because federal student loans come with protections private student loans simply do not, including federal deferment and forbearance options, access to income-driven repayment plans, and access to existing loan forgiveness plans like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). And if broad student loan forgiveness is able to pass in the future, it would likely apply only to federal student loans.

These are some of the reasons people tend to treat federal student loan debt differently than other types of debt, and why Sanger-Hodgson says you should think over the pros and cons and what your goals are first.

""If you need access to income-driven repayment options, then sticking with your federal student loans may be the best option, even if it means having loans with a higher interest rate,"" he says. ""And borrowers who are pursuing forgiveness may be better served staying with federal student loans, especially if the effective interest rate on their forgiven loans is lower than rates available through private refinancing.

The Bottom Line

Will the latest Federal Reserve rate cut impact your student loans? As you can tell from the information I just shared, the answer is ""it depends.""

Federal student loan rates will remain unchanged until at least July 1st of next year, whereas the impact on private student loans will be more immediate. Even so, nobody knows how low rates will fall on private student loans, nor do they know when rates will hit their next floor."

Pros:

CertiPUR-US Certified and Greenguard Gold Certified
Specific support for side sleepers
Assembled in the USA

Cons:

Only one firmness option

The Helix Midnight twin mattress proves that great things really do come in small packages. The brand notes that the hybrid design is made with side sleepers in mind, as well as those who frequently toss and turn at night, but we find it accommodating for most sleeping positions; especially those who weigh under 150 pounds. Sitting atop supportive coils with reinforced edges are two layers of foam. The first contoured foam layer is tailored to contour to the shape of your body, while the top memory foam is for pressure relief. You can also sleep easy knowing that every mattress is made with CertiPUR-US certified and Greenguard Gold certified materials and assembled in the USA. Since it comes with a 100-night trial, you can be sure you love it before committing. If you prefer a softer or firmer pick, Helix offers several other mattresses in the core collection that range in firmness and support levels. 

What the reviews say: ""[I] absolutely enjoy the Helix Midnight mattress,"" says a five-star review. ""Not having shoulder or hip pain throughout the night is the way sleep should be—restful. Also, I like not having to wrestle out of the imprint as with foam mattresses. I can turn over with minimal effort."" Another customer says, ""After one night of sleep, I noticed a huge difference in my ability to fall asleep, comfort, and sleeping position. I’ve had the mattress for a little over a month now and miss it when I go on vacation and use another product.""

Pros:

Ideal for back, stomach and combination sleepers
Budget-friendly
Cooling cover

Cons:

Only one firmness level that may be too firm for side sleepers

The Nectar Classic Memory Foam Mattress is an accommodating, budget-friendly memory foam option with a medium-firm level of firmness that has wide appeal to back, stomach and combination sleepers. The cover is made with a moisture-wicking, breathable material that makes the surface feel physically cool. The cover also has an antimicrobial treatment to fight bacteria. Below that are several layers of foam that provide pressure relief, support and stability. Plus, the foam offers excellent motion isolation and pressure relief. All in all, it’s a mattress we don’t think you can go wrong with if you like a contouring, slightly doughy feel. But on the off chance you get it and find it isn’t quite right, the company also offers a longer-than-average trial and return period, giving you a full year to use it from the comfort of your own home before you’re locked in.

What the reviews say: ""Nectar is so comfortable,"" says a customer. ""The memory foam is both soft and supportive. Sleeping on it has helped [greatly reduced my] back soreness."" A repeat customer adds, ""So delighted with the comfort of this memory foam mattress. [It’s] the first memory foam mattress I’ve ever had, and I’m loving it. Nine months later, I bought a second mattress for my guest room. [I] love them. So very comfortable.""

Pros:

Excellent motion isolation with responsive memory foam
Ideal for most sleeping positions
Budget-friendly

Cons:

May not be supportive enough for heavier sleepers

The Leesa Studio Mattress is a stellar option for anyone looking to spend less money on their mattress without compromising on quality. The bed is made from three layers of foam—an uppermost memory foam layer, a central comfort layer with air capsules for cooling and finally a base stability layer. Combined, they offer a medium firm feel that the company ranks as a 5-7 on a firmness scale out of 10. It’s a little softer than the Nectar Mattress, making it a good fit for most sleeping positions and those looking for a little extra give. Though, since it isn’t made with coils, it’s ideal for those who weigh under 250 pounds or as a guest room bed. The mattress also has CertiPUR-US foam and a Greenguard Gold certification, which demonstrate that the materials are high quality and free of toxic chemicals. With sale prices dipping under $450 for a twin, the cost and quality is tough to beat.

What the reviews say: “I recommend this bed to everyone. It’s impossible to find this type of comfort for the price. This is my third Leesa bed and they’ve all held up extremely well.” writes one reviewer. Another says, “Easily the comfiest mattress I’ve slept on. Only problem is that it’s becoming hard to get up in the morning because I'm so comfy. Thank you, Leesa, for an affordable luxury mattress.""

Pros:

Low profile makes it a great option for smaller sleepers

Cons:

Some reviewers mention a strong latex odor that takes a while to dissipate

This mattress tops our list of the best kids mattresses because it meets a robust list of third-party safety standards. It’s both Greenguard Gold and Made Safe certified, as it uses organic cotton and wool. With just 7 inches in height, it works well on different types of children’s beds, like bunk beds and trundle beds. It’s free from synthetic foam and fiberglass. Rose Gordon Sala, who oversees baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted, got this mattress for her son who has asthma and allergies. “Mostly I just feel great about him sleeping on this ultra clean mattress as he grows,” she says.

What the reviews say: One parent, who says they bought these mattresses when their children turned three, writes, “I am impressed enough to consider buying one for myself when we need a new mattress.” Another says, “We absolutely love our mattress for our son. Not only is it super comfortable we feel really good about the materials he sleeps on every night. Highly recommend.”

Pros:

Multiple firmness levels to suit a wide range of sleepers
Ideal for all body types
Optional cooling cover upgrade

Cons:

Returns cost $99

The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid strikes a great balance between cushy comfort and ample support, thanks to the 1.5-inch quilted top, two layers of foam and a stable coil base. The coils are designed for edge support, contouring and motion isolation, while the foam provides deep compression support and quickly responds whenever you move. The mattress offers great support for all sleep positions with multiple firmness levels that appeal to almost any sleeper (which is one of the reasons we love it). Our editors also crown it a top-favorite because it’s one of the most affordable mattresses you can get for the money, as quality hybrid mattresses can be fairly pricey. See more in our Brooklyn Bedding Signature Mattress review. 

What the reviews say: ""The hybrid has just the right amount of firmness our tired backs needed,"" says a five-star review. ""The ultimate combination of the springs with just enough [of the] foam gel layer to give us the best night’s sleep."" A repeat customer writes, ""This is my second Brooklyn Signature Hybrid, and I have loved it. It’s the perfect combination of support and softness for sleeping.""

Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Soft, luxury firm or firm | Trial: 365 nights (one year) | Warranty: Lifetime warranty

Pros:

Choice of firmness and height
Excellent support throughout, including around the perimeter
Dual-coil design makes it ultra-supportive (for all body types)

Cons:

Premium materials and construction make it a heavy mattress
Returns cost $99

The Saatva Classic Mattress isn’t like most mattresses you order online. It comes with white glove delivery, even for a twin size. The design of the mattress itself also allows for far better edge support than many other beds you can order online. The mattress’s edges are surrounded with “high density foam rails,” which make the sides of it firmer and more stable. You can rest assured that with a Saatva mattress, sleeping near the edge won’t mean nearly falling off the bed. Given the smaller size of twin mattresses, we think it’s a great feature to keep in mind when shopping for one. The mattress is also great at cooling, as its spring base permits ample airflow. Plus, it comes in three different firmness levels, so you can choose what’s best for your sleep preferences. Read more in our full Saatva Classic review

What the reviews say: One reviewer, who says he’s had his mattress for a year and a half, writes, “the mattress still feels like new. I’m a heavy guy around 250 pounds and there are no dips, nice firm sides.” Another says, “I love the stability I feel when I am lying on it. The coils and added memory form are a bonus, as well as the outstanding edge support.”

Pros:

Ideal for side and combination sleepers
Cool touch cover and cooling cloud foam
Perfectly plush for sleepers under 150 pounds

Cons:

Only one firmness option
Might be too soft for stomach sleepers

If you want cloud-like comfort in every sleeping position, the Puffy Cloud Mattress is a top choice. While the brand rates it around a medium firm, in our Puffy Cloud mattress review our tester found its profile is around a medium to medium-soft, with a cushy, pillowy feel. That means it’s a little too soft for back sleepers, but ideal for petite bodies under 150 pounds, side sleepers and combination sleepers. It’s designed with six layers that work together to support the body, keep your spine properly aligned and cradle the muscles and joints. Combination sleepers will appreciate the ease of movement offered by the responsive memory foam layers as they move from one position to another. While foam is known to retain heat, this mattress combats that with cooling cloud foam and a cool touch cover. 

What the reviews say: ""The mattress slept like a dream,"" raves a customer. ""I was never hot, and it provides firm support while contouring to our bodies. We are able to roll over without getting stuck in the bed."" Another customer says, ""Our old mattress transferred so much motion that anytime [my husband] moved, I woke up. This one, I can barely feel him even tossing and turning (he’s not a little fella either, so that’s saying a lot). We love the silence and lack of spring sounds. Laying on the mattress feels like you are laying on a marshmallow—it’s just so cloud-like.""

Type: Memory foam | Firmness: Extra firm or firm | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: 10 years

Pros:

Flippable design
Great price point

Cons:

Somewhat lacking in edge support

This mattress tops our list of the best extra-firm mattresses, thanks in part to its flippable design that offers two firm profiles in one mattress. This design gives you the option to flip the mattress and choose between two firmness levels—one side is firm and the other side is extra-firm. You might be surprised to learn that the Plank mattress from Brooklyn Bedding is not a hybrid with springs, but instead uses two types of high-density foam to create its firm support structure. For those who sleep hot, you can add an optional cooling cover. If you weigh over 250 pounds, opt for the Plank Luxe, which is built with more supportive pocketed coils. 

What the reviews say: One 5-star reviewer writes, “If you’re interested in a firm mattress, this is it.” Another says, “[I] did not feel the traditional mattress I had was firm enough for my adjustable bed, so I replaced it with a Twin XL Plank firm. Very happy I did. It feels solid no matter what position the bed is in. Finally I'm sleeping in comfort.”

Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-firm | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime

Pros:

Organic and eco-friendly materials
Temperature regulating and pressure relieving

Cons:

There’s only one choice of firmness

The Nolah Natural is an eco-friendly hybrid that combines layers of organic cotton and wool with Talalay latex and a zoned coil system, making it suitable for kids or adults looking for a twin mattress. It gives the mattress buoyant support and excellent pressure relief comparable to memory foam. But latex doesn’t retain heat the way memory foam can, making this a good option for adults prone to overheating. The zoned coils also ensure extra support in high-pressure spots to promote proper alignment and just enough give around the hips and shoulders.

What the reviews say: “[It’s] a very comfortable mattress,” writes one reviewer. “I find that I fall asleep faster, sleep deeper and wake up less during the night.” Another says, “This mattress has changed my sleep for the better. It's just right, super comfortable, has a little give and the springs give it some firmness without making the mattress hard as a rock.”

I had years of experience testing and writing about mattresses to reference when I selected picks for this list. I see through mattress companies’ jargon, to look at what’s actually beneath the covers, as it were.
All of the mattresses on our list come from well-known and reputable brands within the sleep community.
For this story, we selected mattresses that Forbes staffers have slept on and loved or currently own and swear by. I’ve personally slept on and enjoyed several of the products on this list. The ones our team hasn’t tried were picked based on their rave customer reviews, quality materials and good brand reputation.
We incorporated Costigan’s expert advice on shopping for a new twin mattress.
When narrowing down the list of mattresses, we extensively evaluated a variety of features, including the type of mattress, firmness and size options. All the companies on this list have at-home trials because it’s hard to know if you’ll like a mattress without actually sleeping on it for yourself.
In addition to reading hundreds of customer reviews, we only chose products with a four-star rating or higher.

What To Consider When Shopping For The Best Twin Mattress

Choosing the best twin mattress really isn’t any different than choosing a queen or king. The right twin mattress meets individual needs and preferences, so it’s important to understand the role of specific features and materials. Here’s what to keep in mind.

Materials

Like bigger mattresses, twin mattresses are made with a variety of materials that impart specific benefits.

Memory foam is a popular material thanks to its pressure-relieving properties and hugged sensation, which really appeals to some sleepers.
Latex foam has similar pressure-relieving benefits, but it doesn’t retain heat the way memory foam often does. Latex foam beds are, however, fairly heavy in weight.
Hybrid mattresses, which combine comfort layers made of foams or latex with a supportive innerspring layer, are another popular option. This construction promotes breathability and often has superior edge support and longevity compared to all-foam mattresses.

Firmness

Mattresses are typically generally categorized as plush, medium and firm, or somewhere in between, but keep in mind that there is no universal firmness scale. What’s more, body weight influences how soft or firm a mattress feels. Mattresses on the firmer side tend to offer a greater sense of support and the sensation that you’re on top of the mattress instead of sinking into it. Soft mattresses have a plusher, more cushioning feel.

Sleeping Position

Preferred sleeping positions can help steer you toward certain materials and firmnesses. “Think about the position you sleep in,” says Costigan. “People who are side sleepers need something different than someone who is a stomach sleeper.” Back and stomach sleepers benefit from mattresses that are medium-firm to firm, which will ensure a neutral spine. Side sleepers do best on medium to soft beds with a little more cushioning around the hips and shoulders to keep pressure from building.

Body Type

People with bigger frames and more weight will sink into the top comfort layers of a mattress more deeply, which can affect how firm it feels. Firmer mattresses, and those designed with higher-density foams, may offer the most comfort and support. Slight and lightweight sleepers, on the other hand, tend to remain on the very surface of a mattress and benefit from something a little plusher.

Price

Another benefit of twin mattresses is that they're generally less expensive than queen or king-size beds. However, certain materials and upgraded features can make some models more costly than others. For instance, even amongst latex mattresses you'll find a cost difference compared to memory foam beds. Organic latex is made from the rubber sap of trees, which some people appreciate for its sustainability. But, it tends to be more expensive due to the lengthy process. If you're concerned about price, the budget-friendly Leesa Studio is made with synthetic latex and designed to mimic the properties of organic latex.

Trial And Warranty

When it comes to buying mattresses, especially online when you can't feel them beforehand, trials and warranties are a must. Every mattress on our list has a minimum trial of 90 nights and a warranty of at least 10 years. Costigan notes the importance of a trial saying, “There’s a trial period for most mattress because it requires some time to figure out what you like. It may seem like a hassle but presumably you’ll be sleeping on this mattress for years, so you want to gather some info to see if it works for you.”

importance of mindset in financial health,forbes,What The Fed’s Rate Cut Means For Bitcoin,"Today's aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.",http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/09/18/what-the-feds-rate-cut-means-for-bitcoin/,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

GETTY IMAGES

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points today (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. For bitcoin, a unique asset often heralded as a hedge against central bank mismanagement, this decision introduces both opportunities and possible near-term risks.

A Signal of Economic Trouble?

The Fed’s decision to cut by 50 bps represents more than just monetary policy adjustment – it’s a clear acknowledgment that the economy is struggling more than policymakers have publicly let on. After a year of aggressive tightening aimed at taming inflation, this shift signals that the central bank is now in damage control mode. It reflects growing anxiety over potential recessionary forces, stagnating job growth, and the underlying structural weaknesses in the financial system.

BitcoinBitcoin -1.8% has traditionally thrived on economic uncertainty, positioning itself as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. However, today’s rate cut presents a more complex reality. While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon – a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s Short-Term Trajectory: Volatility or Opportunity?

For bitcoin, the 50 bps cut sends mixed signals. Historically, rate cuts have been positive for hard assets like bitcoin, as such cuts are inflationary, leading to capital find its way into assets that can serve as stores of value. But this rate cut doesn’t feel like a traditional monetary easing; rather, it’s a borderline emergency response to growing economic instability. If the markets interpret this cut as a sign that the U.S. economy is in deeper trouble than anticipated, bitcoin could be caught in a risk-off selloff.

In recent weeks, bitcoin has struggled to hold onto the gains it made earlier in the summer. After reaching highs of $65,000 in August, its exchange rate with the dollar slipped under $59,000, reflecting broader market uncertainty and concerns about the Fed’s next move. With today’s 50 bps cut, bitcoin could face even more turbulence in the coming weeks as investors reassess the state of the economy.

Deeper Macro Issues: Recession Fears Intensify

Today’s rate cut comes against a backdrop of growing macroeconomic instability. The U.S. labor market, which had been resilient in 2022, is showing signs of strain. Last week’s jobs report revealed troubling data, with the U.S. economy creating fewer jobs than expected and a notable rise in unemployment to 7.1 million. This weakness, coupled with sluggish consumer spending and declining industrial output, paints a picture of an economy that may be slipping into a recession.

Globally, the picture is equally concerning. Europe remains mired in stagnation, with the Eurozone posting lackluster GDP growth of just 0.2% last quarter. In Japan, the central bank faces mounting inflationary pressures while attempting to unwind decades of ultra-loose monetary policy. Meanwhile, China’s economy continues to falter, with a slowdown in factory output, consumption, and rising unemployment threatening its once-robust growth engine.

The Fed’s 50 bps cut, therefore, isn’t just about managing U.S. economic risks; it’s about responding to a global slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for all asset markets. For bitcoin, this means navigating a highly volatile environment where macroeconomic forces exert influence on price movements that is difficult to predict.

Bitcoin’s Role in a Shifting Global Financial Landscape

Despite the short-term volatility that this aggressive rate cut may introduce, the long-term case for bitcoin remains strong. As central banks around the world grapple with economic weakness, their collective response is to increase the supply of money. Whether through rate cuts, quantitative easing, or other forms of liquidity injections, the financial system is increasingly reliant on monetary expansion to maintain even modest growth. In such an environment, bitcoin will continue to be valued as a global financial network independent of any single jurisdiction or central bank policy.

In the long run, this wave of monetary easing will likely reinforce bitcoin’s appeal to those seeking refuge from fiat debasement. However, in the short term, the price of bitcoin may be subject to increased volatility, particularly as the market digests the implications of today’s 50 bps cut.

Short-Term Turbulence, Long-Term Strength

The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of global economic instability. For bitcoin, this could mean a turbulent few months ahead as markets react to the potential for a deeper economic downturn. However, as central banks resort to repeated monetary intervention, bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to strengthen.

In a world where fiat-based economies face ever-growing pressure from mismanagement and politicization, bitcoin continues to offer a compelling alternative. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but those with conviction in bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, sound money system will see today’s rate cut as another step toward validating its long-term value."

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

Dyson’s TP07 is unlike other fans on the market thanks to its unique shape and technology. The TP07 uses intelligent sensing to detect and react to your air quality, delivering crisp air in the process. The machine syncs up with the MyDyson app so you can control the action from anywhere. The TP07 uses two stages of purification to capture 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns or larger and keep them there, so you don’t have to stress about your purifier shooting pet dander back out. While this air purifier can double as a fan, it also has a backwards airflow mode to give you clean air without a breeze.

Why Trust Forbes Vetted

The members of Forbes Vetted’s home and kitchen team are experts in the field, spending countless hours researching, testing and writing about the latest residential products.

Our vast library of home and kitchen stories includes extensive coverage on air purifiers, including our main story on the best air purifiers, the best air purifiers for smoke and the best air purifiers for allergies.
This story was written by lifestyle contributor Korin Miller and is overseen by Forbes Vetted’s team of experienced home and kitchen editors.
To ensure we had the best sense of what to look for in an air purifier for pets, we consulted with two medical experts with specialties in allergy and asthma: Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network; and Evan Li, M.D., assistant professor of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at Baylor College of Medicine.
We regularly review our selection of the best air purifiers for pets to make sure it is as up to date as possible. This story was last updated in September 2024.

How We Chose The Best Air Purifiers For Pets

To choose the best air purifiers for pets, we focused on the top devices from trusted brands such as Levoit, Bissell, Coway and Honeywell.

We sifted through customer reviews, ensuring each pick had mostly positive feedback (particularly accounting for reviews from pet owners) and an average rating of four stars or more.
We consulted two medical experts with a focus on allergy and immunology to get their input on the most important characteristics to focus on.
Each product was analyzed for features like efficiency, coverage area, design, filtering performance and value. In making the final selections, we kept various lifestyles and budgets in mind.

What To Look For In A Pet Air Purifier

A quality pet air purifier can pull dander and other allergens out of your air, as well as telltale odors that come with pet ownership. When picking out an air purifier for pets, consider these key factors.

Filtration

The goal of an air purifier for pets is to pull pet dander and other allergens out of your home’s air. While many machines can do this, each has its own filtration system and number of filters. HEPA filters are considered the gold standard, given that they can trap very small particles. If pet odors is a big concern, look for a purifier with a charcoal filter—these tamp down on smells by trapping odor-causing particles within the filter. Some purifiers will also have a pre-filter, which is helpful for removing larger items like pet hair from your air.

Fan Speed

Most air purifiers have more than one fan speed, but some have three or more options to flip through. If you tend to deal with intense odors or air quality issues after, say, cooking steak or having a wet dog troop through your home, a turbo fan speed can be helpful to clean your air fast. Many people who sleep with an air purifier running also appreciate having a purifier with a sleep mode, which is typically quiet. Most people toggle through two or so speeds, but some prefer more.

Portability

Air purifiers for pets come in a wide selection of sizes. Petite models are usually simple to transfer between rooms, but larger machines can pose more of a challenge. If you decide to invest in a sizable machine and plan to use it in multiple rooms, look for features like wheels or a handle to make the process of moving it around easier on you. If you’re planning to have a purifier stay in one room, though, portability is less of an issue.

Additional Features

Some air purifiers for pets have extra features to make your air filtration experience even easier. Certain machines come with remotes, allowing you to adjust settings from across the room, and some have apps, so you can make changes from practically anywhere. A turbo boost setting, which allows the purifier to quickly spring into action, is also helpful. If you prefer a more hands-off air purifier experience, consider a machine with sensors to detect the quality of your air and respond accordingly.

UNSPLASH

Once a year, I have the privilege of stepping back to spend time with some of the world’s smartest, most forward-thinking business leaders.

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

The stock market has been beating back worries about an imminent recession. The Fed still has rate cuts up its sleeve. On the ground, unemployment is still at historic lows. In most but not all sectors, businesses are doing quite well. And, whether for better or worse, home values and prices continue to climb.

In order to discern the strength of state economies, economic data was analyzed, sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on real GDP in chained 2017 dollars, used to provide a true picture of economic growth as opposed to using nominal GDP figures, which don’t account for inflation. Read on to find out the strength of the economy in terms of states by GDP and see which are the fastest growing states in terms of GDP growth over the years.

States by GDP Growth: The Biggest Growth Over 5 Years

Examining the change in quarterly real GDP by state, the state that has the experienced the most significant five-year growth is Idaho. From the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2024, Idaho’s real GDP grew by 23.3%, from $79.57 billion to $98.12 billion, respectively (in chained 2017 dollars).

But that’s looking at quarter-to-quarter over five years. What about annual real GDP growth from, say, 2018 to 2023 (since 2024 isn’t over, there’s no annual GDP). By this standard, Idaho is still No. 1, growing 22.2% to No. 2 Florida’s 21.8%, and No. 3 Utah’s 20.4%. Idaho’s real GDP grew from $77.65 billion in 2018 to $94.91 billion in 2023. 2023, from $1.08 trillion to $1.28 trillion. And this is in chained 2017 dollars, which means it accounts for inflation. Regular GDP growth, unadjusted, was 40.5%, from $84.55 billion in 2019 to $118.79 trillion in 2023.

Below is a table of states by GDP ranked by greatest five-year growth, from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024:

The percent change in real GDP from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024, Idaho’s grew by 5%, which is the highest quarter-over-quarter rate out of all 50 states. What’s most revealing though is that the biggest contributing industry to this 5% growth was real estate and rental and leasing; this industry contributed 0.97 percentage points to that 5%. Initially, much of Idaho’s explosive real estate markets was due to the pandemic-induced remote work policies, with many flocking to the state for relocation. Yet, this boom is still going.

Florida’s 22.8% real GDP growth from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024 is second to only Idaho. Florida is also second to Idaho only in terms of its annual GDP growth over the last five years, 21.8%. Like Idaho, real estate and rental and leasing was the biggest contributing industry, responsible for 0.49 percentage points of Florida’s 3% growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.

Arizona too has put up fantastic numbers. In in terms of real GDP, Arizona’s grew from $366.27 billion in Q1 2019 to $423.94 billion by Q1 2024. That’s growth of 20.2% over five years. In terms of annual real GDP, the five-year growth of 19.6%. Not coincidentally, it is once again the real estate industry that’s responsible for the greatest growth, contributing 0.76 percentage points to 3.2% of growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. The retail trade industry contributed 0.61 percentage points.

Cult Mia’s rigorous designer selection process ensures that every featured brand meets high standards for quality, exclusivity, and social impact. Out of approximately 275 designers who apply each month, only 10% are accepted. Briance and her team have implemented a sourcing strategy prioritizing ethical, transparent, and responsible practices. “We have a clear baseline for brands joining our platform.

Cult Mia offers over 55,000 products from 350 brands spanning 42 countries, with more than 40% of these brands exclusive to the platform.

Briance’s journey from finance to fashion highlights a lifelong passion for fashion, which initially played a secondary role in her career. After starting her career in finance and working at the U.N. and Moda Operandi, Briance pursued an MBA at London Business School, where she turned her love for fashion into a career. Her entrepreneurial spirit was evident even during her time at Stanford University, where she founded a food delivery service connecting local restaurants to college students. Though that venture didn’t scale, it fueled her ambition to build a business. To gain expertise in the consumer space, Briance spent time in investment banking at UBS and private banking at Goldman Sachs. During this period, she observed that many talented fashion designers lacked the commercial and financial knowledge necessary to scale their brands, which inspired her to fill this gap. “I had the opportunity to work in sales and strategy at Moda Operandi and noticed the luxury fashion ecosystem was becoming consolidated, with the same designers sold across all platforms. Customers were looking for unique brands to complement their Chanel pieces. Suddenly, the cool woman wasn’t dressed head-to-toe in a single designer but was mixing established and unknown brands. After my time at Moda, I joined the London Business School’s Accelerator Program, and Cult Mia became the winning business in 2019. That experience gave me the confidence to pursue Cult Mia further. The incubator lasted 12 months and provided a structured way to scale the business. Launching just before COVID presented a huge opportunity to onboard a wide range of brands looking for new sales channels when their physical stores closed,” Briance recalls.

As a female founder, one of Briance’s most significant challenges—and proudest triumphs—was raising Cult Mia’s seed round while pregnant. As the sole founder, she couldn’t delegate responsibilities, making the experience even more demanding. Juggling personal and professional challenges without the option for maternity leave was one of the toughest periods of her life. Reflecting on this experience, Briance stresses the importance of strong professional and personal support networks. She credits her team at Cult Mia and her family for helping her through that time. “It takes an army,” she acknowledges, noting the unique challenges of being a female founder.

Briance attributes her lifelong curiosity, nurtured from childhood, as a major influence on her life and career. Growing up in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S., and speaking multiple languages, she developed a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and perspectives. This curiosity sparked her love for travel and learning, shaping her vision for Cult Mia. It drives her to embrace diversity, celebrate unique voices in fashion, and continuously push the boundaries of industry norms. For Briance, Cult Mia is more than fashion—it’s about telling stories that connect people across cultures and borders. Looking ahead, Cult Mia will launch exclusive designer capsules each month for the remainder of the year. Featured designers include Montsand, Monika Dimova, Silvia Gnecchi, and Nur Karaata. Additionally, in October, Briance will debut her podcast, “Behind the Seams,” exploring the intersection of fashion, culture, and entrepreneurship."

This past week , I spent four days in California’s wine country, huddled with an intimate group of 50 leaders of strategy and innovation, mostly from America’s largest companies. We heard fascinating presentations on everything from artificial intelligence to biomimicry to embodied cognition and how to reduce friction in our organizations. We split into smaller groups, where we were vulnerable about what was happening both professionally and personally. We learned, laughed, cried, danced … and sipped our fair share of lovely Napa wine in the evenings.

I came away from last year’s retreat with the clear sense that the next 10 years will have an outsized impact on the happiness of the human condition for the next thousand years. I know that sounds incredibly grandiose, but developments in AI, climate change and social fragmentation convinced me that this is true. The world is at a pivotal point. So I went to Napa this year with one big follow-up question: “What should we actually be doing about that?”

It turns out that the answers to that question were manifold, but I’ll share three broad themes that emerged around technology, culture and business.

Technology: Leaders Need to Develop AI Intuition

The discussions on technology were, inevitably, dominated by AI. There was consensus that no one really knows what’s going on inside these machines and where it will lead. Even top AI executives acknowledge they aren’t sure about the inner workings of large language models.

But what was clear is that the organizations getting real value out of AI today are those whose leaders are fully engaging with the technology rather than delegating it. Tinkering with ChatGPT for a few hours isn’t enough. Leaders need to spend real time with AI. Ten hours will get you a basic exposure. Twenty hours will start to reveal some helpful use cases for you. And 30 hours will start to show you patterns of where you might go from here. Of course, the technology is improving rapidly, so you have to keep going back to stay abreast of its rapidly changing capabilities.

This is counterintuitive given the conventional wisdom that senior executives should focus on the big picture and avoid getting into the weeds. But it’s not that simple: leaders need to know enough to gain intuition into how a technology will affect their business. The boss of a retail chain doesn’t need to know every SKU code on the shelves, but they should be walking their stores on a regular basis to see what’s happening on the ground. Similarly, CEOs don’t have to write code, but they need to develop a strong intuition for what AI can do, and what it can’t.

Culture: Everybody Is At The Table

After the murder of George Floyd, companies made significant commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Most of those commitments were performative. And a lot of those initiatives have fizzled out. What’s more, DEI has become a political hot button for conservatives. Not surprisingly, companies have pulled back. But something bigger is happening in society.

American culture is shifting, whether companies do anything different or not. People are demanding a seat at the table. Not just men, but women too. Not just white people, but people of color. Not just straight people, but queer folks.

I heard it over and over again from every speaker and most of the participants. Inclusivity wasn’t a separate idea. It was woven throughout the presentations and conversations.

Inclusion has moved in the culture to become a minimum standard of performance. Your product doesn’t work if it doesn’t work for everyone. That, in turn, requires a team and supplier ecosystem that reflects a diverse base of customers.

We’ve seen this kind of move to greater inclusion before. Today, no one would think of designing a building that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. Or making a kitchen stove that would let kids light the house on fire.

Take, for example, how cars are designed. For years, it was assumed that women suffer more serious injuries in car accidents because they were more physically fragile than men. In fact, it was because car safety features had been designed for men. Even the crash test dummies were taller and heavier than the average woman. To be sure, it can pay for companies to be selective about their customers—but for the right reasons, such as their tastes and values, not their gender or race.

Business: Leaders as Editor-In-Chief

Participants were in strong agreement that the role of the senior leader or CEO has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of command-and-control style bosses who lead their troops into battle like a Civil War-era general. Leaders today need to think more like the editor-in-chief of a newspaper. Anyone who’s worked with a great editor knows that their magic lies in subtracting words, not adding them, while making the narrative more concise and coherent. Leaders don’t need to edit content. They need to edit their employees’ time: eliminating systems, processes and objectives that waste resources, slow decision-making or distract from the mission.

Today, the best leaders are those who focus on curating and collaborating rather than commanding. They look for ways to streamline processes and avoid the common psychological trap of continuously adding things (meetings, software applications, roles, rules etc). They understand that different projects and problems demand different approaches rather than following the template of the latest business-school fad. If a poor decision is easily changeable, they change it fast. But they also realize that some problems demand a slower, more considered approach.

The Value of Nature

As we discussed technology, culture and leadership, something became increasingly clear: leaders need to find ways to accelerate their own and their team’s thinking. And we’re actively working against that.

My biggest takeaway was blindingly simple yet profound—get outside. I need to spend more time in the real world. And I need to spend more time in nature.

Like a lot of people, the pandemic led me to spend too much time indoors on Zoom meetings. My time interacting in person with brilliant leaders at a beautiful location made me realize how this habit is depleting my energy and probably making me think dumber thoughts. Nature doesn’t just replenish our energy—it clears the mind, making us better equipped to navigate the challenges ahead. Research indicates that being inside depletes one’s attention capacity while being in nature “fills up the tank.” One exec told me that she only makes big decisions when she’s outside—a practice that I now plan to emulate.

Spending more time in nature can also be a powerful way to explore new solutions. Biomimicry is emerging as a powerful tool for using nature to inspire products, services and even systems solutions. It’s not new. The distinctive sleek nose of Japanese bullet trains was inspired by an engineer’s bird-watching hobby. But technology is allowing ever more promising applications for copying nature. Indian startup Greenpod Labs, for example, developed a natural compound that activates the immune systems of plants, prolonging their post-harvest life. This helps to solve a food wastage problem that costs India $12 billion a year and sees it lose around 40% of its crops.

Amplifying Impact

I still believe the next 10 years will affect the human condition for the next thousand years. We have access to many answers and solutions. But we’ll need large-scale transformation to meet the moment—how can we accelerate and share those ideas?

I think Victor Cho summed it up best. Victor is the former CEO of Evite and now of AI start-up Emovid. He gave me permission for this Chatham House Rule exception. As he sees it, the next several years depend on leaders’ ability to amplify their intentions if they intend to have a big impact. There are three big vectors of amplification: AI, relationships and nature.

AI is the obvious amplifier, allowing us to do far more with fewer people and at a much lower cost. Relationships are a no less powerful amplifying force. Those relationships frayed during the pandemic but leaders should now be finding and deepening partnerships that act as a force multiplier for their business and social intentions. And it’s time for leaders to start working with nature rather than against it.

I’ll no doubt get into the weeds this week as I return to my regular life. But the world is changing. Big shifts are upon us. And it’s time to get to work.

Thank you for the honor of being chosen as this year’s Distinguished Lecturer on Regulation. I am especially happy to be back at the University of Pennsylvania, even if just virtually. I want to thank Professor Coglianese and the Penn Program on Regulation for organizing today’s event.

Not only did I grow up nearby, I was also fortunate to attend business school here at Penn. Today, my classmates, students, and other alumni are now financiers, convicted felons, and everything in between.

While here – and I was hardly alone on this point – I viewed financial regulators as clueless and often corrupt lawyers and economists. Government officials were often seen as auditioning for a future job in finance to exploit their inside knowledge to help dominant financial firms extract special favors and evade accountability for wrongdoing, even when they violate the law repeatedly.

This brings me to today’s topic: reining in repeat offenders. As always, my remarks today reflect the views of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and do not necessarily represent the views of any other part of the Federal Reserve System.

***

I want to address a vexing problem facing regulators across sectors of the economy: How do we stop large dominant firms from violating the law over and over again with seeming impunity? Corporate recidivism has become normalized and calculated as the cost of doing business; the result is a rinse-repeat cycle that dilutes legal standards and undermines the promise of the financial sector and the entire market system.

Agency and court orders are not suggestions, but many large companies see them as such. While small firms can get hit hard with penalties that threaten their viability and their operators fear imprisonment, many large institutions see the law as mere expenses on their income statements.

The special treatment applied to large financial institutions over their smaller counterparts, as well as the “too big to fail” and “too big to jail” problems, undermines the public’s confidence in the rule of law, a bedrock principle of our society. Honest players and new entrants are disadvantaged, and the whole system is corroded.

Repeat offenders take many forms. The worst type of repeat offender violates a formal court or agency order; this is especially egregious because they often consented to the terms as part of a settlement. They clearly understand the laws and provisions to adhere to but failed to comply due to dysfunction or they took a calculated risk. Another type of repeat offender is one that has multiple violations of law across different business lines, but the violations stem from a common cause. For example, I have found that violations across business lines often relate to problematic sales practice incentives or a failure to properly integrate IT systems after a large merger. In other words, the company may have dealt with some symptoms but didn’t do anything about the disease.

We must forcefully address repeat lawbreakers to alter company behavior and ensure companies realize it is cheaper, and better for their bottom line, to obey the law than to break it.

First, I want to spend my time today talking about some specific examples of big firms that have repeatedly broken the law. Second, I want to explore a case study of the Federal Trade Commission’s handling of Facebook’s repeated violations of law. And finally, I want to describe some of the steps the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators can take to halt recidivism and create a system that treats small and big firms equally.

***

There are many examples of large firms that have repeatedly broken the law but faced few meaningful consequences. This is, of course, true in the financial sector.

For those who do not know, the CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to focus on protecting consumers in the financial marketplace. Even in our relatively short existence, we have seen what other regulators have been seeing for decades: large financial institutions crossing legal fault lines over and over again. Specifically, we have taken action against:

Citigroup – 5 times;
JPMorgan Chase – 4 times;
Wells Fargo – 4 times;
American Express – 3 times; and
Discover – 3 times, one of which was a repeat violation of a previous 2015 CFPB order.

There are many more examples, but you get the point. Repeat offenses – whether it’s for the exact same offense or more malfeasance in different business lines – is par for the course for many dominant firms, including big banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and more.

The numbers are also quite large. The CFPB ordered Citibank to pay more than $1 billion in consumer redress. We ordered JPMorgan Chase to pay more than $300 million. All told, in the decade since Congress stripped the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Trade Commission, and other agencies of their authorities and transferred them to the new consumer regulator, the CFPB has already required large corporate recidivists to provide more than $3 billion in consumer redress.

Of course, small players also violate the law. But when they do, they often face punishing sanctions that fundamentally question whether they can remain viable. Dominant firms seem to know that law enforcement will not have that kind of impact on their viability, which allows them to take bigger risks that come with bigger rewards.

After the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, scores of individual bankers were convicted by the Department of Justice. Many were sent to prison. But almost no single senior executive went to jail or was truly held financially accountable for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, even as so many Americans paid a serious price when they lost their homes because they were underwater with toxic mortgages.

Some would argue that these large financial institutions have simply become too big to supervise and that is part of the problem. Government supervisors can’t keep up with the convoluted, behemoth financial products. And government lawyers are never adequately staffed to go up against corporate lawyers trained to spin wheels and run out clocks. Some litigate for years with the hope of the regulator giving up or a new, more forgiving administration coming in. The smaller companies become the low-hanging fruit with cases that are easier to quantify, qualify, and take to court. Whatever the reasons, regulators are willing to lay down the hammer on little guys but settle for press headlines with the big guys.

Often, our laws provide immediate disqualifications from certain privileges for companies found to be engaged in wrongdoing. This is particularly true when it comes to violations of criminal statutes. For example, under federal securities law, an issuer cannot enjoy the privileges of being designated as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer if they have committed certain felonies, misdemeanors, or violated various anti-fraud laws. This designation gives the largest companies a true competitive advantage over smaller companies in tapping our capital markets. However, the SEC has routinely waived this disqualification. For example, from 2006 to 2015 the SEC granted 23 such waivers to Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, JPMorgan Chase, and Royal Bank of Scotland alone. Meaningful penalties become a paper tiger when regulators are not willing to enforce them, entrenching incentives for large companies to engage in repeated misconduct.

Similarly, violating Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreements, which are deals made between the DOJ and companies to postpone prosecution on the conditions of better behaviors, have become quite common with corporate defendants. For example, JPMorgan Chase has a long history of multiple, overlapping deals with the DOJ. In 2020, the DOJ offered JPMorgan a deferred prosecution agreement for its eight years of “separate schemes” relating to trading, despite the fact that, as the DOJ acknowledged in the same press release, the company had already pled guilty to “similar misconduct involving manipulative and deceptive trading practices.”

There has been a lot of noise by government officials that big financial institutions are not “too big to jail,” but the way government has been treating them suggests otherwise. This simply raises the stakes in what we do, as government regulators, when wrongdoers are caught.

***

I now want to discuss one of the best examples of failed repeat offender enforcement: the Federal Trade Commission’s treatment of one of the largest and most well-known corporations in the world: Facebook. Facebook is a clear example of a politically powerful firm that routinely violated the terms of its government order with no real consequences.

I raise Facebook not only because it is such an egregious case but also because of the potential of very large firms entering financial services. It’s clear that Big Tech wants to get into the market, as we saw with Facebook’s failed attempt to create a new global currency. We’ve also seen Alibaba, Amazon, Google, and Tencent entering financial services, including with payments, money management, insurance, and lending. Given their size and customer reach, their entry has the potential to transform the industry. How these companies engage in other business practices is how we can expect them to engage in financial services, so it is worth going into some detail about the FTC case against one of the biggest players in this space.

In 2011, the FTC voted to issue an eight-count complaint against Facebook. According to the FTC, Facebook “deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.” The FTC simultaneously settled the matter for no money but required that Facebook cease its deceptive conduct and implement a program to ensure that privacy promises were kept. The settlement also gave the Commission broad access to company documents and personnel to ensure the company would not break the law again.

I arrived at the FTC as a Commissioner in May of 2018. The agency was in deep decay and disarray after years of lax enforcement against large corporate actors, spanning multiple administrations. In some of the most widespread recent nationwide crises, from the 2008 financial disaster to the opioid epidemic to the student loan and for-profit college scandals, the FTC was essentially missing. On a bipartisan basis, the Commission heavily relied on a “no-money, no-fault” settlement strategy, where wrongdoers essentially faced no consequences, even in cases of egregious fraud.

In the case of Facebook, though, the company was already subject to an FTC order, and violations of an order were subject to significant consequences under existing law. But for many observers, the FTC simply seemed to be watching from the sidelines as its orders were being openly flouted.

A few months prior to my arrival at the Commission, it came to light that Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, to harvest information from more than 50 million individuals and use it for political purposes. This was just one of many controversies where Facebook broke its promises to employ reasonable safeguards to keep personal information private unless the user gave explicit affirmative consent.

As a matter of credibility for the U.S. government, I thought it was essential for the FTC to enforce its own order. For years and years, though, Commissioners set up agency staff to fail. Commissioners deployed armies to small-scale scams, while depriving staff of the needed resources to police Facebook and other Big Tech firms. It was clear that these firms did not think the FTC was serious at all.

By the summer of 2019, we prepared a six-count, 50-page complaint that detailed a long list of privacy failures, including substantial order violations. That was clearly just scratching the surface of the company’s problems. But rather than investigating the matter fully or demanding significant changes to Facebook’s data harvesting practices, Commissioners pursued what many believed to be a publicity stunt.

I admit that the negotiated settlement accepted by a majority of the Commission made for a great headline. But the fine print in the settlement gave a lot for Facebook to celebrate. Facebook would pay a $5 billion fine but did not have to make any material changes to its business practices. Shockingly, Facebook was able to secure a highly unusual immunity clause for its executives, including for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg was also able to retain absolute control over the corporation; though the settlement required a so-called independent committee on privacy whose members would need to be approved by a shareholder vote; and we know Zuckerberg essentially controls a supermajority of voting rights.

Three of the commissioners held a press conference, complete with custom-made graphics, about the “record-setting” nature of the settlement. In fairness, $5 billion does sound very significant. But Facebook had become one of the most valuable corporations in the world, approaching a trillion-dollar valuation. During the press conference, a senior career official largely admitted that Commissioners agreed to forego seeking testimony and documents from Zuckerberg in exchange for a higher fine. It was clear to many that the company paid off the FTC to minimize scrutiny of its top executives’ role in the order violations.

News of the settlement quickly set off alarm bells among data protection regulators around the world. A global consensus emerged that the settlement was a sham.

In my voting statement opposing the settlement, I described how Facebook flagrantly violated the FTC’s 2012 order and how the proposed settlement did little to change the business model or practices that led to the recidivism. The settlement imposed no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to the violations. Nor did it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allowed Facebook to decide for itself how much information it could harvest from users and what it could do with that information, as long as it created a paper trail.

The proposed settlement let Facebook off the hook for unspecified violations and it gave Facebook a legal shield of unusual breadth, deviating from standard FTC practice. Indeed, when the settlement was announced against Facebook, its stock popped.

In my view, there were many lessons from the FTC’s Facebook saga:

For very large firms, seemingly large fines, even ones that are “record-setting,” may appear to be very punitive, but may have little effect;
Corporate boards will go to great lengths to shield top executives from scrutiny, even though they are all bound by agency orders; and
Committees, paperwork, compliance units, and other procedural requirements have much higher monitoring costs than bright-line structural remedies that meaningfully change business incentives.

We need to learn from these lessons to think about not only how to halt recidivism, but also how to treat small and big firms equally when it comes to enforcement actions.

***

Finally, I’ll close with how regulators should be sharpening their focus on repeat offenders and discuss some of the non-monetary, structural remedies agencies might seek in order to levy the same kind of deterrents on small and big firms alike.

Achieving general deterrence is an important goal for the CFPB. We need penalties where the expected financial benefits of an illegal scheme do not outweigh the expected costs. And we need an understanding that agency and court orders are not suggestions. Put plainly, regulators charged with overseeing large institutions have lost credibility when it comes to halting repeat offenders. While headline-driven penalties give the guise of deterrence, they do not work for dominant, powerful firms.

In the end, we need to look at bright-line structural remedies, rather than press-driven approaches. As any gardener knows, to address a weed, you need to get at the root, rather than constantly monitoring what is simply seen on the surface.

Indeed, when the CFPB helped to uncover the “fake accounts” scandal at Wells Fargo, it was not necessarily the $100 million fine on the bank that was material. Instead, it was the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to impose a growth cap that got the institution’s attention. And when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency took a role in vetting appointments of new executive hires, that also got their attention. Rather than relying solely on penalties and procedural paperwork, it is critical that regulators and enforcers shift their mindset in this way when it comes to remedies.

At the CFPB, we have plans to establish dedicated units in our supervision and enforcement divisions to enhance the detection of repeat offenses and corporate recidivists and to better hold them accountable. This will include closer scrutiny to ensure orders are being followed and closer coordination with partner agencies to ensure that each agency’s orders are not treated as suggestions. It is critical that we – regulators, enforcers, and supervisors – support each other in effectuating deterrence and compliance with orders.

But more importantly, for serial offenders of federal law, the CFPB will be looking at remedies that are more structural in nature, with lower enforcement and monitoring costs. Under our authorizing statute, the CFPB may seek “limits on the activities or functions” of a firm for violations of laws, regulations, and orders.

These are reforms that are needed throughout government. Depending on the specific facts, government enforcement agencies have an arsenal of options to truly stop the repeated illegal practices at big financial institutions. Let me run through some of the most important options. While many government regulators have sought such limitations on small businesses, they have shown less willingness to do so with larger and more powerful firms. This needs to change.

First: Caps on size or growth. When you impose asset caps, limitations on transferring or acquiring assets, or related limitations that impact the entity overall, you are curbing incentives to break the law and boosting incentives for compliance.

Second: Bans on certain types of business practices. When you put limits on business or product lines, or you close business lines or specific practices, it stops the immediate harm and stops the company from violating the law again in the future. For example, after LendUp violated a 2016 CFPB order to stop misleading customers about the benefits of its loans, we took action. We stopped LendUp from making new loans, collecting on outstanding loans to harmed customers, and selling customer information. LendUp, a former darling of venture capital, is now shutting down.

Third: Divestitures of certain product lines. Sometimes it is not a toxic product but the business model around that product or the management of the product that is the problem, in which case it makes sense to spin it off so it can operate legally. When order violations stem from a firm’s lack of managerial acumen, this is especially relevant to ensure that all subsidiaries and affiliates are obeying the law.

Fourth: Limitations on leverage or requirements to raise equity capital. When you put guardrails on how the company is fundamentally funded, it mitigates chances that a company will become over-leveraged and engage in the type of dangerous “gambling for resurrection” behavior that can harm customers and our economy. Putting these limitations on the table also serves as a powerful deterrent given financial companies’ desire to maximize their risky debt-funding and short-term return-on-equity.

Fifth: Revocation of government-granted privileges. Large firms are often required to meet certain conditions to maintain privileges authorized by the public through administrative agencies. For example, pharmaceutical companies rely on patents and sell products to government payors. Misconduct can lead to losing these benefits. Meat and poultry firms must often register with government authorities and can lose their registration if engaged in certain wrongdoing.

For repeat offenders that are insured depository institutions, they can lose access to federal deposit insurance or their ability to continue operating. For example, regulators should assess whether it is appropriate to terminate or limit access to FDIC deposit insurance or to put banks directly into receivership. Congress specified that institutions that are unsafe and unsound may be subject to losing access to FDIC deposit insurance or their ability to stay in business. Repeat offenses and, in particular, order violations, may be a sign that an institution’s condition or behavior is unsafe and unsound.

For licensed nonbank institutions, the CFPB will be deepening its collaboration with state licensing officials, so that states can ascertain whether licenses should be suspended or whether corporate assets should be liquidated. If senior management is unable to remedy deep-seated failures, it may be appropriate to liquidate, disband, or otherwise shut down the institution to prevent further harms or legal violations. Indeed, since our nation’s founding, regulators in the U.S. have a history of terminating corporate charters and licenses. Today, this should be considered for institutions of all sizes when the facts and circumstances warrant it.

Finally, the role of individual liability cannot be discounted. When small businesses get in trouble, regulators and enforcers are quick to target the top brass. It is inappropriate and unfair to not have the same approach to big financial institutions when the facts and circumstances of the role of individuals is the same.

Agency and court orders bind officers and directors of the corporation, and so do the laws themselves, so there are multiple ways in which individuals are held accountable. Where individuals play a role in repeat offenses and order violations, it may be appropriate for regulatory agencies and law enforcers to charge these individuals and disqualify them. Dismissal of senior management and board directors, and lifetime occupational bans should also be more frequently deployed in enforcement actions involving large firms.

When it comes to individuals, we also need to pay close attention to executive compensation incentives. Important remedies for restoring law and order may include clawbacks, forfeitures, and other changes to executive compensation, including where we tie up compensation for longer periods of time and use that deferred compensation as the first pot of money to pay fines.

Such actions are more likely to halt recidivism than fines paid from the profits of wrongdoing.

***

In the end, large dominant firms should be subject to the same consequences of enforcement actions as small firms. We need to end double-standard enforcement that exists. We need to move away from just monetary penalties and consider an arsenal of options that really work to stop repeat offenses.

More importantly, when the public perceives that powerful actors in the economy and society live by a different set of rules, this deeply undermines the promise of the rule of law and our market system. We can and must change course on this. Thank you.

SHARE & PRINT

First of all, I thank Uncle Allan Madden for that warm welcome to country on my very first visit to Australia. On behalf of all my colleagues, allow me to pay my respects to the traditional owners of these lands. Also, my thanks to Alan Kirkland for his thoughtful introduction and to all of you for making me feel so much at home. Over the years, I have spoken to many groups where we would debate who deserved the credit for having traveled the farthest to be present. Never before have I been more certain of my qualifications to claim that particular prize!

It is encouraging to be here with so many people who share similar goals and ideals for our global society. I am honored to be chosen to deliver the Ruby Hutchison Memorial lecture. In meetings over the past few days, you have shed much light on our common challenges and aspirations. I have also had the occasion to learn more about our namesake here today and her deep commitment to basic fairness for all consumers. The historical arc of our countries may be different, the evolution of our societies may be different, the structure of our economies may be different, but one strong thread ties us all together. That thread is the difficult, important, and humbling mission of establishing a financial marketplace that is responsible and sustainable for individual consumers, people who have come to depend on credit and other financial services to create opportunities for themselves and their families.

As a single mother of seven children, Ruby Hutchison was well aware of how vulnerable people can be to fraud and exploitation. In an era when formal consumer protections hardly existed, she was determined to inform consumers about their rights. She also found new and innovative ways to strengthen those rights. Her determination to tell people about products, their value, and their safety led to the birth of CHOICE magazine in April 1960.

At around the same time, these issues were beginning to receive more attention in the United States also. In March of 1962, John F. Kennedy addressed the Congress on the subject of identifying and protecting the common interest people share as consumers of goods and services. In discussing a Consumer Bill of Rights, President Kennedy spoke of Americans but could just as easily have been speaking of Australians or any other group of people around the world when he observed that consumers, “by definition, include us all. They are the largest economic group in the economy, affecting and affected by almost every public and private economic decision. Two-thirds of all spending in the economy is by consumers. But they are the only important group in the economy who are not effectively organized, whose views are often not heard.” It is this Presidential address that we now commemorate by our annual celebration of World Consumer Rights Day.

As the years unfold, the time may come when we have our own chance to wade into the currents of history. In my case, I have come to serve as the first Director of the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau was created by our Congress in the wake of the global financial crisis. Before that, the authority to administer and enforce various federal consumer financial laws was scattered across seven federal agencies. For each of these agencies, consumer financial protection was only one of its various responsibilities. Consequently, no single agency was primarily focused on protecting the everyday users of financial products and services – and consumers paid the price when the financial crisis hit us all so hard.

All of that changed with the advent of the Consumer Bureau. We are now the only agency in the United States government with the sole mission of protecting people in the consumer financial marketplace. The rules we write apply to all providers of consumer financial services. We also have the authority to supervise and enforce those rules, and the governing laws, with respect to the largest banks as well as nonbank financial firms such as mortgage lenders, payday lenders, and others.

The most important financial transactions in people’s lives come within our province. Whether it is to pay their bills or finance larger investments in their futures, most people now use credit to help manage their affairs. Credit cards give us quick access to money when we need it. Student loans help us obtain a post-secondary education. Mortgages make it possible to buy a home and spread the payments over many years. In all of these areas and more, the Consumer Bureau was established to stand on the side of consumers and ensure they are treated fairly. Since we opened our doors less than four years ago, we have been intent on making consumer financial markets work better and helping people improve their financial lives.

***

With the provision of financial products and services, as with many things in life, it takes two to tango. Every such transaction involves both a financial provider and a consumer. If we want to raise the standard for how these financial markets actually work, it behooves us to consider what we may be able to do to foster improved behavior on both sides of the table. We need to focus on what we can do to incentivize financial providers to engage in sounder lending and more responsible conduct. We also need to consider how we can help individuals obtain and build the skills to make sustainable choices that serve their own life goals.

In thinking about these issues, I will be making an effort to respond directly to two suggestions you raised for my consideration in your invitation to deliver this speech. One suggestion was to talk about whether regulators can change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center. The other suggestion was to discuss the issue of communication with consumers, including financial literacy, rights, and protections.

***

Before turning to those matters, however, it seems important to establish some perspective on the role of regulation at the outset. Certainly part of the job here is to discern risks to consumers and protect them by minimizing those risks. But then we run pretty quickly up against the tendency in any human organization to err on the side of seeking disproportionately to eliminate risk altogether, even at the expense of the objectives that are served by the underlying activity. We see this tendency in the sporting world in teams that play not to lose rather than play to win. We see it in legal calculations that tend to elevate the safety of inaction over even the most minimal perils of action. And we see it in the regulatory world in an overcautious emphasis to maintain the status quo rather than allow for dynamic change that brings new uncertainties but is itself the essence of progress.

This is a natural human tendency, but it would be misguided here. It reflects an instinctive view of regulation as a defensive and negative enterprise, as a pinched and crabbed attempt to smother the underlying vitality of market participants seeking to fulfill their own ends. It can generate an orientation that is anti-market and even, in various ways, anti-consumer. I have noticed a deep but somewhat understandable skepticism about the regulatory mindset – a belief that it is bound to be paternalistic, seeking to prescribe all the decisions that individuals should be at liberty to make for themselves. That mindset would be destructive of human freedom, of human ingenuity and initiative. It would disserve our mission, and it is most emphatically not the view held by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Instead, we regard ourselves as pro-market and pro-consumer. We want consumers to thrive. And therefore we want responsible financial providers to be able to thrive also by serving them well. So we begin from the basic premise that there is no reason for anyone – least of all those charged with protecting consumers – to decry the structure of the free-market economy in the abstract. Adam Smith taught us how the invisible hand can lead firms to serve the interests of their customers. These customers, as he also taught us, are those who choose to give their “custom” – meaning their customary business not only now, but for the foreseeable future – to those firms best able to satisfy their particular demands. To adapt a phrase from a populist American politician from the era of our Great Depression – ironic in that he was a vehement critic of capitalism – the smooth operation of the free market can succeed in creating a system in which “Everyone is a king, but no one wears a crown.”

If you are initially inclined to doubt this, take a moment and think about what capitalism has meant over the past century for the average person in our so-called “Western” economies. The cost of many products has fallen significantly over time, and the sophistication of machinery and technology now available to each of us would be utterly astonishing to our forebears. For a short list, think of washing machines, clothes dryers, indoor plumbing, heating and cooling systems, stoves and ovens, automobiles, radio and television, personal computers, cellular telephones, tablets, music players, and a list that goes on for quite a while. This is not to say that everything in our economy does operate smoothly – we are too familiar with stubborn poverty and still too close to the global financial crisis to believe that – but in the grand scheme of things, one group that has surely benefited over this lengthy period of history has been the broad consumer public.

By the same token, innovation and progress in the financial realm have had similar effects on the general population. Credit that was virtually non-existent a hundred years ago is widespread today. And credit means opportunity. This is a very important truth to bear in mind here. Credit entails risk, no doubt, and risk can lead to nasty results, but risk also promises reward and hence credit gives us something to work with – something that may allow us to make more of our lives tomorrow than we have yet attained today. It may allow for investments such as the purchase of a home or a car. It may allow for investments in human capital – loans for education or job training, for example. It may give us some limited ability to make purchases to meet our needs today with money we do not expect will come until later. The ability to time-shift the ways and means of our lives creates more convenience and flexibility in our daily affairs, all of which is beneficial for the average person. And as for specific financial products, think of checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, debit cards, ATM machines, credit reporting, mortgage loans, car loans, on-line bill pay, direct deposit, money transfers, and on and on. In the financial realm, also, a major beneficiary of all this progress has been the ordinary consumer.

So consumers can exert substantial power, both individually and collectively, within a well-functioning free-market economy. People can be their own best consumer protectors as long as the market operates properly, without undue obstacles to their primary position as individual decision-makers who have what they need to make informed decisions. But we also know that ideal world may not reflect our common experience, and we must strive toward its attainment.

With that context in mind, we can return to our two central questions: First, how can regulators change the culture of financial service providers to persuade them to put the interests of consumers at their center? Second, how can regulators (or others) help build financial capability by communicating effectively about financial literacy and protections so consumers can be in the best position to look out for their own interests? What follows is a progress report on how we are treating each of these issues in the work we are doing at the Consumer Bureau. No doubt there are other and better ideas people may have, either now or over time, about how to pursue these objectives. And let me be the first to say that we are all ears, always, to hear people’s thoughts about different and more effective approaches. I am not aware of any playbook that sets the rules for how we can optimally perform these tasks. But we have begun to settle into our work, and certain strategies and themes are beginning to emerge from our experiences thus far. So I appreciate your patience as I bend your ear for a bit.

***

Changing the culture of financial service providers – or any for-profit business enterprises – is a tall order. In a free-market economy, the culture revolves around making money; and in an economy built around competing firms, the companies operate on behalf of their owners, which are the shareholders who own their corporate stock. The incentives here are strong and compelling. They are governed by a legal regime that creates a duty to maximize shareholder value and they are driven by the innate self-interest that motivates most human behavior.

But free markets are not simply untrammeled hubbubs of chaotic human activity. Despite what we may seem to see on any trading floor, anarchy in the marketplace has never worked and never will work. On the contrary, in more developed economies our markets operate within the broad confines of legal principle backed by legal compulsion. If someone violates a contract, they can be sued to restore or repair the mutual obligations they had agreed upon. If someone seizes the property of another, the law is available to decide whether they have acted wrongfully and, if so, to make them surrender what they have unjustly appropriated for themselves. Even in a bare-bones “night watchman” state posited by a few theorists, free markets rest on the effective regulation of law and order imposed, at a minimum, by the common law and the criminal law.

For about the last century in America, and increasingly in many of the world’s more developed market economies, this skeletal outline has been filled in more completely by the additional apparatus of formal government regulation. In the United States, a number of government agencies – including the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – play a role in ensuring that free markets also operate fairly, and that some of the disequilibria generated by no-holds-barred capitalism can be smoothed out to some degree. As we saw with the meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market that played such a large role in the global financial crisis, any significant economic disequilibrium can create destructive externalities in the broader economy – in this case, massive job losses, widespread home foreclosures, and crushing reductions in retirement savings within the American economy and great instability transmitted to the world economy.

As we also have seen, though the economy inevitably seeks to return to some market-clearing equilibrium over time, the period of dislocation can be substantial. We are now at six-and-a-half consecutive years of unprecedented levels of near-zero real interest rates in the U.S. economy, for instance, which is rivaling the length of the Great Depression in its severity. As Lord Keynes once ruefully noted about the classical economists and their tidy equilibrium models, “in the long run, we are all dead.” The existence of such real-world flaws undermines the neat graphs of the classical economic models and gives us reason to consider more substantive regulatory interventions that may help safeguard the smooth functioning of economic markets.

In short, not all dynamics of the market economy are driven by what is best for consumers – other influences are at work upon corporate behavior as well. And if we focus most narrowly on what drives profit and innovation for providers, we must recognize that the long-term interest of the consumer public is not always compatible with the behavior we see in the short run. In various market situations, the long-term interests of consumers and the short-run interests of providers can turn out to be oppositional, and much corporate ingenuity is channeled into various schemes to collect rents and exploit superior market positions. It was Adam Smith, after all, who observed that “people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.” Notably, some economic innovations can harm consumers even as they may seem to benefit providers, at least for a time. Exotic mortgage products of the last decade, for instance, were innovations that visited devastating harm on many borrowers – wiping out their savings, ruining their credit, and driving them into foreclosure and economic instability. Yet these products and the shoddy underwriting that accompanied them were widely pursued and maintained for years, despite the risks that were apparent on their face.

So if our free-market economy is not always marked by happy levels of equilibrium that maximize consumer welfare, what kinds of influences may complicate the scene? In addition to pressure from consumers, providers can be affected by other market actors – including competitors, suppliers, shareholders, and employees. They also can be buffeted by pressures external to a particular market, such as exogenous shocks.

One area that deserves our attention is the effect of the law that regulates economic conduct. That body of law can emanate from many sources – including legislators, judges, and various types of executive officials – and it can oscillate over time, even rather unpredictably. Depending on how these influences play out, there can be many obstacles to economic markets mechanically promoting the best interests of consumers. Accordingly, there can be opportunities to correct for market failures, imbalances, and distortions that are harmful to consumers.

But just how are we to unpack all of this? And how should we, as regulators, go about trying to change the culture of financial service providers to focus them on the interests of consumers in face of the numerous pressures that may lead them to do otherwise? Those are hard questions, especially in light of the humbling realization that the regulators are human beings themselves who lack omniscience. But we have one key point as our compass, which is to put the voice of the consumer at the heart of our mission and make it the center of attention for financial providers as well. So let me talk about four things we are doing to accomplish this goal.

***

If our work is to be guided by the voice of the consumer, we must first take pains to hear that voice. We do this most squarely through our consumer response function. Congress required this new agency to establish a system for collecting, investigating, and responding to consumer complaints. In carrying out this duty, we have created the opportunity to hear directly from consumers what is on their minds and what challenges and concerns they are facing in their everyday lives as they seek to navigate the consumer financial marketplace.

The project here is powerfully motivated by the economic self-interest of consumers themselves, who hope that by submitting a complaint they can achieve a resolution and perhaps redress of their grievance. Once a consumer submits a complaint to the Bureau, we forward it via a secure web portal to the appropriate company, which reviews the information, communicates with the consumer as needed, and determines what action to take in response. The company reports back to us and to the consumer on strict time frames. We then invite the consumer to review the response and provide feedback. We review the feedback, using this information along with any other information we may have to prioritize complaints for investigation.

Behind each complaint lie the troubles of real people, the people behind the data. They bring to life the true impact that consumer financial markets can have on individual lives and families. To date, the Bureau has fielded over 550,000 complaints about a wide range of products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, student loans, auto loans, bank accounts and services, credit reporting, debt collection, payday loans, money transfers, prepaid cards, and other consumer loans.

Through this process alone, the Bureau has helped consumers secure millions of dollars in monetary relief and further satisfaction in the form of non-monetary relief, such as cleaning up their credit reports or fending off errant or harassing debt collectors, which can have ripple effects on people’s financial well-being as well as their peace of mind. Moreover, specific complaints sometimes help us target consumers for timely and focused advice about how they might go about understanding and addressing those issues on their own.

As we analyze and aggregate complaints in different ways, they become more than just an issue for the particular consumer. Evaluating the broader pattern of complaints enables us to identify potentially systemic issues and prioritize problems. For example, hearing from students who cannot afford to repay their private student loans and are working two jobs to make ends meet can teach us more about the kinds of information students need before they take out those loans. Or if older Americans tell us about problems with reverse mortgages, we can devote resources to exploring measures to address the problems they are describing.

We also offer our Consumer Complaint Database, which makes the underlying data available to the public to inform and affect the marketplace. As we are hearing from hundreds of thousands of consumers at an increasing rate, this growing repository of information yields an ever-more-detailed impression of what is happening to consumers in real time in the marketplace. This data can be helpful to industry and consumers alike in figuring out how to approach these issues. We are well aware that not all, or even most, consumer protection comes from government agencies. Market participants themselves are initially responsible for fundamental aspects of consumer protection including, for example, how a business decides to treat its customers and whether people are willing and able to stand up for themselves when they are mistreated. With this in mind, the Bureau has made information about consumer complaints available to the public, with the ability to download the data, aggregate it in various ways, and filter it based on specific search criteria, such as by complaint type, company, zip code, date, or any other combination of available variables.

We believe the disclosure of this information is one of the best tools government agencies can use to improve the operation of the marketplace. People across the spectrum can make their own judgments about it. For financial companies, this data can help them detect and understand problems in the rest of the market and assess their performance against their peers, which is information they cannot access in any other way. In fact, institutions have shown they want to minimize the number of complaints we receive about them and improve their handling of complaints. Data can also help them detect and reduce regulatory, enforcement, and litigation risks. And perhaps they can find things to tout in the data: taking credit, for example, for having low complaint volumes or quick response times.

For consumers, the database can be a valued educational and shopping tool. They can see how companies respond and draw their own conclusions. Finally, anyone who wishes to do so can use the information to rate companies and products by evaluating what has been said about them in the aggregate, with opportunities for companies to respond with their own analysis. These matters can be fought out in the marketplace of ideas, subject ultimately to the verdict rendered by the court of public opinion, which is just how economic marketplaces are designed to work.

***

Our second approach to affecting the behavior of financial providers lies in our compulsory work through our supervision and law enforcement tools to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws. Through examinations, we can look into every pertinent aspect of how a firm interacts with consumers and require specific changes to be made to come into compliance with the law, including avoiding or terminating unlawful practices that are unfair to consumers. Redress to make consumers whole for past violations is also part of this process.

One notable aspect of the supervisory work we are doing is to create parity across competitors in each consumer financial market. Previously, the regulatory structure had been partial and incomplete, with federal oversight limited to chartered institutions such as banks, thrifts, and credit unions for purely historical and accidental reasons. Other financial companies competed against them but were not subject to the same level of scrutiny about their compliance efforts. We are now taking necessary and important steps to level the playing field in these markets, which is essential for a rational regulatory structure to have the chance to succeed.

Where appropriate, we seek such changes through enforcement actions also, which we can pursue in court or through our own administrative proceedings. In such actions, we can obtain injunctive relief as well as financial relief, including restitution or disgorgement for the benefit of consumers; we also impose civil penalties in cases as warranted by the defendant’s misconduct. All of these actions are designed to enforce the consumer financial laws that Congress placed within our authority, including fair lending laws and the statutory prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Those laws are worth nothing if they cannot be made to stick, so this work is crucial to fulfilling our duty to ensure fair, transparent, and competitive markets. Through combined supervisory and enforcement actions to date, we have made $5.3 billion in relief available to over 16 million consumers, and we have collected over $200 million in civil penalties.

From this work, we have come to believe that evenhanded oversight is necessary to foster true competition and ensure that all consumers are treated fairly in the marketplace. When honest and innovative businesses can succeed on the merits, it spurs their efforts to drive growth and progress. Appropriate oversight and enforcement empowers consumers by ensuring that markets function transparently. Upstanding businesses benefit the most when we hold accountable those that cheat their customers. Within those boundaries, businesses can compete aggressively with one another; when they do, consumers reap the benefits through improved products and services. Restoring both the perception and the reality of law and order also helps to establish trust in the marketplace for household credit and other financial services. Consumers will be willing to offer their “custom” to providers on an ongoing basis when they feel confident and positive about the products and services they use and when they know themselves to be well served over time.

Throughout the process, we are making it a point to place the voice of the consumer at the center of both our supervision and our enforcement work. As we risk-scope examinations, we decide which companies and products to prioritize and we determine what exactly to look for at a given institution. A key data source is our base of consumer complaints, supplemented by the results of our ongoing market monitoring, which draws on a wealth of data and experience.

Consumer complaints also are an invaluable source of information to spur investigations that generate enforcement actions. We are thus able to combine the richness of individual stories with the more authoritative significance that comes when we graduate from anecdote to data. This occurs when we can see not just isolated complaints, but the patterns that are generated by comparing and contrasting hundreds or thousands of such consumer inputs over time. And we likewise look to the same kinds of information generated by other agencies and officials. In one instance – that of our enforcement actions against credit card companies for deceptive marketing of certain add-on products – we took some assurance from finding that similar practices had harmed consumers and led to extensive enforcement activity in other countries as well.

***

The third way we are affecting the behavior of financial providers is through substantive regulation, where it is merited. To some extent, our Congress has made some specific determinations about when we should use this tool. Most notably, it expressly directed us to adopt sweeping new rules to root out some of the worst abuses in the mortgage market, either restricting or banning certain exotic products and practices that had harmed consumers and insisting on more robust levels of engagement between providers and consumers to avoid and mitigate such harm. We have also undertaken or are considering substantive policy interventions on remittance transfers, prepaid cards and accounts, debt collection, and small-dollar loans (sometimes known as “payday loans”). Where we can do so effectively, we are also looking to adopt regulations that improve disclosures around financial products and services. Yet we do not think improved disclosure alone is necessarily an effective substitute for substantive regulation where the latter is justified on the facts as we understand them.

It is important for us to recognize that our power to effect specific change in the business of financial providers is at its zenith when we write new rules. Here we are most clearly exercising quasi-legislative authority as delegated from Congress itself, and we must do so carefully, through deliberate and thoughtful processes. We are obliged to be faithful to the authority actually delegated to us, to make reasonable and well-supported decisions within the range of the discretion conferred upon us, and to work through a public notice-and-comment process to ensure that we seek out and digest a broad range of input before finalizing our regulations.

We can, of course, always revisit our judgments if we find new information indicating that we may not have struck the right balance on our first try. When we are convinced of the need, we have shown that we will not hesitate to put aside pride of authorship in our quest to “get it right” as best we can. We have already adopted meaningful amendments to our initial regulation on remittance transfers to improve its practicality, for example, and we continue to respond to numerous suggestions by adjusting and modifying our rules governing the mortgage market.

But here too, the voice of the consumer is critical to prompting and shaping our efforts. And we will take up that voice wherever we can find it. Of course, we look to our database of consumer complaints as one very useful indicator of the need for such policy interventions. We also closely scrutinize market and field intelligence, looking for developments that may help shape our strategic approach. Consumers, of course, can speak directly to us, but they also speak more generally by their behavior in the marketplace. And we attend closely to what we learn from financial providers themselves, both in direct discussions and by seeing how markets are changing over time. Our regulatory judgments are further informed by what we glean from supervisory examinations and enforcement investigations about the evolving relationships between financial providers and consumers. Once again, we agree here with Adam Smith, who wrote in The Wealth of Nations that “the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.”

***

In addition, we have found that we can affect the behavior of financial providers by publishing information about consumer financial markets, including data showing how the markets operate and illuminating certain practices. We frequently quote former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis – one of America’s original consumer advocates over a century ago – who famously said that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” Through a great number of research reports, white papers, “Data Points,” bulletins, blogs, guidance documents, webinars, and virtually every form of written or oral communication that we can devise, we try to foster and advance public understanding of these issues that are so central to the well-being of individuals and families.

One of our goals is simply greater awareness of these issues, which may help affect the behavior of producers and consumers alike. Another is to influence and engage other policymakers, who have their own authority to act in light of data thus assembled and analyzed. To date, our reports and publications on reverse mortgages, student loans, mortgage origination, medical debt, credit reporting, credit scoring, and payday lending – to present what is not by any means an exhaustive list – has had visible effects on public policy at both the federal and state levels in our federalist system of government. At times, our publications have called out questionable or disreputable practices, and the mere attention to such matters, once spread before the public and the media, tends to have salutary and desirable effects on market behavior.

At the same time, one of our guiding principles is to develop data that will shed more light on consumer financial markets and, to the extent we can, make it available to the public for others to see what we might have missed. If this leads to insights by consumers themselves, advocates, academics, journalists, industry, and others, then so much the better. Here too, international comparisons may be apt at times, and we draw your attention to our published reports, research, and discussions made available on our website at consumerfinance.gov. We hope you will consider how any of this information might be put to use in new and innovative ways. But then, please, do us the favor of telling us about it as well!

***

Finally, we come to the other question you had originally posed: How can regulators (or others) empower consumers by communicating effectively with them about issues like financial literacy, rights, and protections so that they can be in the best position to look out for their own interests? This is a subject of urgent interest across borders and cultures, for wherever there are consumers, they have difficulties managing the ways and means of their lives.

As we saw earlier, in most places we have certainly come a long way as consumers from the state of nature pessimistically described by Thomas Hobbes: “and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” But we all are keenly aware of our lack of comprehensive knowledge about these matters. And more than that, we feel an incapacity at times to act on what we know by doing the right things – that is to say, the prudent or sensible things – that may be most compatible with our own self-interest, properly understood as projected over time. Behavioral economists are developing and testing various theories about why consumers often fail to make sound choices that will be sustainable over the longer trajectory of their future lives. We need to have an active conversation about financial choices and financial management, both to learn the best paths and to find ways to traverse them effectively.

Let me be the first to say that we have not discovered any magic answers here. Among the many challenges are the inconvenient facts that financial issues can be intricate and complex, that they may press on sensitive sore spots, that people often are embarrassed or ashamed to discuss them candidly, and that the busy occupations of life do not lend themselves to setting aside time for concentrated study of such matters, even if we knew where to go for such guidance.

We are committed to undertaking new research to learn more about how to proceed here, including our recent report on the topic of financial well-being, which I invite you to read. But in the meantime, we are not content to wait while we study, and so we are acting on certain instincts in trying to reach consumers with appropriate and helpful information. Let me describe our main projects and some of our thinking about them, in hopes of stimulating further ideas from you and others.

To begin with, we start from the recognition that consumer financial markets are difficult for people to navigate effectively. One crucial task is to find ways to render this landscape more accessible to people if we possibly can. The markets for consumer credit and household finance hold more potential than ever before, but they are also more complex than ever before. And with complexity comes more risk of getting it wrong and being harmed. When my parents were raising a family fifty years ago, the products and services available to them were more limited but also more straightforward. Basic mortgages, a few in-store credit cards, and some limited consumer loans were about the extent of the offerings. There was not much to be done with them, but it was not possible to get into too much trouble unless you tried pretty hard to do so.

Today, the array of offerings is much broader and the actual mechanics can be harder to grasp. On the front end, credit reporting and scoring have opened more horizons for tapping consumer credit markets, and on the back end the increased tools and resources available to debt collectors, along with computerized recordkeeping, may lengthen the damaging tail of credit failures. Over the years, strenuous efforts to address consumer finance issues through detailed and extensive disclosures have had only partial success. This approach has made it hard to distinguish what is important from what is unimportant. Consumers may fail to understand the description of costs and risks and many simply avoid wading into the increasingly fine print altogether.

Our main strategy for attacking these problems has been what we call our “Know Before You Owe” approach to various consumer financial products and services. Essentially, it is a short-form approach to consumer disclosures, drawing on the concept of executive summaries found today at the front of most lengthy reports in almost any field. By leveraging our expertise and consumer research to pull out the most essential points and help people focus on them, we are making it possible once again to see the forest for the trees. This approach seeks to avoid failed decision-making, with consequent troubles and regrets. After all, two basic premises of a well-functioning market are first, that buyers and sellers understand the terms of the deal, and second, that buyers are able to compare possible alternatives.

We have heard many such regrets from consumers describing decisions they made about their mortgages, home equity loans, student loans, and other credit products. By streamlining disclosures and highlighting the key points about costs and risks, our new agency has joined in the lead set by our Congress to create simplified and more uniform disclosures for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans that also make it easier to compare the pros and cons of competing products. We are also working on the same approach in our proposed regulations for prepaid cards. So one way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by revising the kind of information they receive when they make decisions about obtaining financial products and services. We believe this will help especially by making it easier for consumers to avoid the pitfalls and confusions of “back-end pricing,” where the apparent terms of the deal as presented up front do not match the ultimate terms when they are revealed, or perhaps as they have migrated, somewhere down the road.

Another way we are trying to communicate more effectively with consumers is by forging partnerships with those who already have developed substantial trust and expertise with certain segments of the public. We are working with them to deliver content to consumers on financial issues as an integrated piece of the work they are already doing to deliver other services. With social service providers, and now with labor unions, community volunteers, and legal services offices, we have been developing a toolkit we call “Your Money, Your Goals,” which provides training to address topics like budgeting daily expenses, managing debt, and avoiding financial tricks and traps. We also are partnering with hundreds of library systems all over the country to train librarians, deliver content, and encourage sessions that bring in other partners such as credit counseling services. These resources for addressing consumer financial issues are striking a chord with patrons who, we have found, are turning to their local libraries in growing numbers to deal with their personal economic issues.

An important and difficult issue in the United States is how to accomplish what everyone knows needs to be done, which is to communicate more effectively with young people in our schools through greater focus on financial education. In our country, education operates primarily at the state and local level, which means that control over the classroom is not readily susceptible to centralized decision-making that can set the specifics of the curriculum. A growing number of states are taking action to incorporate more financial education into the classroom. But even in the wake of the global financial crisis, where many consumers were hurt badly by their lack of know-how in guarding against potential harm, progress here seems achingly slow. We have published a report summarizing the best thinking in the area of K-12 financial education in the United States, with our recommendations. But we are quite interested in efforts we see being made around the world, and we are aware that we may have much to learn from you and others about how we can better develop our young people into stronger and more capable consumers.

Although I will not undertake to summarize all of the work we are doing here, one further way we are communicating with consumers is by developing resources to help people find the information they need, at the right time, to manage some of the challenges they are confronting. Certain financial decisions are not everyday matters, but may arise only once or twice in a lifetime. Almost by definition, we lack experience and expertise with such issues, which may nonetheless be some of the most significant and lasting decisions we will ever make.

In the United States, two such major decisions concern paying for college and buying a home. With the U.S. Department of Education we created a “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet” to help students navigate the complex world of student loans; it allows students to compare financial aid packages and to understand the burdens they will face after graduation. We have built around that resource to create a set of tools we call “Paying for College” to help people navigate this decision-making process from beginning to end.

More recently, we launched another set of resources that we call “Owning a Home,” which is an interactive, online toolkit designed to help consumers as they shop for a mortgage. These tools are designed to give consumers the information and confidence they need to get the best deal. Right now, we have made public the beta version of this resource, which will be enhanced and improved over the course of the year.

Another, broader resource is “Ask CFPB,” an online database that provides carefully considered answers to over a thousand questions we have been frequently asked by consumers. The answers reflect the deep expertise of our colleagues, but are laid out in plain language to make them easy to understand. They also are grouped by issue area, so that if a consumer encounters a new problem with a debt collector, for example, they can learn all about their rights and the issues that may be involved. In this manner, we are seeking to help people engage in consumer self-protection, which is critical to their empowerment. We continue to add more questions and refine the answers in response to suggestions and comments from the public – including, if you are willing, from you as well.

Finally, we are communicating with consumers through specialty offices that home in on unique problems faced by certain categories of consumers. We focus on students, older Americans, servicemembers, and those with low to moderate incomes who are often financially vulnerable. This focus allows us to understand and address particular challenges that impede their financial success. It also enables us to reach out more effectively to provide these populations with the resources that will help them deal with the same kinds of problems that confront consumers more generally.

Those are some of the main examples of how we are seeking to communicate more effectively with consumers. As we work to ensure that financial institutions are not designing or marketing products in ways that hurt consumers, we are also striving to put people in a position to make good choices for themselves, choices that enhance their lives and empower them to succeed. People need better information about the costs and risks of borrowing. They need to be able to comparison shop for a good deal. They deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the deal they were promised is the deal they are actually getting, not just tomorrow, but next month and next year as well. It is not so easy for people to figure out where to go to find such answers from a neutral source. Much of the information they may find on-line today is shaped by financial providers that are trying to sell a product or service, which may skew the advice they are giving. It is quite important for our new agency to continue to build a reputation as a trusted, expert, neutral resource that can look out for consumers and help them look out for themselves.

I have spoken at length here tonight, and now I am almost done. Obviously the project of affecting the behavior of financial providers and financial consumers poses enormous challenges. We have seen all too clearly that if these products are predatory, or if they are misunderstood or misused, they can do real damage to people’s lives. At the Consumer Bureau, we envision a financial marketplace where providers play by the rules and treat consumers fairly. In addition, people need to make choices that fit their circumstances – nobody can do that for them – and take responsibility for the choices they make. They should be able to have the confidence that comes from knowing that dangerous or abusive products and practices are being limited. Through fair rules, consistent oversight, appropriate law enforcement, and broad consumer engagement, we are helping to restore trust in these markets, protect consumers from improper conduct, and ensure access to a fair, competitive, and transparent financial marketplace.

That is a worthy piece of work for anyone, anywhere. As Albert Camus said in the Myth of Sisyphus, “The struggle itself . . . is enough to fill one’s heart.” So let me close by saying that we look forward to working with you and the international community to improve people’s financial lives across the globe. Together, we can perpetuate the steadfast spirit of Ruby Hutchison as we seek to fulfill our shared goals. The people we serve are the ones who deserve that the most. Thank you.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a 21st century agency that implements and enforces Federal consumer financial law and ensures that markets for consumer financial products are fair, transparent, and competitive. For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov.

It’s always a good time to give your student debt repayment plan a check-up. Regardless of your situation, there are some basic steps you can take to avoid stress and save money in the long run.

Understand what makes student loans unique
Take control of your loans
Save yourself time and money
Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)
Get an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans
Exercise your rights as a servicemember
Avoid scams and wasting money
Take action when you run into problems
Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Learn more about ways to pay off your student loan debt.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

Questions to ask your servicer about rehabilitation and consolidation
Questions to ask your servicer about pausing student loan payments
You have other options for help
If you have a problem with a student loan, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPB about federal or private student loans.
You can file a complaint with Federal Student Aid  about federal loans. These complaints can be escalated to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group  .
Contact your state attorney general to file a complaint . Your state may also have a student loan ombudsman. Search the name of your state with “student loan ombudsman.”
The student financial aid department at your school may be able to provide guidance."

Your financial well-being, or overall financial situation, is unique to you. Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.

The story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. 

How would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.

Understand where your money goes 

The prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.

1. Take our quiz to see how healthy your finances are.

Answer just 10 questions to measure your financial well-being and get a few steps for making improvements. Take it now, then take it again later to see if your story has changed.

2. Learn where your money is coming from.

Before you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.

3. Learn where your money is going.

Fill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.

4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.

If you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.

Small changes can make a big difference

There are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. 

5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.

Your cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .

6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.

If there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .

7. Compare your spending month-to-month.

Track your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.

Save for emergencies

Saving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. 

8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.

Start by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.

9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.

Set guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.

10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.

Whether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.

11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.

There may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.

12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.

For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.

Reduce your debt 

Paying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.

13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.

Use our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.

14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.

There are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.

15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.

Whether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.

16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

Plan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.

Create better money habits 

Improving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. 

17. Apply only for credit you need.

While it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.

18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.

You’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.

19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.

Through most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.

20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.

Missing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.

21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.

One of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.

Plan for success

Planning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. 

22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.

Break down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.

23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.

If you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.

24. Make your savings consistent.

Putting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .

25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.

Once you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!

If you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.

Prepared Remarks of Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Field Hearing on Student Loan Debt

May 8, 2013

Good evening, and thank you for joining us for our field hearing on student loan debt. It has long been ingrained in the fabric of our country that if you work hard, study well, and act responsibly, you can get ahead in life. Benjamin Franklin once said, “An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.” From a young age, we impress upon our children that education can be an important milestone on the pathway to opportunity. That has been true in my own life, and I am sure it is true for many people here in this room.

But a college degree has the potential to become more of a burden than a blessing for those saddled with unmanageable debt in a tough employment market. We have heard from frustrated borrowers across the country. Thousands of private student loan borrowers feel like they have hit a wall. The unfortunate reality is that many private loans do not have the same affordable payment options as federal loans. Many private student loan borrowers have run out of options and are struggling to make ends meet. Student debt has become the defining feature of their lives – the millstone around their necks that holds them back from a full financial future. One borrower, Samantha, told us that she feels like she is “trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose.”

Last year, the Bureau released a study describing practices in the private student loan market that resembled some of the practices in the subprime market for mortgage lending before the financial crisis. Although it appears that those practices may have subsided and new borrowers may not face the same risks, many who took out those high-rate loans remain stuck.

We have also received complaints and stories from thousands of borrowers who have run into trouble repaying their private student loans. They feel trapped by high interest rates and some are frustrated about being unable to navigate issues through their loan servicer. We have seen especially shameful examples of poor servicing performance as servicemembers try to obtain the benefits they have earned under the law, but find themselves thwarted by burdensome paperwork and other obstacles. Many of these borrowers did everything right; they worked hard and made years of monthly payments, but still cannot find any refinancing options to get out of those high-rate loans.

This sounds uncomfortably familiar. When I was a local and then a state official in Ohio, I saw homeowners who hit a rough patch and ended up facing similar circumstances. They were not trying to escape their debt, they just wanted to work out a reasonable deal with their mortgage servicer, but no one would help. Consumers were trapped in exotic mortgages with few options, and the repercussions were felt through the economy. We learned a hard lesson in the wake of the mortgage meltdown.

We cannot just sit by and watch this happen to people again.

The Consumer Bureau was created in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Identifying emerging risks to consumers and our economy is an important part of our mission. So we are concerned that unmanageable student loan debt may be harmful to recovering consumer markets and may be dragging down borrowers’ lives. In February, we asked the public how student debt is affecting individual consumers as well as the broader economy, and what should be done about borrowers seeking to lower their payments on private student loans.

***

The response was overwhelming. We heard from nearly 30,000 Americans who wanted to see Washington try to do something to address this issue. Many told us about their day-to-day struggles with expensive loans and steep monthly payments. They also described the life choices they were forced to make in order to stay current on their loans. Many of them are postponing or forgoing major financial milestones like living on their own, starting a family, or buying a home. Others tried to put those choices into context by describing how high monthly student loan payments can diminish personal savings or crowd out other types of consumer spending. What is clear is that the overhang of high student loan debt can constrict the choices many young graduates are able to make about their careers and the communities in which they live.

The potential domino effect of these choices is a particular concern in the housing market. For example, consumers with student loans traditionally had higher rates of home ownership than those without. Because student loans were an indicator of higher levels of education, those consumers typically had higher income and were therefore more likely to buy a home. Today, however, we are seeing some student loan borrowers shying away from such investments. We heard from one borrower, Debra, who said plainly, “I can’t buy a house because of my student loan. I have to rent.” Daria was another who told us, “These loans are stunting my growth as a citizen. No car. No home.”

Census data tells us that nearly six million Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 lived with their parents in 2011. The National Association of Realtors estimates that this age group made up a mere 27 percent of all homebuyers in 2011, the lowest share in the past decade. First-time homebuyers play a critical role in the market by increasing demand and facilitating “move-up” purchases by existing homeowners. Some of the current generation of first-time homebuyers carries record levels of student debt – and this may inhibit their ability to qualify for a mortgage. On top of that, their high monthly loan payments make it hard to save for a down payment.

We heard that the consequences of high student loan debt do not end with the housing markets. College degrees have helped many people start new businesses over the years, and they continue to do so today. Yet the overhang of substantial debt may also stifle innovation and discourage the formation of new businesses by young people. In any business, it is critical to invest funds to hire employees and market your product. But when you are saddled with sky-high monthly student loan payments, those funds can be hard to come by or even qualify for.

Some commenters noted that unmanageable student debt limits their ability to access small business credit. Student debt burdens may require them to divert cash away from their business so they can make monthly student loan payments. Columba was one respondent who told us, “Student debt has pushed [off] my goal to open a small business by not allowing me to save enough money or even [qualify] for a business loan.”

The economic implications of student loan debt spill well beyond housing and small business development and into retirement savings as well. One woman told us that she had to turn to her mother, who was trying to save for retirement, to help her pay down her student loans. Recent research revealed that only half of workers under 30 have enrolled in their employer’s 401(k) plan and barely four out of ten contribute enough to receive a full employer match. We are concerned that those struggling with high student debt today will have no retirement savings to fall back on in the future.

If the consequences of student debt weigh down individuals and economic markets, it is inevitable that they hold back communities as well. Rural areas in particular struggle to attract and retain doctors, nurses, and other young professionals. In many of these communities, car ownership is a prerequisite for employment and rental housing may be scarce. Young consumers bowing under large debt loads may be unable or unwilling to buy a car or a home. The necessity of doing either may be enough to dissuade them from settling in rural communities.

This week is National Teacher Appreciation Week. I can think of many teachers in my life – and I am sure you can too – who made a strong positive impact on my future. But student debt is hitting teachers too. The problems posed for communities can be seen in the many letters we received from teachers, who often have low starting salaries that increase slowly over time. As a result, their high student loan balances can easily become a permanent fixture in their lives. One teacher who wrote us has been teaching for 12 years and still has over $75,000 in remaining student loan debt. She said that because she has chosen to teach, she does “not make enough money to get in front of [her] student loan debt.”

We received comments noting that programs to make student debt more manageable could lead to higher retention of quality teachers. A school district official described the lack of options on private student loans as a threat to keeping good teachers. She told us “this leaves many of our staff members with high student loan payments that may prevent them from staying in the teaching profession.” So not only does student loan debt affect borrowers’ financial lives, but it may reverberate in profoundly harmful ways through our education system, our communities, and the entire American economy.

***

Consumers told us how high monthly payments have left them trapped by their private student loan debt. They told us how this debt has forced them to sacrifice many of the features of middle-class American life. We heard about how these sacrifices have snowballed to the point where they pose a growing risk to other sectors of the economy. And many offered possible solutions to make private student loan debt more manageable.

The Consumer Bureau will be doing its part. We recently proposed a rule that would allow the agency to oversee many of the country’s larger student loan servicers. This oversight would allow us to keep a watchful eye over any servicing company that engages in unfair or deceptive acts or practices toward student loan borrowers. We will also continue to cooperate with the Justice Department to hold accountable those who violate the rights of our women and men in uniform. This is certainly something. But the public told us resoundingly that more can be done.

The comments we received identify some potential policy and market-based solutions to help struggling borrowers with unmanageable private student loan debt. The solutions target three specific problems. First, market participants, policy experts, and individual borrowers suggest that “refi relief” could be an option to help borrowers with expensive private student loans who have done everything right. Second, a number of people propose a “road to recovery” for borrowers who are in distress on their private student loans. Third, many others outline the need for a “credit clean slate” applicable to borrowers in default on their private student loans – like the rehabilitation option already available to some borrowers with federal student loans. Let me describe each of these ideas in somewhat greater detail.

For borrowers who have dutifully managed to make their monthly payments on high-interest private student loans, one of the ideas that policymakers and market participants could consider is providing “refi relief” for student loan borrowers. This approach could give responsible borrowers the opportunity to refinance their debt at market interest rates.

This approach would make sense because students often apply for private student loans when they are young, have scanty credit history, and have little or no income. Lenders must also consider the possibility that borrowers may not graduate or find a job with a salary that allows them to meet their monthly payments. As a result, lenders price new private student loans as if all young borrowers with limited credit present equally high credit risk, and the interest rate on their loans reflects those assumptions by coming in at consistently higher levels.

As a matter of fact, many of those borrowers do manage to finish school, get a good paying job, and make their payments on time. Nonetheless, they are still paying the interest rate of someone who did not yet have any of these attributes. If these borrowers could refinance, their debt would be much more manageable. Given today’s historically low interest rates, there is a tremendous opportunity for lenders to take advantage of an underserved market. Some people noted in their comments that a robust refinance market for private student loans could provide a break for consumers who have better credit than when they first borrowed and now deserve to have a fair shot at qualifying for lower interest rates.

Another proposal could apply to borrowers in distress, including those who have fallen behind on private loans. Here, people suggested the option of providing distressed borrowers with a road to recovery. One of the reasons private student loan debt can pose such a challenge for consumers is that these loans have less repayment flexibility and other borrower protections than federal student loans. Most private loans have few options available for alternative payment plans, but those who commented said that if lenders had more incentive to work with borrowers trapped in debt, both could benefit. So policymakers might consider creating a potential path forward for those borrowers: a transparent, step-by-step process with affordable payment terms where monthly payments are lowered to match a reasonable debt-to-income ratio.

Some borrowers, however, may need more than just alternative payment options. They may already be in default with severely damaged credit. Damaged credit can be a huge roadblock for consumers, making it impossible for them to borrow money for any other purpose, including the pursuit of even their most sensible aspirations. Some in the industry contend that policymakers should create a way for borrowers to repair their credit and get out of default – what might be called a “credit clean slate.”

Something similar already exists for borrowers with federal student loans – a program that can limit some of the negative credit effects of default. With the option of a clean slate, consumers may be able to qualify for a mortgage or an auto loan that otherwise would have been denied, which could open up new paths forward for them to get a firmer foothold to climb the economic ladder.

***

Everyone who cares about the future of this country should be focused closely on the many problems posed by a growing student loan debt burden borne by some of our best young people. What is at stake is whether some of our most motivated and ambitious citizens – who have the talent to make something of themselves, and lack only the means – will be able to rise and form part of the future leadership of this nation. If instead their hopes and dreams are diverted, discouraged, and defeated by the crushing burdens of a debt that ruins their prospects, we all will be poorer as a result.

So this problem should be sounding an alarm bell for all Americans.

At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we have been working to address the student debt problem from a variety of angles. We have an array of online tools and resources to help students and their families navigate the complicated college financing process. Whether someone is just starting to think about paying for college or has already graduated and is grappling with loan payments, we have new tools to help inform these decisions. But we know that much more needs to be done to help private student loan borrowers who are finding that they are running out of options.

The ideas discussed today are just a few examples of the ways in which policymakers and market participants can work with borrowers to help manage their student loan debt. The pursuit of higher education should not become an insurmountable roadblock to opportunity for many of our fellow citizens. Indeed, it should be the very opposite: it should be a pathway to progress and personal development that strengthens our society.

At the Consumer Bureau, we are committed to helping students understand debt before they take it on, helping them manage their debt once they have incurred it, and addressing complaints and concerns they may have about their lenders or loan servicers. When we create more options to empower consumers to make responsible decisions about their debt, we all can benefit. But we can clearly see the gravity of what is at stake, not just for these young people, but for all of us, and we must feel the growing urgency around these issues.

I look forward to a vigorous discussion about student loans this evening and to hearing from all of you. Thank you.

What is an emergency fund?

An emergency fund is a cash reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical bills, or a loss of income.

In general, emergency savings can be used for large or small unplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine monthly expenses and spending.




Why do I need it?

Without savings, a financial shock—even minor—could set you back, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting impact.

Research suggests that individuals who struggle to recover from a financial shock have less savings to help protect against a future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to debt that’s generally harder to pay off. They may also pull from other savings, like retirement funds, to cover these costs.

Get a sense of your financial well-being

Take our quiz




How much do I need in it?

The amount you need to have in an emergency savings fund depends on your situation. Think about the most common kind of unexpected expenses you’ve had in the past and how much they cost. This may help you set a goal for how much you want to have set aside.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck or don’t get paid the same amount each week or month, putting any money aside can feel difficult. But, even a small amount can provide some financial security.

Keep reading to find the savings strategy, or strategies, that work best for you.




How do I build it?

There are different strategies to get your savings started. These strategies cover a range of situations, including if you have a limited ability to save or if your pay tends to fluctuate. It may be that you could use all of these strategies, but if you have a limited ability to save, managing your cash flow or putting away a portion of your tax refund are the easiest ways to get started.

Strategy: Create a savings habit

Building a savings of any size is easier when you’re able to consistently put money away. It’s one of the fastest ways to see it grow. If you’re not in a regular practice of saving, there are a few key principles to creating and sticking to a savings habit:

Set a goal. Having a specific goal for your savings  can help you stay motivated. Establishing your emergency fund may be that achievable goal that helps you stay on track, especially when you’re initially getting started. Use our savings planning tool  to calculate how long it’ll take you to reach your goal, based on how much and how often you’re able to put money away.
Create a system for making consistent contributions. There are a number of different ways to save, and as you’ll read below, setting up automatic recurring transfers is often one of the easiest. It may also be that you put a specific amount of cash aside each day, week, or payday period. Aim to make it a specific amount, and if you can occasionally afford to do more, you’ll watch your savings grow even faster.
Regularly monitor your progress. Find a way to regularly check your savings. Whether it’s an automatic notification of your account balance or writing down a running total of your contributions, finding a way to watch your progress can offer gratification and encouragement to keep going.
Celebrate your successes. If you’re sticking with your savings habit, don’t miss the opportunity to recognize what you’ve accomplished. Find a few ways that you can treat yourself, and if you’ve reached your goal, set your next one.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. If you know you have a regular paycheck or money consistently coming in, you can create a habit to put some of that money towards an emergency savings fund.




Strategy: Manage your cash flow


Your cash flow  is essentially the timing of when your money is coming in (your income) and going out (your expenses and spending). If the timing is off, you can find yourself running short at the end of the week or month, but if you’re actively tracking it, you’ll start to see opportunities to adjust your spending and savings .

For example, you may be able to work with your creditors (like your landlord, utility companies, or credit card companies) to adjust the due dates for your bills, or you can use the weeks when you have more money available to move a little extra into savings.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone. This is one important first step in managing your money, regardless of whether you’re living paycheck to paycheck or have a tendency to spend more than your budget allows.




Strategy: Take advantage of one-time opportunities to save

There may also be certain times during the year when you get an influx of money. For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. There may be other times of the year, like a holiday or birthday, that you receive a cash gift.

While it’s tempting to spend it, saving all or a portion of that money could help you quickly set up your emergency fund.


Who is this helpful for: Anyone but particularly those with irregular income. If you receive a large check from a tax refund or for some other reason, it’s always good to consider putting all or a portion of it away into savings.

Strategy: Make your saving automatic


Saving automatically is one of the easiest ways to make your savings consistent so you start to see it build over time. One common way to do this is to set up recurring transfers through your bank or credit union so money is moved automatically from your checking account to your savings account. You get to decide how much and how often, but once you have it set up, you’ll be making consistent contributions to your savings.

It’s a good idea to be mindful of your balances, however, so you don’t incur overdraft fees if there’s not enough money in your checking account at the time of the automatic transaction. To help you stay mindful, consider setting up automatic notifications or calendar reminders to check your balance.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. Again, you can determine how much and how often to have money transferred between accounts, but you want to make sure you have money coming in. If your situation changes or your income changes, you can always adjust it.




Strategy: Save through work

Another way to save automatically is through your employer. In addition to employer-based contributions for retirement, you may have an option to split your paycheck between your checking and savings accounts. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, check with your employer to see if it’s possible to divide it between two accounts. If you’re tempted to spend your paycheck when you get it, this is an easy way to put money aside without having to think twice.

Who is this helpful for: Those with consistent income. Again, if you’re getting a check from your employer on a regular basis, pay yourself first by putting a portion of it automatically into savings.




Where should I keep it?

Where you put your emergency fund depends on your situation. You want to make sure this fund is safe, accessible, and in a place where you’re not tempted to spend it on non-emergencies.

Here are a few options for where to put your emergency savings, and you can choose the one that makes the most sense for you:


Bank or credit union account — If you have an account with a bank or credit union—generally considered one of the safest places to put your money—it might make sense to have a dedicated account where you can keep and maintain these funds.
Prepaid card — A prepaid card is a card that you can load money onto. It’s not connected with a bank or credit union, and you can only spend the amount that’s on your card.
Cash — Another option is keeping money on hand for emergencies, either in your home or with a trusted family member or friend. Keep in mind that cash can be stolen, lost, or destroyed.




When should I use it?

Set some guidelines for yourself on what constitutes an emergency or unplanned expense. Not every unexpected expense is a dire emergency but try to stay consistent. Even if it’s not a trip to the emergency room, you may need it to pay for a medical bill that wasn’t covered by insurance.

Having a reserve fund for financial shocks can help you avoid relying on other forms of credit or loans that can turn into debt. If you use a credit card or take out a loan to pay for these expenses, your one-time emergency expense may grow significantly larger than your original bill because of interest and fees.

However, don’t be afraid to use it if you need it. If you spend down what’s in your emergency savings, just work to build it up again. Practicing your savings skills over time will make this easier.

Deceptive marketing practices about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer
Question presented

When do remittance transfer providers violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) in their marketing about the speed and cost of sending a remittance transfer?

Response

Remittance transfer providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer. Providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing practices regardless of whether the provider is in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Remittance Rule. For example, among other things, it may be deceptive to:

Market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients;
Market remittance transfers as “no fee” when in fact the provider charges fees;
Market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when an offer is temporary or limited;
Market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free.
Background
Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Pursuant to the CFPB’s Remittance Rule,1 the term “remittance transfer” includes most electronic transfers of funds sent by consumers in the United States to recipients in other countries. Consumers in the United States send hundreds of billions of dollars in remittance transfers to recipients in foreign countries each year.2 Remittance transfers are often consumer-to-consumer transfers of money by immigrants sending financial support to family and friends in other countries. They also include other types of transfers, such as transfers by consumers in the United States to Americans living temporarily abroad, such as students. Consumers may send remittance transfers regularly as an ongoing source of financial assistance or in other circumstances, such as an occasional or emergency form of support. Remittance transfers also include cross-border consumer-to-business payments for goods or services.

Consumers may choose among a range of bank, credit union, and non-bank money transmitters when sending a remittance transfer. Non-bank money transmitters have traditionally dominated the market for remittance transfers from the United States. In recent years, new money transmitters have emerged offering digital remittance transfer services. Many established money transmitters have also added digital services, in addition to in-person options for consumers to go to a store or agent to send remittance transfers.3

When sending remittance transfers, consumers may consider a number of key factors when deciding among different providers, including the speed of the transfer and its cost as well as convenience, security, reliability, and trust.4

The speed of a remittance transfer varies depending on the type of transfer and provider. The World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide database illustrates that a range of transfer speeds can exist within a given remittance corridor, with some providers, for example, offering delivery in less than an hour, and others offering delivery in three to five days.5

Costs can also vary significantly within a remittance corridor. Remittance transfer costs include fees charged by the remittance transfer provider including, if applicable, their agents and third parties. Costs also include any exchange rate costs applied by the provider to the currency conversion and governmental taxes. The exchange rate offered to consumers often reflects a spread – meaning, a percentage difference between the retail exchange rate offered to the consumer and some wholesale exchange rate.6 Remittance transfer providers utilize different pricing strategies when determining the fees and exchange rate they charge to consumers for remittance transfers.

Transparency Concerns Around Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), federal consumer protection laws generally did not apply to remittances, and remittance transfer providers were not consistently required to disclose applicable fees, exchange rates, transfer speeds, and the amount to be received in a transaction. Consumers thus did not always know how much money would be received on the other end and were not able to easily comparison shop among providers.

With the Dodd-Frank Act’s amendments to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the promulgation of the Remittance Rule, remittance transfer providers are now generally required to disclose certain information to consumers before the consumer pays for a transfer and also when payment is made.7 Before the consumer pays for a transfer, the information a remittance transfer provider must disclose includes (but is not limited to): as applicable, the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded; any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer; the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of the amount that will be transferred and any fees imposed and any taxes collected, in the funding currency; the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer; any covered third-party fees; and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The receipt that consumers generally receive when payment is made must contain the same information. In addition, the receipt must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient.

Compliance with the Remittance Rule disclosure requirements does not obviate the obligation to refrain from misleading marketing practices. In particular, remittance transfer providers must ensure their marketing practices do not violate the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in the CFPA.8

The CFPB has identified problems with transparency and accuracy in marketing practices about the speed of a remittance transfer in its supervision of remittance transfer providers and enforcement of the CFPA’s prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. In the CFPB’s Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights, the CFPB discussed examiners’ findings that remittance transfer providers made false and misleading representations about the speed of remittance transfers.9 In October 2023, the CFPB issued a consent order against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, finding that the remittance transfer provider made misleading statements in advertisements about the speed and cost of its services, in violation of the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices.10 This provider claimed in social media marketing that remittance transfers would be delivered “instantly,” in “30 seconds” or “within seconds,” and would incur “no fees,” when in fact transfers often took much longer, and the provider charged a fee.11

In addition, consumers have reported, and the CFPB has observed, problems with price transparency in the marketing practices of remittance transfer providers, resulting in consumers encountering unexpected costs.12 The CFPB has received consumer complaints about promotional pricing by remittance transfer providers who do not sufficiently inform consumers that the advertised fee or exchange rate is only a limited scope or temporary offer. The CFPB has also observed marketing claims by remittance transfer providers that may mislead consumers about the scope or duration of a temporary low or “no fee” offer or promotional exchange rate.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about marketing that omits or obscures the cost of a remittance transfer. Marketing claims by remittance transfer providers may fail to communicate the full cost of a remittance transfer, such as advertising that transfers are “free” or advertising that prominently emphasizes zero fees while only including a vaguely worded statement that additional costs related to the exchange rate may apply. Some of these statements use technical jargon or feature confusing language.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about companies that market “free” remittance transfers through digital wallet and other prepaid products, but that fail to sufficiently disclose costs for currency conversion or for withdrawing funds from the product. Companies that offer remittance transfers through digital wallets and other prepaid products often market them as a faster and cheaper way to send remittance transfers. Certain companies’ websites market “free account-to-account transfers” or that “receiving money from a friend” is free. Providers may disclose only in fine print, however, that these transfers are only free when there is no currency conversion, and that for the recipient to withdraw and use funds in their local currency, they must pay a currency conversion fee. In addition, some digital wallet providers may not make clear that recipients of a remittance transfer must pay a fee to withdraw funds from the digital wallet or other prepaid product. Examples of such fees include fees to transfer funds to an external bank account, credit card, or prepaid card. Consumers have complained to the CFPB that these fees are unexpected when they convert currencies and withdraw funds transmitted through digital wallets and other prepaid products.13

Analysis

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for a provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in deceptive acts or practices.14 A representation, omission, act, or practice is deceptive if it misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is reasonable under the circumstances; and the misleading representation, omission, act, or practice is material.15

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to reach recipients. The CFPB “presumes that express claims are material.”16 Furthermore, as noted above, the speed of a remittance transfer is often a crucial consideration for consumers sending remittance transfers.17 Recipients may rely on remittance transfers for day-to-day expenses or for time-sensitive emergencies.

As illustrated in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, marketing claims about the speed of remittance transfers may violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices under the CFPA when the actual time for delivery is longer than advertised.

In the Sendwave case, the provider told consumers that transfers would be delivered “instantly,” “in 30 seconds,” or “within seconds.” These statements were false and misleading because, although a reasonable customer might expect delivery within the time frame advertised, in many instances, transfers were not actually delivered instantly or within seconds for many consumers.18 In addition, as an express marketing statement regarding a central characteristic of the product – when funds would be available to a recipient – the misleading representation was material.19

Providers must thus take care not to engage in deceptive acts or practices in their marketing claims about the speed of a remittance transfer.

It is deceptive to market transfers as “no fee” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as having “no fee,” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer. The cost of sending a remittance transfer is a central consideration for consumers,20 and, as discussed above, fees are an important component of the cost of a remittance transfer.21 Expressly misleading price claims violate the prohibition on deceptive practices.22

For example, as alleged in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, from at least 2021 to 2022, Sendwave’s website advertised that consumers could transfer funds from the United States to Nigeria “with no fees.” In fact, consumers were charged fees on all transfers from the United States to Nigeria, despite Sendwave continuing to promote its product as having “no fees” on its website with no qualification or disclaimer.23

The CFPB found that Sendwave’s representations were likely to mislead the consumer and that the consumer’s interpretation would be reasonable under the circumstances. Although Sendwave disclosed a 1% transfer fee in the FAQ section of its website, this did not correct the misleading statement or communication made at the top of its webpage and on a graphic depicting its mobile app.24 And as an express marketing statement regarding a central consideration for consumers when sending a remittance transfer – cost –, the misleading representation about transfer fees was material.25

It may be deceptive to market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when the offer is only limited or temporary

Remittance transfer providers may violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by advertising promotional pricing for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope, even if the promotional nature of the offer is disclosed in fine print or later in the transaction.26 In such cases, consumers may not understand the pricing is limited and promotional and they may not understand that the cost of sending a remittance transfer through the provider rises after the first or first few transactions.

As the CFPB has articulated, consumers may be reasonably misled when financial service providers fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose material terms in advertising, such as when and by how much charges will increase.27 Written disclosures or fine print in marketing materials would often be insufficient to correct a misleading statement or representation in marketing communications.28 When a consumer’s first contact with a remittance transfer provider involves deception, “the law may be violated even if the truth is subsequently made known” to the consumer.29

Representations in advertising about “no fee” remittance transfers or specific promotional exchange rates without sufficiently clarifying, when applicable, that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope are presumed to be material, as they relate to cost, a key consumer consideration.

In addition, such statements are likely to be material because of their likely impact on a consumer’s initial and subsequent choice of remittance transfer provider. The impact could be particularly significant for promotions offered to first-time customers who seek to continue using the provider to send remittance transfers. Such consumers may face unexpected higher costs after the expiration of the promotion and may also face unexpected hurdles in searching for a different provider. Had they been aware of the limited promotional nature of the offer, a reasonable consumer may have chosen a different provider.

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free

Remittance transfer providers would also violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by marketing remittance transfers as “free” if they are not actually free for the consumer. For example, it may be deceptive to market a remittance transfer as “free” if the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs on consumers through the exchange rate spread for the transfer or, with respect to digital wallets or other prepaid products, if the provider imposes costs to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product.

The FTC has articulated that, under the FTC Act, offers of “free” services “must be made with extreme care so as to avoid any possibility that consumers will be misled or deceived.”30 “The word ‘free’ is a lure. It is the bait. It is a powerful magnet that draws the best of us against our will ‘to get something for nothing.’” Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 48 F.T.C. 1297, 1312 (1952), aff’d, 202 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1953).

A consumer should generally expect that a “free” product or service is indeed free, and that the seller “will not directly and immediately recover, in whole or in part, the cost of [] the service.”31 The FTC has explained that terms, conditions, and obligations that apply to a “free” item should be set forth clearly, conspicuously, and in close conjunction with the offer of the “free” item, and they should further be made clear at the outset of the offer “so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood.”32 The same analysis applies to the use of terms that are similar to “free,” such as “gift” or “given without charge.”33

The FTC has recently reiterated that representations of “free” in marketing are deceptive when the offer is not in fact free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed, such that the claim is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer about information important to them when choosing a product.34 As applied here, marketing representations of remittance transfers as free are deceptive under the CFPA if they are not actually free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed.

Marketing a remittance transfer as “free” is likely to cause a reasonable consumer to believe they are sending a remittance transfer without the provider imposing a cost to the consumer. Such interpretation would be incorrect – but reasonable – in instances where the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs through the exchange rate spread for the transfer. In this situation, a remittance transfer provider’s claim that the transfer is “free” would be false and thus likely to be deceptive because there was a cost imposed on the transfer through the exchange rate spread.35

Remittance transfer providers should also be aware of the risk of deception when marketing “free” remittance transfers for digital wallets or other prepaid products. A claim that remittance transfers are “free” may be misleading if the provider in fact imposes costs for recipients to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product. In these circumstances, marketing “free” transfers may constitute a misrepresentation of the terms for the remittance transfer provider’s services that may mislead a reasonable consumer, even with subsequent disclosure of such fees.

About Consumer Financial Protection Circulars

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are issued to all parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the principal federal regulator responsible for administering federal consumer financial law, see 12 U.S.C. 5511, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B), and 18 other “enumerated consumer laws,” 12 U.S.C. 5481(12). However, these laws are also enforced by state attorneys general and state regulators, 12 U.S.C. 5552, and prudential regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5516(d), 5581(c)(2) (exclusive enforcement authority for banks and credit unions with $10 billion or less in assets). Some federal consumer financial laws are also enforceable by other federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Agriculture. In addition, some of these laws provide for private enforcement.

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are intended to promote consistency in approach across the various enforcement agencies and parties, pursuant to the CFPB’s statutory objective to ensure federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently. 12 U.S.C. 5511(b)(4). Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are also intended to provide transparency to partner agencies regarding the CFPB’s intended approach when cooperating in enforcement actions. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5552(b) (consultation with CFPB by state attorneys general and regulators); 12 U.S.C. 5562(a) (joint investigatory work between CFPB and other agencies).

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are general statements of policy under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). They provide background information about applicable law, articulate considerations relevant to the Bureau's exercise of its authorities, and, in the interest of maintaining consistency, advise other parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. They do not restrict the Bureau’s exercise of its authorities, impose any legal requirements on external parties, or create or confer any rights on external parties that could be enforceable in any administrative or civil proceeding. The CFPB Director is instructing CFPB staff as described herein, and the CFPB will then make final decisions on individual matters based on an assessment of the factual record, applicable law, and factors relevant to prosecutorial discretion.­

This blog was originally posted on April 3, 2020 and was updated on May 5, 2020.

If you’ve been on the fence about doing your banking online or through a mobile app, now is a good time to get started as financial institutions change their branch hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online and mobile banking allow you to handle your finances from the comfort of home.

Begin online banking with a few steps

As long as you have a computer or smartphone with access to the Internet and an account with a bank or credit union account eligible for internet banking, it’s easy to get started.

Gather your account numbers

Your account numbers should be on your paper statement. Your account number will also be on the bottom of your checks or deposit slips. They are needed to enroll your account.

Find your bank or credit union’s website

Look on one of your paper statements or on the back of your debit or credit card to find the website, rather than googling or clicking on links in an email or text. If you visit your bank’s website from your smartphone, you may be prompted to download the bank or credit union’s mobile app that you can use from your phone.

Register for access to your bank or credit union's online banking platform

The first time you visit, you’ll follow the prompts to create an online account. You will answer questions to prove it’s really you, choose a username and password, and set up security features and preferences . Be sure to create strong passwords and do not use the same password for all accounts. Don’t use information such as addresses and birthdays in your passwords. For more tips on how to create strong passwords read more from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) .

Log in and take a tutorial

If it’s offered by your bank or credit union to learn your way around the platform.

What can you do with online and mobile app banking?

Most transactions can be done online or through your financial institution’s mobile app on your smartphone.

Check your account balances online at any time. You now can catch errors such as unauthorized activity earlier – without having to wait for your paper statement. You usually can notify your bank or credit union account of errors through the online or mobile banking app or chat functions.
Often, you can see deposits and charges that are pending, meaning they have not posted to your account yet. Note that for pending debit card transactions, the amounts you see may not be the same as the final amount that posts to your account. Be sure to check your bank’s or credit union’s funds availability policy before assuming that pending deposits are available for making payments or withdrawals.
Consider whether you would like to continue to receive paper versions of your periodic statements and other documents. Your bank or credit union may prompt you to go paperless while you set up online banking.
Most banks and credit unions allow you to set up automatic notifications to help you manage your account and alert you when any of the following happen: a direct deposit is received, a large payment is charged, your balance falls below a certain amount, your account is in overdraft, and more. Often, bank and credit union online portals offer you the ability to sign up to get these alerts via text, email, or both. These alerts can help ensure you stay informed without having to log in to your account several times a day.
Most banks and credit unions will allow you to deposit checks using your smartphone and a mobile app. You might not be able to deposit all types of checks this way, so check with your bank or credit union if you have any questions. The mobile app makes it easy to deposit a check in a few steps:
Download your bank or credit union’s app on your smartphone if you haven’t already.
Understand any rules your bank or credit union has about mobile check deposit.
Follow the directions in the mobile app to deposit the check
Hold onto the check for several days after deposit until you are sure it has posted to your account meaning that it is no longer pending and any holds your institution has placed have expired.
Destroy the check once it’s cleared by shredding it or tearing or cutting it up.
If you need to transfer money between accounts, or even between financial institutions, your online banking or mobile app likely offers you options to do that. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of your transfer and double check that you are using the correct account and routing numbers when making any transfers.
There’s a good chance your financial institution offers a way to send money person to person, too. Before you use any mobile payment services, check out our best practices guide to make sure your transactions are done safely. You can test it out by transferring a small amount, like a dollar, back and forth. That way you’ll be sure your money goes where you want and you receive money you’re owed.
Instead of writing checks and mailing them, you can pay most bills online or through the mobile app for your financial institution.
Banking online or through your mobile device is secure, as long as you follow best practices  for keeping the information on your mobile device safe. Your financial institution may offer additional services to help you keep your account safe, including turning off your debit card if you suspect fraud. Check with your bank or credit union to learn more about additional protections they may offer.
How do I get help with online banking?

If you run into any issues, ask for help! If you need specific guidance, contact your bank or credit union directly. Customer service associates are available by phone, online chat, or video in some cases. The financial institution staff will help you set up your account and answer questions. They will also help you figure out what you can and cannot do online or through their app. Please note that during this pandemic crisis, many bank and credit union call centers are experiencing high call volumes and may be delayed in responding to inquiries.

Helping someone else bank

If you are a financial caregiver, either in a traditional formal role of managing someone else’s money or on an informal basis, speak with the person you’re helping and their financial institution to determine what you can and cannot do. Keep in mind that even during the current national health emergency, you’ll have to follow all of the required steps to have access to another person’s account. That could include having documents prepared, notarized, or other more formal steps – and it could take some time due to the large volume of consumer inquiries financial institutions are receiving. Our Managing Someone Else’s Money guides can be helpful.

Some banks and credit unions offer “view-only” online banking, which lets you see what’s going on without having access to the money. If you are a fiduciary, you may be able to gain online access to accounts and help manage money while observing social distancing or quarantine practices.

If you do need to bank in person, call or visit your bank or credit union’s website to see if your branch is closed, offering special hours for older customers or members, offering services in person by appointment, or serving customers through the drive-thru windows only.

Bank of America will pay more than $100 million to harmed consumers, and $150 million in penalties to CFPB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

JUL 11, 2023
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Bank of America to pay more than $100 million to customers for systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account, withholding reward bonuses explicitly promised to credit card customers, and misappropriating sensitive personal information to open accounts without customer knowledge or authorization. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also found that the bank’s double-dipping on fees was illegal. Bank of America will pay a total of $90 million in penalties to the CFPB and $60 million in penalties to the OCC.

“Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust. The CFPB will be putting an end to these practices across the banking system.”

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a global, systemically important bank serving 68 million people and small business clients, and has one of the largest coverages in consumer financial services in the country. As of March 31, 2023, the bank had $2.4 trillion in consolidated assets and $1.9 trillion in domestic deposits, which makes it the second- largest bank in the United States.

Bank of America harmed hundreds of thousands of consumers over a period of several years and across multiple product lines and services. Specifically, Bank of America:

Deployed a double-dipping scheme to harvest junk fees: Bank of America had a policy of charging customers $35 after the bank declined a transaction because the customer did not have enough funds in their account. The CFPB’s investigation found that Bank of America double-dipped by allowing fees to be repeatedly charged for the same transaction. Over a period of multiple years, Bank of America generated substantial additional revenue by illegally charging multiple $35 fees.
Withheld cash and points rewards on credit cards: To compete with other credit card companies, Bank of America targeted individuals with special offers of cash and points when signing up for a credit card. Bank of America illegally withheld promised credit card account bonuses, such as cash rewards or bonus points, to tens of thousands of consumers. The bank failed to honor rewards promises for consumers who submitted in-person or over-the-phone applications. The bank also denied sign-up bonuses to consumers due to the failure of Bank of America’s business processes and systems.
Misused Sensitive Customer Information to Open Unauthorized Accounts: From at least 2012, in order to reach now disbanded sales-based incentive goals and evaluation criteria, Bank of America employees illegally applied for and enrolled consumers in credit card accounts without consumers’ knowledge or authorization. In those cases, Bank of America illegally used or obtained consumers’ credit reports, without their permission, to complete applications. Because of Bank of America’s actions, consumers were charged unjustified fees, suffered negative effects to their credit profiles, and had to spend time correcting errors.

This is not the first enforcement action Bank of America has faced for illegal activity in its consumer business. In 2014, the CFPB ordered Bank of America to pay $727 million in redress to its victims for illegal credit card practices. In May 2022, the CFPB ordered Bank of America to pay a $10 million civil penalty over unlawful garnishments and, later in 2022, the CFPB and OCC fined Bank of America $225 million and required it to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in redress to consumers for botched disbursement of state unemployment benefits at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Enforcement Action

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws. Bank of America’s practices violated the Act’s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts or practices. Bank of America also violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by using or obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose in connection with unauthorized credit cards, as well as the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z, by issuing credit cards to consumers without their knowledge or consent.

The CFPB’s orders require Bank of America to:

Stop its repeat offenses: Under the terms of today’s orders, Bank of America must stop opening unauthorized accounts, and the bank must disclose material limitations on any rewards cards bonuses and provide bonuses as advertised. Additionally, while Bank of America has generally reduced its reliance on junk fees, the bank is also strictly prohibited from charging repeat non-sufficient funds fees in the future.
Pay redress to harmed consumers: The orders require Bank of America to compensate consumers charged unlawful non-sufficient funds fees and who have not already been made whole by the bank, totaling approximately $80.4 million in consumer redress. The bank must also compensate consumers who incurred costs stemming from the unauthorized opening of new credit card accounts, and any customers improperly denied bonuses whom the bank has not already made whole. The bank previously paid around $23 million to consumers who were denied rewards bonuses.
Pay $90 million in penalties to the CFPB: Bank of America will pay a $60 million penalty to the CFPB for charging repeat non-sufficient funds fees, and a $30 million penalty to the CFPB for its credit card rewards practices and for opening unauthorized accounts. The penalties will be deposited into the CFPB’s victims relief fund. Separately, Bank of America will also pay a $60 million penalty to the OCC for its double-dipping fee practices.

On December 19, 2023, the Bureau issued an order against U.S. Bank in connection with its administration of prepaid debit cards that held unemployment insurance benefits. U.S. Bank has offered prepaid debit cards to eligible consumers in at least 19 states and the District of Columbia to distribute unemployment insurance benefits through its ReliaCard program. In the summer of 2020, U.S. Bank implemented new freeze criteria to determine whether to freeze a card due to suspected fraud. Using these new fraud controls and its expanded criteria used for freezing accounts, U.S. Bank froze the accounts of tens of thousands of cardholders eligible for benefits. The Bureau found that U.S. Bank engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by failing to provide those eligible ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders whose accounts U.S. Bank froze with adequate means to verify their identities and timely regain access to their benefits. For freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in August 2020 through November 2020, on average it took a month or longer for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. And for freezes that U.S. Bank imposed in December 2020 through March 2021, on average it took multiple weeks for consumers to unfreeze their ReliaCard accounts. The Bureau also found that U.S. Bank violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and its implementing Regulation E, by failing to timely investigate ReliaCard prepaid debit cardholders’ notices of error concerning alleged unauthorized electronic fund transfers (EFTs). The order requires U.S. Bank to provide $5.7 million in redress to consumers and to pay a $15 million civil money penalty. The order also requires U.S. Bank to take measures to ensure future compliance. The OCC concurrently issued an order against U.S. Bank addressing U.S. Bank’s conduct relating to administration of the ReliaCard program, separately fining it $15 million.

Banking in video games and virtual worlds
APR 04, 2024
Executive summary

As video games and virtual worlds have become more and more popular, gaming assets have become increasingly valuable. Gaming assets are stored on a player’s accounts and used as a medium of exchange for all sorts of transactions within these worlds, including the purchase of goods and services and person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers.

Banking and payment services that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets generally provide consumer protections, including recourse after unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds typically emphasize a “buyer beware” approach. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring markets—regardless of the infrastructure used—where financial products and services may be offered, including video games and virtual worlds.

Key findings
Gaming assets flow in and out of gaming marketplaces in a variety of ways and can have immense value. To leverage that value, financial products and services have begun entering gaming in the form of payment processing, money transmission, and even loans.
With the rise in value of gaming assets, there have also been increased reports of users losing access to gaming assets through hacking attempts, account theft, scams, and unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to traditional banking and payment systems.
Gaming publishers can collect a host of surveillance data about their users. This includes location data, social media data, and behavioral interactions, such as how a player responds to personalized incentives. There is risk that gamers may be harmed when their data is sold, bought, and traded between companies, including for purposes outside of game play.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, U.S. marketplaces have seen a shift from traditional brick-and-mortar commerce to online marketplaces. Consumers increasingly conduct commercial activity online, typically relying on the infrastructure developed by banks and payment systems using fiat currency. For instance, consumers today primarily use debit or credit cards or other similar methods when conducting online transactions. Virtual currencies are steadily becoming an important part of the online commerce ecosystem. One prominent example of this trend is transactions that occur in games and virtual worlds.

Billions of U.S. dollars (USD) are spent each year in gaming and virtual worlds, where consumers buy gaming assets1 using fiat currency and then use those assets to make purchases in-game. Some games also allow consumers to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency. These marketplaces and the infrastructure that supports them increasingly resemble traditional banking and payments systems. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to banking and payment systems.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring non-traditional markets where financial products and services may be offered, including the use of virtual currencies in games and virtual worlds. This report examines:

The evolution of the gaming industry and the revenue shift from one-time purchases of games to smaller payments made during game play.
The systems that enable fiat currency to flow into and out of games and virtual worlds and make it possible to assign and extract considerable value from gaming assets both inside and outside of the game.
How video games and virtual worlds act as electronic platforms that enable players to store and transfer valuable assets.
Recent activity by companies to leverage gaming assets and their value by providing services that increasingly resemble traditional financial products, like loans and proprietary payment systems.

The CFPB is also monitoring a number of concerning issues regarding gaming markets. These issues include, for instance, the recourse (or lack thereof) for players who incur financial losses due to theft, scams, or other criminal activity. Other issues include the proliferation of both fraud and money laundering facilitated by the two-way flow of money on these platforms, as well as the ability of gaming companies to collect an immense amount of sensitive consumer data, including data that is not only used to enhance game play but also to manipulate prices and monetize gaming in other ways. Ultimately, this activity raises questions about gaming companies’ compliance with applicable law, including federal consumer financial protection laws.2

The ability to leverage, store, and transfer valuable assets within gaming markets and the collection and use of player data to inform that market may create significant risks to consumers, especially young consumers. The CFPB expects that emerging trends in the gaming market, as detailed in this issue spotlight, will be of interest to policymakers and other government agencies with responsibilities related to the issues uncovered.

The gaming industry

The gaming industry has evolved rapidly, and gaming assets, such as in-game currency and virtual items, have become increasingly valuable alongside that evolution. Beginning in arcades, gaming originally relied on a one-time payment model, where players would pay a few cents for the opportunity to collect “power pellets” or purses. The industry soon shifted to home computers and consoles, where players would pay a fixed, up-front cost to play a game from beginning to end, collecting gold coins or “power-ups” along the way. Today, game revenue is no longer based solely on such one-time purchases. The highest revenue-generating games mostly profit through small, one-off payments known as microtransactions that are made throughout the lifetime of a game.3 The industry continues to trend in this direction, with many games changing to a free-to-play monetization model.4

Moreover, gaming is no longer constrained to just playing with people in the same room as you. Online gaming has made it possible for players to join virtual worlds with millions of other players. These types of games can include massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) games like World of Warcraft, Runescape, and Final Fantasy, which usually involve players working together to accomplish a specific goal and collect objects, experiences, or territories. There are also platforms like Second Life, Roblox, and Fortnite that offer immersive, community driven, free-form virtual worlds.5 Recent market trends, including the development of augmented, virtual, and mixed-reality headsets—also known as AR/VR/MR headsets—point towards shifts that continue to blur the boundaries between the offline world and immersive, virtual worlds.6

For most of these games, a key part of game play is having an asset, item, or currency and using that currency to buy virtual items and services within the game. For virtual worlds, items purchased are typically cosmetic in nature and used to individualize players’ avatars. Players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. Most of these games have in-game marketplaces where assets can be bought, sold, or traded. As a result, gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial payments.7

Market participants

Recent estimates value the global gaming industry at $249.55 billion in 2022.8 Global revenue for video games is expected to reach $321.1 billion by 2026.9

The gaming industry consists of many large, established companies such as Microsoft (including Activision Blizzard), Sony, Valve (Steam), Epic Games, Roblox, and Electronic Arts. Collectively, these companies earn billions in global revenues.10 The largest gaming companies typically own blockbuster games or popular virtual world platforms. For instance,

In 2023, Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard—creator of popular games such as World of Warcraft—for $75.4 billion.11 In January 2024, Microsoft announced it made $7.11 billion from gaming that quarter, exceeding earnings from flagship products like Windows.12
In December 2023, the immersive, virtual world platform Roblox averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally.13 That year, the company made approximately $2.8 billion in revenue.14

Some of the most successful gaming companies have increasingly sought to provide players with a “one-stop shop” experience that integrates playing, distributing, and storing games, as well as game assets, in one place. For example,

Valve owns Steam, a digital distribution service and storefront where players can play and buy games, as well as trade gaming assets for additional fees.15
Sony originally joined the gaming industry as a console manufacturer in partnership with Nintendo. However, in 1994, Sony developed the PlayStation, the first gaming console that used CDs instead of cartridges. Sony’s console continued to evolve over the years adding a digital media entertainment service and virtual marketplace, allowing players to purchase and store games.16 Recently, Sony changed its PlayStation store model to prevent digital download codes from other retailers, making it the sole digital game distributor for owners of its console.17

Games backed by large companies are so influential that some industry observers have suggested the odds of lower budget games breaking through in the market are shrinking.18 At the same time, large technology companies, with their vast resources, have been increasing their footprint in this space. For example:

In 2014, Amazon acquired the market’s leading video game livestreaming service Twitch.19
The U.S. AR/VR/MR market size was valued at $4.39 billion in 202020 and large technology companies have bet big on creating games and headsets to fit this technology.
Meta released its Meta Quest headset and VR game, Horizon Worlds, in 2018 and then subsequently invested $15.9 billion in the technology.21
Meanwhile, Apple launched its Vision Pro headset, which advertises the ability to “transport users to stunning game play environments and exciting new places” in 2024.22 Apple’s headset also integrates Apple’s phone payment system with features like sending and requesting money through Apple Pay,23 and facilitating online shopping.24
Gamers in the U.S.

American consumers spent $56.6 billion on gaming in 2022, including hardware and content, like game purchases and microtransactions. According to research, the typical gamer skews slightly male,25 even though the number of female gamers has been steadily increasing recently.26 Research has shown that players typically average 12.8 hours a week gaming across multiple platforms and most often play video games on their phones, gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops.27

For many young people today, gaming may be their introduction to financial activity. For example, gaming provides young people the opportunity to learn about earning currency, managing assets, and making purchases.28 Gaming companies may view young players as an opportunity to create lifelong consumers early. An estimated 76 percent of children in the United States play video games.29 The most popular virtual platform among young people in the U.S. is Roblox,30 which, as previously mentioned, averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally in December 202331 and roughly 58 percent of those users were under the age of 16.32 Its popularity is largely due to the ease in which players “can invite friends to join…different virtual worlds or games” on the platform.""33 Research has shown that today’s young people primarily turn to video games and virtual worlds to socialize with friends, rather than the draw of playing a game.34 Harnessing the appeal of socialization, technology and gaming companies have expressed their intention to market VR headsets—and as a result community driven, free-form virtual worlds—to children as young as 10 years old.35

Young people may be especially vulnerable to tactics used by gaming companies to induce spending and monetize gaming, as their financial habits are still forming.36 In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised concerns about loot boxes,37 including the effectiveness of disclosures prior to purchase, the design of loot boxes promoting compulsive spending, and potential risks to young players. The FTC also noted that the gaming industry has taken steps to self-regulate loot boxes.38 Nonetheless, in 2022, a study found that American youths’ consumption of loot boxes is on the rise39 and additional research suggests that loot box usage by children or teens can potentially lead to problems with gambling later in life.40 Internationally, regulatory efforts have focused on disclosing the odds of loot box rewards and including 'gambling-like mechanisms' in age-rating decisions.41 Within the U.S., efforts have been mostly focused on industry-wide self-regulation rather than specific policy interventions.42

Monetizing player data

While playing games, companies collect a great deal of data and information on the player. The collection of this data is often marketed as beneficial to the player and their game play, as it can be used to provide a unique and personalized experience.43 However, this data can be used to monetize game play in a manner that may take advantage of players’ proclivities to entice more spending.44 This data is also often sold, bought, and traded between companies.45

Types of data collected

As players move through a game, game publishers track their behavior. This behavior can include financial data like purchasing history, spending thresholds, and how a player responds to personalized incentives like dynamic price updates. It also includes non-financial data, like how players interact with characters and the amount of time spent on tasks.46

The technology used to operate mobile games or render virtual or mixed-reality environments collects an immense amount of sensitive player data. Gaming consoles, mobile phone gaming applications, and gaming platforms often track lifestyle and behavioral measurements like location data and interactions with games and devices,47 as well as details obtained through integrations with social media platforms.48 Viewed as a whole, this data can be used to generate an accurate portrait of a player’s offline identity, including their daily routines, home address, places of employment or worship, and who they connect with while playing.49

Similarly, AR/VR/MR headsets track a player’s movements and physical behavior to render a VR scene used to interact with virtual environments. This data includes biometric data such as posture, eye gaze, gestures, facial expressions, voice, heart rate, and interpersonal distance. Eye movement, pupil response, and gait analysis are considered especially sensitive.50 Researchers have associated eye-movement tracking with ADHD symptoms51 and Alzheimer’s,52 and this data collection poses medical privacy risks for that reason. The headsets generally also use audio, visual, and inertial sensors to detect the position and movement of a user or device relative to its surroundings. These sensors collect information about the user’s physical location, including the size of the room they are in and data on passive bystanders that happen to be within range.53

How gaming companies make money on player data
Microtransactions and discriminatory pricing

Optimizing game play based on player data is commonly referred to by industry experts as “dynamic odds.”54 Gaming companies have been using behavioral, biometric, and personal data to manipulate prices and the availability of goods or services on a highly individualized level.55

For example, if player data shows that a player is unlikely to spend money on microtransactions, their odds of earning—rather than buying—rare assets will increase. This practice helps advertise rare assets to players that do spend money. Where data shows that a player is willing to participate in microtransactions or pay more money to keep playing the game, the game will increase their prices and decrease their chances of earning rare assets.56

While some gaming terms of service state that prices of in-game items may be determined by factors that are not disclosed to the player—such as an algorithm that considers the player's available funds and cost sensitivity—the availability, value, and quality of goods, including those in the user's account, may change at any time.57

“Dynamic odds” impact the perceived value of gaming assets when their availability, price, and/or scarcity within the game is individualized and therefore the real value is obscured from the player. This use of data gives a misleading impression to the player about the fairness or neutrality of these opportunities.

Advertising

In addition to microtransactions, players often pay with their time and attention. The gaming industry uses player data and algorithms marketed as artificial intelligence or “AI” to target ads to specific audiences, making them more effective for advertisers and profitable for game publishers.58 For example, games can combine individual player location data, as well as data like birth date, age group, and gender with statistical location-based demographic data to provide advertisers with an array of audience targeting options including age, gender, family, and economic status.59 Game publishers can also use player behavior to make targeted ads more effective. For example, games can present non-skippable ads at certain intervals within the game when a player is highly motivated to continue playing. Sometimes, the player can pay to get rid of these ads. Other times, the player will have to watch the ad to keep playing or get a reward like in-game currency.60

Ultimately, this vast accumulation of data from consumers raises questions as to whether proper privacy regulations are being adhered to and whether consumers are fully aware of how their data is being used by gaming companies and across the industry. Without the right privacy protections, the data collected from gaming and AR/VR/MR headsets may be used to inform predictive models, including those marketed as artificial intelligence, and to adjust prices and game play or drive revenue growth.61

Examining the value of gaming assets

Gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial activities. In-game currencies can act as mediums of exchange that players can use for all sorts of in-game transactions, such as person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers or buying and selling in-game goods and services. These assets may be “treasure keys,” or “gold pieces,” instead of USD, but their use is functionally the same. And like the offline world, game economies experience supply, demand, and fluctuating prices.

Many gaming companies view their assets as virtual, licensed content or a preloaded currency that can only be used in their proprietary virtual world. Many gaming companies also claim that their gaming assets have no monetary value, are irredeemable for fiat currency62 and that their environments function as closed markets. However, these markets can actually be quite porous and gaming assets can have considerable value, including outside of the game itself.

This is largely due to the two-way flow of money that makes it possible to assign and extract monetary value from gaming assets. Several games provide on-ramps of fiat currency into their systems by allowing gaming assets to be purchased with USD. And, although they’re not the majority, some prominent games allow players to extract fiat currency (“cash-out”) directly from their platform63 or enable third-party systems that facilitate a cash-out process.64 Most games do not currently enable a cash-out process themselves, but third-party systems have emerged to facilitate the conversion of some gaming assets to fiat currency through various means.65 The estimated value of these assets is even tracked on public websites that show the current exchange rate of various gaming currencies to USD.66

In-game and virtual currencies

In some of the most popular video games today, players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. In-game currency is then used to buy goods and services as a part of game play, including virtual items.67 Game publishers determine the conversion rate of fiat currency to in-game currencies and the prices of virtual items, as well as the supply.68 Figure 1 below shows the various cash-in and cash-out relationships of gaming and virtual world markets.

Figure 1: The possible flow of fiat currency in individual gaming markets69

Second Life, a large and popular online virtual world70 owned by Linden Lab that was released in 2003, is an example of a game with both on and off-ramps to convert fiat currency. In Second Life, “Residents” use the Linden Dollar (L$), which can be purchased both in-world and from Second Life’s official Linden Exchange (LindeX) using fiat currency. Linden dollars act as money, as the player can use it to buy and sell virtual items, tip, or pay other Residents,71 and buy original services.72 All Second Life accounts have both a Linden Dollar balance and a USD balance, and players can convert Linden Dollars back to USD by selling Linden Dollars on the Linden Exchange. The USD account balance can be withdrawn or used to pay for Second Life services like subscriptions or fees. The USD account balance is managed by Tilia, a licensed money transmitter and subsidiary of Linden Lab. The USD account balance can be withdrawn using PayPal or Skrill. During withdrawal, a 5-percent fee is taken from the transaction total and the first withdrawal typically takes about 30 days.73 Between 2011 and 2013, third-party websites allowed trading between Linden dollars and Bitcoin.74 In 2021, Second Life reported the average number of daily users to be 200,000 users across 200 countries and a GDP equivalent of over $600 million,75 more than some small countries.76

On the other hand, League of Legends is an example of a game that does not allow players to cash-out within the game, but third-party systems exist that enable the exchange of its in-game currency for fiat currency. The game has two main currencies: Blue Essence (BE), which has no cash-in or cash-out process, and Riot Points (RP), which is exclusively obtained for purchase via fiat currency. Riot Points are used in the in-game market to purchase various virtual items that work across all games made by Riot Games.77 League of Legends does not allow Riot Points to be cashed-out within the game, but third-party systems enable the exchange of Riot Points for fiat currency.78

Virtual items, such as skins or cosmetic items

Virtual items, such as “skins”,79 are usually ornamental or cosmetic goods that have no impact on game play but have become a token of status and in some instances are considered immensely valuable by players.80 In general, virtual items are typically acquired through one of the following ways:

Earned as a reward in game play.
Bought with USD or in-game currency as a microtransaction.
Bought, sold, or traded through in-game, secondary, or third-party markets for fiat currency, other virtual items, or in-game currency.
Won in a “random chance” loot box.

Importantly, virtual items can sometimes be traded between players as an acceptable form of payment.81 For example, in the virtual world of Habbo Hotel, items are exchanged between players through the in-game market. Plastic chairs were originally designed to furnish virtual apartments. Over time, these chairs gradually became the currency of the game. Prices on the market would be denominated in plastic chairs, and the exchange of plastic chairs would allow players to buy goods or services within the game.82

Notably, the value of these skins or cosmetic items can be converted into fiat currency and certain skins reach surprisingly high value in virtual markets that allow P2P trading. The Steam Community Market is a platform-supported secondary market where players go to buy, trade, and sell items outside of individual games. Within the individual games, skins only have cosmetic use value, but on the Steam Community Market, these assets have “exchange value,”83 meaning skins can be bought, sold, or traded among players for Steam Wallet funds or other skins.84 This value can be so great that, in Steam’s terms and conditions, they even acknowledge that proceeds from these sales or trades may be considered as taxable income to players and thereby subject to applicable laws.85

Although, the Steam Community Market does not directly facilitate a cash-out process to withdraw Steam wallet funds for fiat currency,86 there is an entire ecosystem of third-party markets that are enabled by Steam’s application programming interface (API).87 These sites facilitate player-to-player trading and converting skins to crypto-assets or fiat currency, leading to even higher exchange values for some individual skins on these third-party markets, as well as the Steam Community Market.88 For example, the largest sale of a Counter-Strike skin occurred in 2023 on a third-party website for over $500,000.89

Third-party websites also facilitate a growing skin gambling industry that supports wagering skins, similar to casino chips, in virtual games such as blackjack, roulette, or craps.90 For example, a player’s account balance can be made up of skins, conventional currency, and other forms of virtual currency that are then converted to that site’s form of credit.91 Skins are then won or lost depending on the outcomes of the games.92 Third-party websites also facilitate skin betting on events like competitive gaming contests, also known as esports,93 and games between professional sports teams.94 Winnings can be converted to fiat currency or other forms of virtual currency and withdrawn for a fee directly to the player’s digital wallet.95

Third-party systems convert gaming assets to USD

Many third-party systems facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of in-game currency, virtual items, and even entire player accounts. However, third-party systems do not need to be enabled by a company’s API to convert gaming assets back to conventional currency and at the time of this report, many games make it impossible to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency without using a third-party market or website.96 For example, third-party sites support the selling of game currencies for USD from games where an API doesn’t exist like RuneScape, World of Warcraft, and others.97

To convert gaming assets these sites first connect interested buyers with sellers so they can then exchange assets within the game. The buyer then pays the seller through the third-party website and the seller can withdraw that payment in their preferred fiat currency directly to a bank account or digital wallet for a fee. Because these sites facilitate the transaction, players are able to exchange gaming assets for fiat currency.98

Figure 2: Markets available outside individual games
Crypto-asset related virtual worlds

Though their usage remains sparse, a number of virtual worlds and games exist that utilize crypto-assets—such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—as virtual items, or crypto-assets as game currency.99 The relationship between these virtual worlds and their official crypto-assets is similar to video games and their in-game currencies. Players purchase the virtual world’s native asset and use it to buy goods and services within that virtual world’s economy.

While these crypto-asset virtual worlds are significantly less popular than virtual gaming worlds like Roblox, Second Life, or Fortnite,100 they are important to note because of the prevalence of third-party crypto-asset trading platforms, users can convert a virtual world’s native crypto-asset to fiat currency, making them even more porous than typical gaming markets. Notably, some of the largest virtual gaming world publishers have expressed growing interest in positioning their virtual items as crypto-assets that have the ability to be traded outside of the game’s economy.101

Examples of these crypto-asset related virtual worlds include Decentraland, which uses a crypto-asset called MANA, and The Sandbox, which uses a crypto-asset called SAND.102 Both of these in-game crypto-assets can be used for transactions within their respective virtual worlds and can also be traded on other crypto-asset platforms for USD.103

In the game Axie Infinity, players interact virtually through digital pets called “Axies,” each of which is a non-fungible token (NFT) stored on the Ronin network. Users earn the crypto-asset Smooth Love Potion (SLP) by playing the game. Players can also “breed” new Axies by spending SLP and another crypto-asset token, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). Users can trade SLP and AXS for fiat currency or other crypto-assets on third party crypto-asset trading platforms.104 At the height of its success, Axie Infinity had over 2.7 million daily active users105 but as the number of users grew, the NFTs required to play became very expensive, leading to hierarchies of users: investors, managers, and workers.106 While the crypto-asset industry and its investors lauded the game as a viable way to earn income, reports documented the ways the gaming system exploited workers.107 The ecosystem largely fell apart in 2022 following a breach of the game by a state-sponsored hacking group.108

Conversion and purchase issues with in-game currency

Industry experts have expressed concern about the tactics game makers use to obscure the real costs of gaming assets from players.109 Games frequently use currency bundles110 to hide the true value of what players may purchase and to make larger quantities seem like the “better deal.” These pre-set bundles are often in large quantities (e.g., 100, 1,000, or 10,000 units) with confusing exchange rates (e.g. 2/3, 3/5, 5/7), rather than the exact amount needed for a particular in-game purchase or activity.

In some cases, games may also have more than one currency with different exchange rates for each currency, making the mental conversions between fiat currency and the game currency difficult. This often leads to large amounts of unused currency without any way to get it out of the game. Some players believe this is done by game makers to maximize profits as players are unable to track the exact amount of money spent but feel obligated to keep playing to avoid sunk costs.111

Converting game assets back to fiat currency within a game can lead to increased costs for players, for example, by using differing ratios for deposits and withdrawals or burdensome thresholds for withdrawal. For instance, the popular game Roblox allows players to create games and virtual worlds within Roblox’s gaming universe, as well as play games created by other users. As users move from game-to-game within Roblox, they can buy virtual items in exchange for Robux, the platform’s in-game currency. When a virtual item is bought within a game developed by a specific player, that player earns Robux. Roblox’s terms and conditions only allows players that are active creators112 to cash-out their earned Robux for fiat currency.113 Notably, while Roblox has separate ""User Terms"" and ""Creator Terms,"" everyone who joins Roblox’s must agree to both terms and conditions, essentially making all players also creators.114 To convert earned Robux115 to USD, an active creator must earn a minimum of 30,000 Robux. Additionally, Roblox’s conversion rate to USD is not intuitive. Buying 100,000 Robux through Roblox’s store costs $1,000, but withdrawing 100,000 of earned Robux only gets a player $350.116 Even with these constraints, Roblox players that are creators withdrew $740.8 million in 2023.117

Gaming platforms facilitate the P2P transfer of gaming assets

As previously mentioned, gaming assets are frequently exchanged or transferred among players through various means. These means can include gifting virtual items to other players, which is supported by games like Fortnite, Rocket League, and Minecraft.118 As well as, platform-supported secondary markets like the Steam Community Marketplace and in-game markets like RuneScape’s expansive transfer market, where individuals can trade valuable virtual items in their inventory and currency with other players.119 Gaming platforms and virtual worlds thus appear to function like payment systems by facilitating the storage and exchange of valuable assets.

Players have also found ways to recreate traditional P2P transfer activities within gaming markets that do not allow it. While Roblox expressly disallows person-to-person transfers of Robux,120 users facilitate the transfer process themselves by purchasing quickly developed items from an individual enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program, who may also be a player. The individual who receives Robux from the purchase of their item will receive 70 percent of the earned Robux. This effectively transfers Robux from one person (the buyer) to another (the seller).121 This also extends to collectives known as “Roblox Groups,” which include individuals that are enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program and who want to split Robux revenue. These earnings can then be transferred to USD through a one-time or recurring payment.122

The impact of gaming assets having monetary value

Video games and virtual worlds appear to be functioning more and more like banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. As gaming assets store greater amounts of value and their use becomes increasingly similar to that of money, the CFPB is monitoring how gaming assets are used and the associated risks, including those impacting children and the emergence of products or services that resemble traditional consumer financial products or services.

Accounts may be vulnerable to losses

When in-game currency or virtual items are earned during game play or procured via microtransactions, they are stored on a player’s account for future use. This use can include transactions within the game,123 trading virtual items with other players,124 buying products on platform-supported secondary markets,125 converting gaming assets to fiat currency,126 withdrawals as fiat currency,127 or using third-parties to convert and withdraw as fiat currency.128 As a result, a player’s account is considered highly valuable. In fact, several third-party systems facilitate the buying and selling of entire player accounts themselves, not just individual gaming assets.129

The practice of harvesting in-game currency for sale on a player account, also known as gold farming and the amount of potential earnings has drawn seasoned players to this practice as a source of income. However, as detailed below, gaming accounts often lack the security and protections of traditional bank accounts. Some of the most common scams include defrauding a player of the assets stored on their account, as well as hacking into their account and transferring in-game currency to another account.

Account vulnerabilities

The monetary value of player accounts combined with the ability to cash-out gaming assets has led to an influx of phishing attempts and reports of account theft. Attackers often use compromised user credentials to break into player accounts and access game currency or virtual items. They then use third-party systems to transfer gaming assets to another account or sell the assets for fiat currency.130 A recent study from 10,000 gamers globally showed that 63 percent of respondents feel their accounts aren't safe enough from attacks—with one in three reporting that their accounts had been hacked in the last two years.131 Industry experts consider young gamers especially at risk of phishing attempts due to their likely presence on social media and lack of awareness about social engineering tactics.132 Consumers are also potentially threatened by an emerging market of account recovery scammers that promote their ability to obtain lost gaming assets for victims of theft.133

Recourse when assets are lost

In complaints to the FTC and CFPB, several players reported hacking attempts, account theft, scams, unauthorized transactions, and losing access to game currencies and virtual items, but they received limited recourse from gaming companies. Gaming companies often take a “buyer beware” approach, putting the burden on individual players to avoid these scams and phishing attempts. They may lock or ban players’ accounts suspected of scamming and phishing but do little to provide remedy to the victim. For example, stolen items on Steam are not returned due in part to market incentives. Steam states that its virtual items' value is “at least partially determined by that item's scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy…the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.”134

Consumers have complained that some gaming companies will terminate the accounts of players for pursuing recourse from their financial institution for unauthorized game purchases. In their terms and conditions, Roblox requests users to “contact Roblox Support before disputing any charges directly with your payment processor.”135 The CFPB and FTC have received complaints from players who contacted their financial institutions regarding unauthorized Roblox game purchases. These complaints note that while they received refunds through their financial institutions, Roblox then terminated or locked their account.

When a player loses access to their account because they are accused of violating a game’s terms of service or a game is terminated altogether, the game publishers state that they have no obligation to compensate the players for their lost assets or return the money players have invested.136

Fraud in gaming markets

The ability to transfer and otherwise convert gaming assets to fiat currency or crypto-assets has led to a proliferation of money laundering137 and fraud138 on gaming platforms.

Researchers and academics have found that gaming markets can facilitate illegal money laundering.139 For example, a person can open different player accounts on several online gaming platforms, use those accounts to buy gaming assets with illegally obtained funds. They can then send the assets to other accounts within the game and then convert them to fiat currency using third-party markets. These practices enable ill-gotten funds to become less traceable with each step.140

Further, the conditions of gaming markets embolden activities such as fraudulent transactions and scams. In 2023, one firm estimated that it lost $110 million due to fraudulent transactions.141 The CFPB has received complaints regarding various trade scams on these third-party websites. In one complaint, a consumer reports that they purchased a gaming account from a prominent third-party website and confirmed receipt of the account. However, once receipt was confirmed, the account was hacked and recovered by the original owner. Per the third-party website’s terms and conditions, once receipt was confirmed, there was no available recourse for the buyer.142

Issues with third-party systems

The terms and conditions of these third-party websites can be misleading or otherwise obscure the truth about the risks involved in their services. For example, some third-party websites entice users with gaming assets, like discounted bundles of game currency or rare virtual items, in exchange for downloading applications, watching advertiser content, or submitting personal details.143 These tactics potentially expose players to risks like credit card fraud, malware, and identity theft. 144

Several of these third-party websites collect a large amount of personally identifiable information including email addresses, gaming usernames, and log data, such as IP addresses and browser information. They may also need banking information to process payments through services like Stripe and PayPal.145 Yet, these marketplaces have had a number of data breaches and hacks.146 These incidents have also occurred at large gaming companies, pointing to an industry-wide security issue.147 As these markets evolve, including functioning more and more like banking and payment systems, it is imperative that companies take appropriate data security steps.148

Gaming specific financial products

Leveraging the value of gaming assets and the amount of commerce occurring on gaming platforms, some companies have begun exploring gaming-specific services that resemble traditional financial products. For example, J.P. Morgan recently expressed interest in an “embedded payment ecosystem” for gaming, meaning a “wallet, that can serve as a central hub for anything related to a player: gaming credentials, in-game currency balances and transactions and spending history.”149 J.P. Morgan Payments has also provided strategic investment to Tilia, a payment processer and subsidiary of Linden Lab.150 Tilia was created to provide financial services to virtual worlds in the form of in-game transactions, payouts to creators, and conversions of in-game currencies to fiat currency, including USD. “Tilia is currently partnered with several virtual worlds, online games, and NFT marketplaces, including Second Life, Upland and Avatus.”151

Similar products have also emerged by technology companies. ZELF launched in the US in June 2022 as a banking service for virtual worlds with the intention of easing the transfer of money between the online world and the offline world, as well as trading gaming assets between players.152 This was done through an instant and virtual Visa credit card secured by a deposit account, known as a ZELF Account, that could be opened within 30 seconds using only the applicant’s name, email, and phone number.153 Once issued, users could deposit crypto-assets, NFTs, and gaming assets to then be converted into fiat currency.154 Additionally, ZELF’s marketing suggests that its intended target audience was Gen Z and young people.155 According to reporting, the ZELF Account aimed to provide young people the ability to facilitate borrowing against gaming assets by holding game currency in escrow and providing players with payday loans.156 The ZELF Account157 was shut down within two days of publicly launching.158

In 2023, MetaLend announced a program that would allow “Axie Infinity players to take out loans against their in-game crypto-based assets.”159 Further, in 2022, an international technology company offered a two-year loan for approximately $30,000 to a Decentraland gamer. The loan was used to purchase digital land in the crypto-based virtual world and many reports at the time referred to the loan as the first mortgage of the metaverse. In the loan, the technology company owned the land and the borrower had to pay monthly payments to use the land. Once paid, the land would transfer to the borrower.160

The role of banks and consumer finance products within gaming is evolving, but there appears to be a trend towards introducing services that are similar to traditional consumer financial products that rely on the value of gaming assets and the digital transactions that are happening on gaming platforms.

Conclusion

For several years, the most popular video games have included immersive virtual worlds that offer the storage and exchange of valuable assets. Gaming companies have created digital marketplaces that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of these assets with limited consumer protections, which has led to potentially harmful practices for players including financial losses due to theft and scams.

Consumer protection laws apply to banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. The CFPB is monitoring non-traditional markets where consumer financial products and services may be offered, including where such products and services are provided by or in connection with proprietary gaming platforms.

Additionally, the vast accumulation of data collected from consumers by gaming companies raises questions as to whether privacy rules are being adhered to and whether consumers, especially young ones and their parents, are fully aware of how their data is being collected and used across the industry. The CFPB will continue to work with other agencies to monitor companies that assemble and sell sensitive consumer data, such as a consumer's payment history, especially when this data is harvested and monetized without the user’s awareness.

The public can submit complaints about consumer financial products and services on consumerfinance.gov/complaint or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Only complaints sent to companies for a response are published in the Consumer Complaint Database. Many complaints about gaming assets or accounts are not, but complaints that are not sent to the company for response are often referred to other regulatory agencies for handling under applicable law. The CFPB will continue to monitor evolving gaming markets and the costs and risks incurred by consumers.

Consumers who suspect a scam can contact their local police or state attorney general. Visit the National Association of Attorneys General  website for the contact information of each state attorney general.

Employees that believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.

As explored in later sections, AR/VR headsets collect an immense amount of data, including biometric data and location information, to operate. This targeting of children as young as 10 years old raises concerns about the collection and use of personal information from and about children in these virtual environments.

A loot box is a seemingly randomized package of game assets where the player only knows the contents after paying and opening the package. Prior to opening a loot box, the contents are often marketed as containing rare and valuable items missing from a player’s collection, or game currency. These assets can then be sold for fiat currency on third-party websites.

“But why should we worry about using eye-tracking? Before going deep into the privacy concerns, let’s first see how does the eye-tracking data look like. Let’s look at the figure, where I plot one user’s eye gaze data as a heat map when they are browsing on an online store. We can see the two major clusters in the dense orange that represent users’ attention. The eye gaze data can be [bucketed] into two categories, fixation, and saccade. Fixations are eye gaze located close to each other, and it’s associated with users’ visual attention. Saccades are eye gaze traveling fast from one fixation to another. Users’ fixation … is associated with the regional interest in a visual scene. [Headsets] can analyze the spatial distribution of such eye gaze absolute positions to note about their attention, even subconsciously. Also, they can associate the aggregate statistic of eye gaze distribution with a lot of traits…These traits include psychological traits and physiological traits, such as implicit interest, cultural backgrounds, personality traits, health status, like Alzheimer’s or vision condition, and biometric identities and so on.” See FTC, supra note 50, at 58-59.

Rice before the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs United States Senate
APR 19, 2023
SHARE & PRINT

Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, and distinguished Members of the Committee, it is my pleasure to appear before you today to discuss the important work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Office of Servicemember Affairs (OSA) and the actions we have taken to protect servicemembers, veterans, and their families from fraud, scams, and harmful practices as they navigate the financial marketplace.

My name is Jim Rice, and I have been the Assistant Director of the Office of Servicemember Affairs at the CFPB for the past four years. I served over three decades in the U.S. Army, first as an enlisted medic, then as a Medical Evacuation Officer in the Army Medical Service Corps. I later served as the Director of the U.S. Army Wounded Warrior Program and finally as Chief of the Health Services Division on the Joint Staff. In each assignment, I saw firsthand how the financial well-being of servicemembers and their families affected their ability to focus on their mission and their careers. I also saw how many of the financial problems that began during active duty followed servicemembers after they left the military.

The CFPB is committed to our mission as laid out by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to educate and empower servicemembers, monitor their complaints, and coordinate efforts across the government to protect servicemembers and their families in the financial marketplace.1

My testimony will address the unique challenges servicemembers, veterans, and their families face in the financial markets and how we work to understand the veteran experience distinct from other military consumers and non-veterans. I will also discuss how we monitor the market for emerging threats to military consumers, take action to enforce military financial protections when companies violate the law, and ensure military financial protections are functioning as intended. I will conclude with a discussion on how we coordinate this work with other federal and state agencies, solicit input from military stakeholders, and provide other resources that empower servicemembers to exercise their rights.

Servicemembers and veterans face unique challenges in the financial marketplace
Servicemembers are prime targets for scams and expensive financial products and services

It is an unfortunate fact that our men and women in uniform are prime targets for scams and bad actors in the financial marketplace. A New York Times article from last year titled “Where an Army Paycheck is an Easy Target” profiled the environment where servicemembers are targeted by unscrupulous actors in the financial services market.2 Our younger servicemembers receive a steady paycheck, but often do not have experience managing their money. Taken together, these factors create an opportunity for providers of consumer financial products or services to target our military servicemembers for their hard-earned money.

Servicemembers also face proximity risk, as many of these businesses operate just outside the gates of installations where they are stationed. For example, when driving outside of a military installation, one common business you see on both sides of the road are used car dealers. For many servicemembers who complete basic training, their first duty station is in an area where they need a car to get around or leave the installation. The CFPB’s prior research has shown that young servicemembers tend to take out auto loans soon after joining the military and carry more auto debt than their civilian peers.3 When unscrupulous practices are allowed to flourish in the auto lending market, servicemembers are more likely to take on harmful debt.

Frequent relocation is part of military life, and permanent change of station orders often means a new home, new utility connections, and other situations where a servicemember or spouse needs to share personal information like Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and bank account information to a wide range of actors, most legitimate, others less so. As this process repeats itself, we are concerned that servicemembers are subject to increased risk of identity theft, data breaches, and other scams. These risks often follow servicemembers into civilian life, causing continued hardship.

Harmful business practices can put a servicemember’s career and mission capability at risk

Today’s hearing focuses on the critically important role that the CFPB and other agencies play in addressing fraud, scams, and harmful practices that target servicemembers and veterans, and I would like to take a moment to discuss how servicemembers are uniquely affected by harmful practices.

Over the course of the last decade, the CFPB has identified and worked on harmful practices that implicate nearly every corner of consumer finance, from mortgages4 to small-dollar lending,5 and auto lending6 to student loans.7 Servicemembers often face unique challenges when trying to resolve errors, disputes, or other concerns. For example, when they are stationed overseas, they are often unable to contact customer service representatives during regular business hours, or contact their financial institution through an app or website when internet services are unavailable.

Today’s hearing focuses on the critically important role that the CFPB and other agencies play in addressing fraud, scams, and harmful practices that target servicemembers and veterans, and I would like to take a moment to discuss how servicemembers are uniquely affected by harmful practices.

High indebtedness and shoddy debt collection practices that negatively affect all consumers may have an outsized impact on those serving in uniform. Debt collection practices often create a unique risk to servicemembers. Many servicemembers, including all officers, are required to have security clearance checks that include detailed reviews of their credit history and their ability to meet financial obligations. If servicemembers are unable to keep up those obligations, a blemish on their credit report can lead to security clearance revocation or even potential discharge from service.8 We have seen that some debt collectors threaten, illegally, to report servicemembers to their chain of command to collect on a debt.9 Too often this occurs for debts that the servicemember may not even owe.10 We have also heard stories of servicemembers who pay off debt on accounts they do not owe just so it doesn’t show up on their credit report.

Consumer complaints suggest that the top financial concerns for veterans are similar to those of non-veterans, but disaggregation is necessary to identify emerging issues

Veterans’ financial concerns, in many regards, reflect the concerns of non-veterans, and veterans directly benefit from the CFPB’s actions to address broad market problems. Over half of all complaints that we receive from veterans, military retirees, and their families reference problems with credit reporting, which is also the number one area of concern for non-veterans. This is followed by debt collection and mortgage issues, also top concerns for non-veterans.

The CFPB is acutely aware that understanding the veteran experience, disaggregated from active-duty servicemembers and the civilian population, must be part of our work to engage consumer populations and monitor markets. To this end, we routinely review veteran complaint narratives and work closely with veteran service organizations to provide important context to our work and ensure that the actions we take reflect the financial protection issues veterans face in the market.

The CFPB monitors the market to identify risks to servicemembers and veterans
We have issued market monitoring orders and collected public input to address auto lending data gaps, including gaps that affect servicemembers

The auto finance market, including the market used by servicemembers and veterans, has seen significant change over the past two years. Car prices have risen substantially, leading to larger loan amounts and higher monthly payments. These more expensive loans are beginning to impact consumer and household financial stability. Recent data show an increase in auto loan delinquencies, particularly for low-income consumers and those with subprime credit scores.11 Some consumers may even be getting priced out of the current market. As part of our work monitoring the auto loan market for consumer risks, the CFPB is piloting a new collection of auto lending data.12

To carry out this work, we issued orders to nine large auto lenders to provide information about their auto lending portfolios as part of a pilot data collection. These nine lenders represent a cross-section of the auto finance market. The data collected from their responses will help us build a quality data set that provides insights into lending channels and loan performance, and will inform potential future data collection efforts. It will also fill critical information gaps, help the CFPB identify emerging risks and opportunities, and support a more fair and competitive market.

Since announcing our intention to build a new auto lending data set last November, we have held multiple discussions with stakeholders and gathered public input into the auto lending areas most in need of greater transparency.13 These comments and guidance have helped inform how we structured our pilot data collection.

The CFPB issued a request for information on data broker practices that put the public’s privacy at risk, including the privacy of servicemembers, veterans, and military families14

The CFPB recently launched an inquiry into data brokers that track and collect information on people’s personal lives. We all see how these modern data surveillance practices have allowed companies to hover over our digital lives and monetize our most sensitive data. Our inquiry will give us greater insight into how the collection and sale of consumer data impacts vulnerable populations, such as servicemembers and veterans, who are often at a higher risk for financial exploitation.

Scammers and fraudsters can buy data from data brokers and then use that information to try and exploit servicemembers and veterans. For example, a data broker may sell a veteran's personal information to a company that targets them with misleading or fraudulent financial products, or a scammer may use a veteran’s personal information to steal their identity, open lines of credit in their name, or even target their military pension or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.

Our stakeholders tell us that some data brokers are advertising highly sensitive data on hundreds of millions of Americans, including their sensitive demographic information, political preferences and beliefs, and whereabouts of current and former members of the U.S. military.15 By examining how data brokers collect and use consumer data, the CFPB can better understand how to address these important privacy concerns and ensure that they are not violating laws within the CFPB’s jurisdiction.

We have requested public input on credit card practices that affect servicemembers, veterans, and military families

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 requires the CFPB to conduct a review of the consumer credit card market, within the limits of its existing resources available for reporting purposes.16 In connection with conducting that review, the CFPB is soliciting information from the public about several aspects of the consumer credit card market.17 Specifically, the CFPB is requesting information about the practices of credit card issuers that may uniquely affect special populations such as servicemembers and their dependents, low- and moderate-income consumers, older Americans, and students. In addition, the CFPB seeks information on the effects of population-specific protections such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the Military Lending Act (MLA). Comments can be submitted until April 24, 2023.

We are watching for possible abuses related to VA claims, or violations of other consumer financial protection laws

Congress recently passed the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 to extend VA health care and expand benefits eligibility to veterans who were exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances during their military service.18 The PACT Act added over 20 medical conditions which will now be presumed to be connected to military service dating back to the Vietnam Era, Gulf War, and Post 9/11. Unfortunately, an influx of predatory advertisements purporting to help veterans submit their initial claims to the VA for a fee—often through the guise of “medical consulting” or “benefits coaching.” But unauthorized assistance in claim preparation is illegal: only VA-accredited representatives are permitted to assist veterans with their benefits claims, and VA-accredited representatives are not permitted to charge a fee for their assistance on a veteran’s initial benefits claim. We have heard reports that unscrupulous actors have misled some veterans into paying thousands of dollars in fees.19

There have also been advertisements and commercials aimed at veterans who were stationed at Camp Lejeune seeking to represent them in litigation related to section 804 of the PACT Act, which is referred to as the Camp Lejeune Justice Act (CLJA).20 Although private litigation is not subject to the VA accreditation process (attorneys are subject to the rules governing attorneys in their respective states and courts), any attorney seeking benefits on behalf of a veteran directly from the VA under the CLJA must still be accredited by the VA.

Unfortunately, unaccredited individuals and organizations are aggressively soliciting veterans and attempting to coerce them to pay high fees—often requesting that veterans sign a contract for a percentage of their retroactive or future benefits in exchange for the preparation of their initial claims. Not only can these fees end up in the tens of thousands of dollars, but the payment terms can leave veterans with unaffordable bills for extended periods. These unscrupulous actors often insist that they are not bound by the laws governing practice before VA because they are merely “coaches” or “consultants.” We have even heard reports that these bills are being sent to third-party debt collectors if the veteran does not pay.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) applies to the activities of third-party debt collectors and is subject to enforcement by the CFPB as well as other regulators and consumers themselves. We will continue to monitor developments in this area for possible violations of federal consumer financial laws.

The CFPB takes action to enforce military financial protections when companies violate the law

Since opening our doors, the CFPB has prioritized addressing the heightened risks servicemembers face in financial markets and protecting them from the unique harms they incur when abusive practices go unaddressed. In total, we have secured $175 million in monetary relief resulting from 39 public enforcement actions that involved harm to servicemembers and veterans, including six public enforcement actions for violations of the MLA. As we work to clean up the financial marketplace by enforcing military financial protections for servicemembers, the ripple effect is that we challenge practices that impact all consumers, including veterans.21 Here are just a few other examples where the CFPB has taken legal action to ensure that financial institutions comply with existing military financial protections.

RMK Financial Corporation

In February 2023, the CFPB permanently banned RMK Financial Corporation, doing business as Majestic Home Loans, from the mortgage lending industry.22 In 2015, the CFPB issued an agency order against RMK for, among other things, sending advertisements to military families that led the recipients to believe the company was affiliated with the United States government. Despite the 2015 order’s prohibition on these and other actions, the company engaged in a series of repeat offenses. In addition to the ban, RMK will pay a $1 million penalty that will be deposited into the CFPB’s Civil Penalty Fund.

TMX Finance

In February 2023, the CFPB took action against a web of corporate entities operating under TMX Finance, broadly known as TitleMax, for violating the financial rights of military families and other consumers in providing auto title loans.23 The CFPB found that TitleMax violated the MLA by extending prohibited title loans to military families and, among other things by oftentimes, charging nearly three times over the MLA’s 36 percent annual interest rate cap. The CFPB’s order requires TitleMax to end its illegal activities and requires the company to pay more than $5 million in consumer relief and a $10 million civil money penalty.

MoneyLion Technologies

In September 2022, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against online lender MoneyLion Technologies and 38 of its subsidiaries for imposing illegal and excessive charges on servicemembers and their dependents.24 The CFPB alleges that MoneyLion violated the MLA by charging more than the legally allowable 36 percent rate cap on loans to servicemembers and their dependents, through a combination of stated interest rates and monthly membership fees. The CFPB also alleges that MoneyLion violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by refusing to allow customers to exit its membership programs and stop paying monthly fees. This case is still pending.

FirstCash, Inc. and Cash America West, Inc.

In November 2021, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against FirstCash, Inc. and Cash America West, Inc.25 On June 21, 2022, the CFPB filed an amended complaint to add several defendants, which with Cash America West, Inc. are referred to below as the FirstCash Subsidiaries. The CFPB alleges that FirstCash and the FirstCash Subsidiaries made pawnshop loans to active-duty servicemembers and their dependents that violated the MLA. The CFPB alleges that between June 2017 and May 2021, FirstCash and the FirstCash Subsidiaries made thousands of pawn loans to more than 1,000 covered borrowers at rates that exceeded the MLA’s 36% cap, as well as other violations. This case is still pending.

We are working to establish a registry of repeat offenders, including repeat offenders of military financial protection laws

In December 2022, the CFPB proposed requiring certain nonbank financial firms to register with the CFPB when they become subject to certain local, state, or federal consumer financial protection agency or court orders.26 The CFPB has further proposed to publish the orders and company information via an online registry. Larger companies subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority would be required to designate an individual to attest whether the firm is adhering to registered law enforcement orders. The CFPB’s proposed rule would help the agency identify and mitigate risks to American households and ensure that supervised companies perform their obligations to consumers.

The registry would also help unify the efforts of consumer financial protection enforcers, as well as provide the increased transparency and coordination that are critical to ensuring accountability and fairness in the marketplace. The CFPB’s proposal would enhance market monitoring and risk-based supervision efforts to ensure that the CFPB and its enforcement partners can identify previous lawbreakers and are positioned to take action to stop further large-scale harm or continued illegal efforts across the country.

The CFPB is ensuring military consumer financial protections work as intended
We’re ensuring VA mortgage servicers meet their obligations to veteran borrowers

VA direct or VA-backed veteran home loans help ensure that veterans are able to buy or refinance a home when they are ready, in most cases with no down payment. The CFPB has taken a number of steps to ensure that VA loan servicers are complying with the law, including proactively reminding servicers of veterans’ rights during the pandemic in an effort to keep them in their homes.

In October 2020, the CFPB took action against Low VA Rates LLC to address the CFPB’s finding that Low VA Rates sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgage loans that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements.27 This was the ninth case stemming from a CFPB sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage companies that used deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages. The CFPB obtained more than $4.4 million in civil money penalties as a result of this sweep. 28

The CFPB partnered with the Department of Justice’s Office of Civil Rights in late 2021 to remind mortgage servicing companies—especially those who service VA loans—of their legal obligations under the CARES Act.29 During the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly 7.6 million homeowners entered forbearance. While the majority have resumed their regular mortgage payments, during that same period approximately 1.25 million borrowers—many of whom are military borrowers—remained in forbearance programs. We took steps to ensure that mortgage servicers understood that under the CARES Act: (1) Those in forbearance were reported as “current” on their mortgages to the credit reporting agencies if they were current when they entered the forbearance and (2) borrowers in a federally-backed loan generally cannot be required to repay their forbearance amount in a lump sum payment if they indicate that they cannot afford to do so when exiting forbearance.

We conducted research on the underutilization of SCRA benefits by members of the National Guard and Reserves

In December 2022, the CFPB released a report entitled Protecting those who protect us: Evidence of activated Guard and Reserve servicemembers’ usage of credit protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.30 The SCRA allows servicemembers to reduce the interest rate for preservice loans to 6 percent. The report found that only a small fraction of activated National Guard and Reserves (collectively reserve component servicemembers) likely utilized the SCRA interest rate reduction benefit on auto and personal loans.

The report examined the overall probability that an interest rate is reduced from above 6 percent to below 6 percent over an individual activation period, provided that the loan originated prior to the activation. While data showed that some borrowers were obtaining interest rate reductions consistent with the SCRA interest rate cap, the reductions occurred in only a small portion of eligible loans. Among eligible loans that started with an interest rate above 6 percent, 9.5 percent of auto loans and 5.9 percent of personal loans experienced a reduction to or below 6 percent interest in the CFPB’s consumer credit panel-reported data. Reserve component servicemembers were shown to be more likely to obtain a reduced interest rate during longer periods of activation. Even among the longest periods of activation (about a year or more), however, the likelihood of an interest rate reduction remains under 16 percent for auto and personal loans.

Auto and personal loans that did not show evidence of SCRA interest rate reductions represented about $100 million in foregone savings. Over the approximately 11-year period we studied, we estimate that auto loans with interest rates above 6 percent that are not reduced during activations represent about $77.3 million in foregone interest savings. For personal loans, the corresponding estimate is $23.9 million.

The report identified several approaches to increase servicemember access to SCRA protections. Creditors could consider ways to apply SCRA interest rate reductions for all accounts held at an institution if a servicemember invokes protections for a single account. Enterprise-wide invocation could reduce the duplication necessary to invoke the SCRA interest rate reduction for multiple accounts and address the complexity that may be hindering utilization. There is also a clear need to explore ways to automatically apply SCRA interest rate protections. When automatic interest rate reductions were applied to servicemembers’ federal student loans, utilization increased dramatically. The low utilization rates identified in this report suggest that the automatic application of interest rate reduction benefits should be pursued where possible, and that public and private sector resources should be aligned to increase the adoption of an automatic application process. Finally, continued efforts to develop comprehensive and periodic indicators of SCRA benefit utilization could provide better and more frequent information on SCRA rate reduction utilization and help inform and evaluate future efforts to expand servicemembers’ financial protections.

While none of these recommendations are without operational and technical challenges, we believe that they are worthy of consideration. We look to Congress to determine whether or not further changes to the SCRA are necessary to ensure that servicemembers can access protections and benefits that Congress intended.

We will continue to ensure the Military Lending Act functions as intended

The MLA remains one of the most important financial protections available to servicemembers and their families. Among other protections, the law limits the annual percentage rate on certain loans to 36 percent and prohibits creditors from requiring a servicemember to submit to arbitration in the event of a dispute. The MLA authorizes the Department of Defense (DoD) to promulgate regulations implementing it, and Congress requires the DoD to consult with other regulators on its regulations, including the CFPB.31 The CFPB also supervises financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction for risks to active-duty servicemembers and their dependents from conduct that violates the MLA, and, when necessary, enforces the law. We believe the MLA and its implementing regulations have played a key role in addressing the negative effects of harmful lending practices directed at members of the military and their families.

The history of the MLA and its implementing regulations suggest, however, that those protections must be periodically reviewed to identify gaps in coverage and to prevent evasion. As we monitor the financial marketplace and engage with servicemembers and those who serve them, we have identified some areas where we think servicemembers and their families may be at risk.

For example, we have learned that it is possible to change a consumers’ personally identifiable information to obtain MLA Database responses stating that the consumers were not covered borrowers when, in fact, they were—a practice we noted in a recent enforcement action.32 In addition, a federal district court recently held that the MLA’s prohibition on mandatory arbitration did not apply in certain circumstances, a case that we believe was incorrectly decided.33 For this reason, we joined the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in an amicus brief urging the court to reverse the decision.34 Military and veteran service organizations filed a similar brief.35

I want to commend the DoD for its work in implementing the MLA and updating the regulations since it was passed in 2006. I also want to commend DoD’s ongoing work to monitor MLA implementation. We will continue to work closely with DoD and other federal agencies to share information and provide technical assistance where appropriate.

The CFPB is coordinating with other agencies that protect servicemembers, veterans, and military families
We are working with the VSAFE interagency working group to create a one-stop comprehensive fraud prevention guide for veterans, caregivers, and their families

The CFPB is proud to be an active participant in the VSAFE (Veteran Fraud Prevention) interagency working group. The goal of this group is to develop new consumer education initiatives, consolidate fraud reporting processes, and improve responses to fraud attempts against veterans and military personnel.

As part of this effort, we are working to provide resources to veterans so they can easily find and report fraudulent activities, connect with the appropriate parties, and receive assistance in resolving the issues. This resource would be a one-stop-shop for fraud-related tools and materials, enabling veterans to access a range of resources in one convenient location.

The project is led by the VA, and joined by the Department of Education, the FTC, the Social Security Administration, and the CFPB. Participants discuss best practices and work to consolidate and streamline fraud reporting processes to ensure that veterans have access to all the resources they need in one location.

Efforts are underway to combat fraud in health care, employment, education, housing, and financial products. Additional efforts to address common veteran-targeted scams, ranging from online imposter scams to deceptive home loans, are also underway.

We are developing a coordinated response to unlawful conduct targeting servicemembers.

The CFPB organizes quarterly working group meetings with the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Military Chiefs for Legal Assistance that fall under the Judge Advocates General’s Corps (JAGC), legal assistance attorneys at key military installations, and professors from each of the three military JAGC schools. The stated purpose of the working group is to achieve a coordinated response to unlawful conduct targeted at servicemembers and their families. This meeting also allows each agency to speak about its initiatives and priorities. Recent topics have included enforcement actions, joint visits to military installations, joint training, and emerging financial issues and products in the servicemember community such as allotment abuses, SCRA implementation, and military identity theft.

We are working with interagency partners to address complaints referred to us and making referrals as necessary.

The CFPB works closely with other agencies to share information about emerging issues, conduct outreach, and address problems as they arise. We regularly meet with the DoD Office of Financial Readiness and other offices and engage prudential regulators on military financial protection issues. We also share information and coordinate efforts in the states with the National Association of Attorneys General Veteran and Servicemember Working Group, and other state agencies. We actively participate in DoD’s Financial Readiness Network, the FTC-led Military Consumer Month, and just last week joined Commissioner Kristin Johnson from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and John Mose, Deputy Director of the Security and Exchange Commission’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling to discuss military financial readiness.

We also work to ensure that servicemembers can get their financial problems resolved by accepting complaints through several channels, including our website, over the phone, and through referrals from other agencies and branches of government. Since the CFPB began accepting complaints through its Office of Consumer Response and as of March 1st, 2023, around 390 veteran complaints have been referred to us by the FTC, around 960 were referred to us from members of Congress, around 220 were referred to us from state attorneys general, and around 440 were referred to us from the White House. In addition, we referred around 28,200 complaints to the FTC, the vast majority related to debt collection issues, credit reporting, and money transfers. We also receive and refer complaints from the banking regulators. We received around 760, 210, and 590 veteran complaints from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve, respectively. We have referred around 2,600, 1,900 and 1,200 complaints to the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve, respectively. CFPB staff, where appropriate, can also access the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel and view complaints related to financial and other issues.

How we listen to stakeholders to understand servicemember and veteran financial experiences.

We are in continuous contact with and host an annual roundtable discussion with military and veteran service organizations to understand policy priorities, review recent research, and better understand the servicemember financial lifecycle. In the past year, we have hosted CFPB-wide staff briefings from Blue Star Families and Military Family Advisory Network to discuss findings from their recent servicemember surveys and widely share applicable findings across all CFPB divisions. We also conduct extensive outreach to servicemember, veteran, and military family stakeholders through staff-level meetings, regular briefings on recent actions, conference participation, and presentations. We also seek to engage industry stakeholders through many of these same channels and have begun hosting dedicated industry briefings on relevant OSA activities, such as the release of our recent report on SCRA interest rate reduction utilization.

Taken together, we believe these approaches provide critical, on-the-ground intelligence on servicemember, veteran, and military family financial issues and allow us to be informed, responsive, and able to meet the growing threat of harmful financial practices targeting servicemembers, veterans, and their families.

Other resources we provide for servicemembers
Submitting complaints helps inform our work

When servicemembers, veterans, and their families are facing financial hardship or harmful practices, we encourage them to submit a complaint.36 The CFPB also maintains a video on its website consumerfinance.gov, which provides similar information. A TTY/TTD line is available, and complaints can be submitted by phone in more than 180 languages.

The CFPB forwards the complaints it receives directly to the company described in the complaint and works to get a response. If we determine that another government agency would be better able to assist, we will forward the complaint to them and let the servicemember, veteran, or other consumer know.

Ask CFPB provides military-specific resources to guard against scams and harmful practices

At the CFPB, we believe that protecting servicemembers, veterans, and their families also means getting them the information they need when they need it. Ask CFPB is an interactive online tool on our website that can help servicemembers and consumers find clear, unbiased answers to their financial questions.37 As soon as you start typing a question, the database’s autocomplete feature begins to provide various search suggestions. You can also browse by product categories and tags. We have extensive answers to important questions related to common forms of fraud, such as identity theft, money transfer fraud, and foreclosure relief scams. We also have military-specific information on some of the unique financial protections available to servicemembers.

CFPB produces and distributes a wide range of public education materials related to military financial protection issues

The CFPB also analyzes and reviews ongoing and emerging financial issues that affect military consumers to develop educational factsheets, pamphlets, and other documents to provide relevant and timely information. Some of the key financial topics that the CFPB has highlighted over the past year in our educational materials include SCRA, MLA, financial well-being of veterans, VA mortgage lending, foreclosure protections, medical billing disputes, and credit reporting/monitoring for servicemembers and veterans. Our flagship educational tool is the Misadventures in Money Management, an interactive training course that immerses servicemembers in real-life financial choices and the potential consequences of those choices.38 Servicemembers can also reach our office by emailing military@cfpb.gov.

Conclusion

The CFPB and its Office of Servicemember Affairs are proud to be strong advocates for the servicemember and veteran community. I want to thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and other Members of the Committee for holding this important hearing and for the opportunity to appear before you.

I look forward to answering your questions.

Testimony of Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Before the Subcommittee on TARP, Financial Services and Bailouts of Public and Private Programs
United States House of Representatives
January 24, 2012

The views expressed in this testimony are those of the director, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or the president of the United States.

Introduction

Thank you, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the Subcommittee for inviting me to testify about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the work of the Consumer Bureau, and I look forward to working with you and other members of Congress in the future.

I am honored to serve as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the first agency whose sole mission is making sure that consumer financial markets work for American families. As Director, I am committed to establishing the kind of productive working relationship with you and your colleagues that will allow this agency to succeed. As we work to fulfill the statutory mission set out by Congress, we believe it is critical that Congress receives the information it needs about our activities. My testimony today represents the Consumer Bureau’s 12th appearance testifying before Congress. (See Appendix A )

Moreover, we need and want to hear from you. At every stage, I believe that input from Congress will help improve our work and our ability to deliver real value to American consumers. I look forward to an open dialogue with Congress on the many important issues that affect your constituents and consumer financial markets nationwide.

Consumer finance is an enormous part of our economy, and it plays a vital role in the daily life of almost every American. The stakes could not be higher. Financial products can make life better and create opportunities for people to invest in their future. However, as we have all seen in recent years, these same products can also make life more difficult. Over time, consumer finance has become more complicated and risky, and the results can be disastrous not only for families but for communities and the entire economy. Consumers need better information about the costs and risks of their financial decisions, and they should be able to make up-front comparisons among competing products. Sellers of financial products need to know that their competitors are playing by the rules and cannot succeed by deceiving customers or engaging in other unscrupulous practices that achieve cost advantages by violating the law.

My vision for the Consumer Bureau is that it will work to make consumer financial markets operate fairly in order to protect consumers, support honest businesses, and play a crucial role in helping to safeguard the overall economy.

First, the Consumer Bureau will benefit consumers by clarifying the prices and risks of consumer financial products and services. When consumers know the true costs, benefits, and risks of competing products, they will be better able to make good decisions for themselves and their families. It will also help people avoid being ambushed by costly surprises buried in the fine print, so they can have proper confidence that the terms of the deal stated today are the terms they will actually be living with down the road.

Second, the Consumer Bureau will benefit honest businesses by leveling the playing field and ensuring that financial institutions play by the same set of rules. In the run-up to the financial crisis, nonbank firms generally were not subject to the federal supervision that applied to banks. Some of these unsupervised entities led a race to the bottom in lending standards that hurt responsible businesses, including community banks and credit unions, and greatly harmed consumers. With a Director now in place, the Bureau can work to level the playing field on which our nation’s financial institutions will innovate and compete.

Honest businesses want to compete in a market where buyers understand the terms of the deal and can compare possible alternatives. These firms work to win market share based on fair competition and excellent customer service, not through deception or fraud. The Consumer Bureau can help responsible businesses by ensuring that everyone competing in the marketplace follows the same set of fair and reasonable rules.

Finally, the Bureau’s efforts can help strengthen our nation’s economy. We have all seen how gross imbalances in consumer financial markets, most notably in the mortgage market, were a significant cause of the recent financial crisis. By creating this new agency with an intensive focus on consumer financial protection, Congress has provided an important means to ensure that such imbalances will be identified and addressed long before they produce such devastating results.

Consumer Bureau Activities to Date

Although the Consumer Bureau was officially launched only six months ago, we have already begun several initiatives to help consumer financial markets work better.

Bank and Nonbank Supervision

This month, the Consumer Bureau launched the first federal nonbank supervision program, one of the central new authorities provided by the Dodd-Frank Act. There are thousands of nonbank providers of financial products and services that make up a significant portion of the consumer financial marketplace and affect millions of Americans each year. Nonbanks include companies such as mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, mortgage brokers, payday lenders, consumer reporting agencies, debt collectors, and money services corporations. The nonbank supervision program will include conducting individual examinations and may also include requiring reports from businesses to determine what areas need greater focus. The Bureau will determine what degree of supervision to perform based on an analysis of the risks posed to consumers, including factors such as the nonbank’s volume of business, types of products or services, and the extent of state oversight for consumer financial protection.

Last year, the Consumer Bureau launched its large bank supervision program, which focuses on ensuring that banks with more than $10 billion in assets comply with federal consumer financial laws. The large bank program covers more than one hundred of the largest banks, thrifts, and credit unions in the country, as well as their affiliates.

Know Before You Owe

The Consumer Bureau is hard at work to make transparency in consumer financial products a reality. The CFPB launched Know Before You Owe campaigns to help consumers better understand various financial products by simplifying often confusing and duplicative information. Thus far the CFPB has launched Know Before You Owe projects for residential mortgages, student loans, and credit cards to improve the quality and clarity of information provided to consumers. The Bureau continues to solicit feedback to make mortgages, student loans, and credit card agreements more understandable.

On mortgages, in particular, as part of our required tasks under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is creating shorter and more useful disclosure forms for the loan estimate that consumers receive shortly after they apply for a mortgage. Our work in this area will reduce regulatory burden and make the costs and risks of a loan clearer so that consumers can choose the mortgage that best meets their needs. Specifically the CFPB is working to integrate the separate disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Over five rounds of testing prototype forms, the CFPB received feedback on the forms from more than 24,000 members of the public, industry participants, and market experts. The CFPB is also working to reduce unnecessary paperwork by combining disclosures received at the closing of a mortgage agreement.

On student loans, in collaboration with the Department of Education, the CFPB released a suggested one-page “shopping sheet” to provide students and their families with important financial aid information such as estimated monthly payment levels after leaving school. The “shopping sheet” is intended to encourage more informed decisions about paying for higher education by reducing jargon, facilitating comparisons, and distinguishing loans from other types of financial aid.

In December, the CFPB released a prototype credit card agreement that makes it easier for consumers to understand the terms and features of the product. The two-page agreement is written in plain language and explains key prices and features upfront. The CFPB is testing the prototype with Pentagon Federal Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in the country, which has more than 350,000 credit card customers

Regulatory Streamlining

The Bureau launched a targeted initiative to streamline the regulations that the agency inherited from seven different federal agencies under the Dodd-Frank Act. In November 2011, the Bureau issued a Notice and Request for Information asking the public to identify provisions of the inherited regulations that the agency should make the highest priority for updating, modifying, or eliminating because they are outdated, unduly burdensome, or unnecessary. In addition, it seeks suggestions for practical measures the Bureau could take to make complying with the regulations easier.

Office of Servicemember Affairs

The Office of Servicemember Affairs is charged with educating and empowering servicemembers and their families to make better informed decisions regarding consumer financial products and services. Under the leadership of Assistant Director Holly Petraeus, the Consumer Bureau has been collecting data and other information from servicemembers, their advocates and counselors, and industry participants. Mrs. Petraeus has already brought important attention to the unique financial circumstances of men and women in uniform and has focused our efforts in several specific areas.

Mrs. Petraeus has led the Bureau’s efforts to coordinate with federal and state agencies on consumer protection issues affecting military families. She has traveled to seventeen military installations to hear firsthand the financial challenges that military families face and has testified four times before Congress about servicemember issues. The Office held a day-long “Financial Fitness Forum” bringing industry leaders together to discuss how to better serve military members and veterans.

Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans

The Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans will help seniors navigate financial challenges by educating and engaging them about their financial choices. We have all seen the prevalence of scams and frauds aimed at exploiting seniors to gain access to their money or their sensitive personal financial information. In fact, I fought these predatory schemes constantly in my work as Ohio Attorney General. Under the leadership of Assistant Director Skip Humphrey, the office has begun holding town halls and other events to gather information about issues affecting seniors in states such as California, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Maine.

Enforcement

In my prior role, I was building the enforcement arm of the Bureau. Now that we have a Director, we have our full authorities to investigate and bring enforcement actions to ensure that financial providers are held accountable if they violate the law, and that the rules of the road governing banks and nonbanks are applied evenhandedly to all participants. In this area, the Bureau is also cooperating closely with other law enforcement agencies to avoid any duplication of work and to coordinate limited resources. The Bureau has many tools to address problems in the financial markets, including supervision, rulemaking, and enforcement. Filing lawsuits or administrative actions will be necessary at times to ensure that the law is followed and respected, and that harm to consumers from unlawful conduct is remedied.

Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity

The Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity leads the Consumer Bureau’s efforts to ensure fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory access to credit for individuals and communities. The Office’s function is to provide oversight and enforcement of federal fair lending laws; coordinate fair lending efforts of federal agencies and state regulators; and work with private industry, civil rights, and consumer advocates to promote fair lending compliance and education. It is operating in close partnership with Bank and Nonbank Supervision to develop supervisory manuals and begin fair lending examinations of supervised institutions.

Engaging with Stakeholders

One of the highest priorities of the Consumer Bureau is to communicate frequently, substantively, and candidly with a wide range of industry and consumer groups who are affected by our activities. In addition to the outreach efforts discussed above, Consumer Bureau staff have traveled across the country to engage with stakeholders and listen to their expectations and concerns about consumer finance markets and the agency itself.

Engagement with individual consumers is of course a cornerstone of the Consumer Bureau’s activities. In cooperation with other federal regulators, the Consumer Bureau has taken a phased approach to the scope of its Consumer Response function, which fields complaints from the public. This approach enables the Consumer Bureau to staff and build the infrastructure and processes needed to provide a service that is trusted, easy to use, and effective. Consumer Response began taking complaints related to credit cards on July 21, 2011, and the system was expanded to include mortgage complaints on December 1, 2011. The Consumer Bureau expects to handle appropriate complaints with respect to all products and services within its authority by the end of 2012.

The Bureau also created a “Tell Your Story” feature on its website that gives consumers the opportunity to share their experiences with consumer financial products – positive or negative. These submissions, along with complaints received through the Consumer Response function, help inform other aspects of the Bureau’s work, including policy making, supervision, enforcement, rulemaking, and consumer education functions. In addition to learning from individual consumers, the Consumer Bureau engages frequently with consumer, civil rights, and community-based organizations that have acquired substantial expertise in the consumer financial sector.

The Consumer Bureau has also been committed to meaningful engagement with industry stakeholders whose input is essential to understanding consumer finance markets and the implications of Consumer Bureau actions. From the earliest stages of our efforts to stand up the agency, outreach to smaller lenders has been a particular focus of the Consumer Bureau. We recognize that a strong and diversified financial services industry – one that includes small as well as large providers – is the best way to serve American consumers. Community banks and credit unions know their customers, can provide tailored products and services, and have built a business model based upon long-term relationships and trust. They disproportionately provide credit to small businesses. In short, their importance to our communities and to the national economy cannot be overstated. A special team at the Bureau is dedicated to community bank and credit union outreach so that we can stay continually informed about developments in their industry as well as their unique perspective on regulatory compliance issues.

Consumer Bureau staff also continue to engage with large bank and nonbank executives as well as trade associations representing financial institutions. Large financial institutions have a broad view of consumer finance markets, and their practices and products affect millions of Americans every day. A well-grounded understanding of the nation’s largest financial companies is essential to fulfilling our mission to improve consumer financial markets.

Building a 21st Century Agency

Six months from the official launch of the Consumer Bureau, we are well along the path to building a modern and efficient agency. The early accomplishments of the Consumer Bureau are the direct result of careful planning and recruitment of a top-notch workforce.

From the early days of building the Consumer Bureau, we have recognized the importance of extensive input from and collaboration with the public at large as well as our key stakeholders. For example, when designing the agency’s structure in late 2010, we provided our draft organizational chart to members of Congress and other stakeholders, and we posted the chart on our website early last year. With help and advice from many outside stakeholders, we have established an organizational structure that provides the infrastructure the Bureau needs to meet its responsibilities in the years ahead.

By creating and implementing a strategic workforce plan, the Consumer Bureau has recruited a talented, dedicated, and experienced workforce that brings a variety of backgrounds and perspectives to our work. This team includes people with significant business backgrounds, public sector experience (including transferees from other agencies), and experience in academia and non-profit organizations. As of December 31, 2011, we have hired approximately 757 employees who support operations in our Washington, D.C. headquarters and our regional satellite offices in Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. Attached for your reference is additional detail on the Consumer Bureau’s workforce. (See Appendix B )

From the earliest stages of our start-up efforts, the Consumer Bureau has worked to establish budgeting and financial controls that will help ensure that resources are deployed effectively and efficiently. The Government Accountability Office completed its first annual audit of the Consumer Bureau  in November 2011, and the Bureau received an unqualified “clean” opinion in the fiscal year 2011 audit. The Bureau is also subject to an additional yearly independent audit of its budget and operations . The Bureau received positive performance ratings in the first such audit, which was completed and submitted to Congress in October 2011. Consistent with the Consumer Bureau’s commitment to transparency, we have posted on our website quarterly updates on our budget and expenditures, including the most recent update posted this week. Details regarding the Consumer Bureau’s fiscal year 2011 funding requests and expenditures can be found in the attached materials. (See Appendix C  and D)

Conclusion

At the Consumer Bureau, we are working to make financial markets work better for consumers and the honest businesses that serve them. Prior to the financial crisis, seven federal agencies had some responsibility for consumer financial protection, but none of these agencies had consumer financial protection as its sole priority, or the tools to regulate and oversee the whole market. As a result, there were gaps in oversight and basic problems of accountability, contributing to markets that failed and an economy driven to the brink of collapse. The Consumer Bureau is now directly and singularly responsible to the public for performing its consumer financial protection functions, and it has comprehensive tools to help ensure that financial markets work for American families.

Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Quigley, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you again for inviting me to testify today about the Consumer Bureau. I have great appreciation for the important role of oversight. I believe that the Bureau must be an active participant in the congressional oversight process, and that meaningful oversight will help build public confidence in the Bureau. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the activities of the Bureau and update you on our efforts to protect consumers and improve consumer financial markets.

Prepared Remarks by Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Jump$tart
Washington, DC
April 18, 2012

Thank you for inviting me tonight. From my work with Jump$tart over the years, I know you to be a leader in improving financial literacy from kindergarten to college. So I am glad to be here with so many who share the same objectives as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

My own history with your organization has been very positive. Back when I served as a county treasurer in Ohio, my primary initiative was to collect more unpaid delinquent property taxes. And let me tell you: That kind of project really makes a person popular! Reflecting back, I can now see how actually doing that hard work brought my team and me face to face with very different categories of people. Some resisted paying their share because they had gotten away with ducking us before. Some would not prioritize payment until they were sure we were serious about pursuing them. But many people were simply “down on their luck,” to borrow a quaint but apt phrase – with the adversity consisting of unplanned and unwelcome events such as disease, divorce, job loss, or a death in their family.

People’s troubles were often magnified by their incomprehension of financial matters. Difficult situations led to bad decisions. That experience led me to form a local committee on personal finance education. We gathered information about school programs for young people and community programs for adults, such as there were, and looked to match people up with those available resources. Eventually, we became more ambitious and set a goal to pass legislation that would require every student to receive personal finance education before graduating from high school. It is not easy to change anything about the high school curriculum, but we managed to do it, with the help of a broad coalition that included Jump$tart. And what we found next was that there was so much more work to do. By this time, I was serving as State Treasurer, and we worked with the same broad coalition to develop curricula and organize teacher training in hundreds of school districts. It was hard work, but we believed deeply in it and the difference it could make for people, which made it all feel enjoyable and worthwhile.

Aristotle said, “The neglect of education does harm to the political order.” Although he made that observation more than 2,000 years ago, it still rings true today. As everyone in this room knows, the neglect of financial education can certainly help ruin the constitution of a nation founded on a regime of personal responsibility and organized around a free market, as is true with the United States of America. We see that in the personal struggles of individuals and families, and we saw it more broadly across entire communities during the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Consumers made many bad choices because very often they did not know any better. And unscrupulous businesses took advantage of those consumers.

The President has officially proclaimed April to be National Financial Capability Month because everyone should have access to information that empowers them to make the right financial decisions for themselves. In our lifetimes, we have seen a widening gap between people’s financial literacy and the ever-more complex financial decisions they have to make. At the Consumer Bureau, we are uniquely positioned to help bridge this gap. We can help consumers elevate their financial literacy. But we can also make decision-making easier by bringing choices down to a level where they are more accessible, clearer and expressed in straightforward terms.

Tonight, I want to talk with you about what we are doing to bridge that gap. But first, I want to say a few words about K-12 education, which I think are worth noting as a backdrop to the work we do at the Consumer Bureau – and the important work you do every day.

At the Consumer Bureau, we are deeply committed to a vision of an America where everyone is financially educated. But the challenges that confront us in achieving this goal are complex, varied, and significant. To face them, we must start early. We must start where all good education starts – with our children.

One of the fundamental pedagogical tenets is that education builds on work already done by others – by previous generations, previous schools of thought, even previous civilizations. People learn various things – it may be a bit of information, or a personal experience, or a concept. These things get shared and recorded. And then they can be passed on as building blocks. Through these many accretions, we gain a base of practical and theoretical knowledge that becomes ever more substantial with the passage of time. Think what it would be like if every generation had to learn all mathematics from scratch. Even just the concept of numbers would be baffling enough. Or imagine if we knew nothing of biology and tried to teach ourselves anew every twenty years or so.

I raise this point because, in our society, financial education typically seems to be an outlier from this model. When it comes to building a knowledgeable society, we make sure to teach our young people many things, but then we leave them to learn about personal finances in the so-called “school of hard knocks.” This phrase is a facetious one, reflecting that this is no school at all, but a place where people will continue to make the same kinds of mistakes that others have made before them, with the same results and the same regrets. One of the challenges to building a more financially literate America is developing and motivating a knowledge base that gets passed on to others in a more rigorous and systematic way. Leaving children to learn these lessons at home, where too often finances are a sensitive sore spot or strictly taboo, is not good enough to build a stronger future for this country.

When we do not teach children about personal finance – about managing household budgets or making informed decisions about larger investments in an education or a home – we are condemning them to learning it largely and perhaps entirely on their own, if at all. We are intent upon teaching them that worms are classified as annelids but we do not teach them why it is important to save for retirement. One thing we can count on is that when our children pass that arbitrary threshold to becoming an adult, we expect them magically to be able to operate “on their own,” and to be able to handle all the decisions (including financial decisions) that go with that unmoored status. If we teach them subjects like science, history, and math but do not teach them anything about personal finance, then we need to understand that we are making a conscious choice to release them into a financial world where they have to fend for themselves. And in the school of hard knocks, they will definitely take their knocks. As everyone in this room knows, if you do not know what you are doing financially, you can suffer years of damage with just one or two bad decisions.

So given how we have chosen to organize our society, marked by a vibrant private sector and accordingly a wide realm of private responsibility, being an effective citizen is about much more than knowing how to vote or knowing that the government has three branches. It also is about being able to have the know-how and the capacity to manage your affairs and make the most of your opportunities. What could be more important to teach in school than enabling our children to function as productive citizens? How can they exercise their fundamental right to the pursuit of happiness, as our Founding Fathers promised, if they find themselves caught up in financial snares when they try to pursue their dreams and aspirations?

In short, training the minds of the young must include training about money. This should be mandatory in every state. And for those adults who are never going to find their way back to high school, we need to find more ways to reach them, whatever else they may do in their lives.

When Congress and the President created the Consumer Bureau, they made sure to establish the Office of Financial Education for these purposes. Of course, the Bureau is still an infant and so the Office has just begun its work. But we have recognized from the outset that there are other dedicated organizations – many represented here tonight – already doing good work on these issues. We do not intend to step on anyone’s toes or add yet another voice to the tumult. Instead, we want to be efficient, resourceful, and effective.

So we will be seeking input from practitioners and the public about what works in financial education. What really works best seems to be a bit of an unknown at this point. We need to find that out – and strategize with you on how best to implement it.
What we do know is that Americans today have some of the highest personal debt levels in the history of our country. We know that too many Americans live beyond their means. We know that young Americans today are less likely to be financially capable than older Americans. We know some 23 percent are spending more than their household income, which is unsustainable. And nearly 70 percent have no rainy day fund for that unexpected setback.

We envision a world where our young people understand budgets, savings, investments, and credit. We want to see integrated curricula in our schools – where the benefits of compound interest are understood in math class; where economic costs and risks are taught in social studies class; where an essay in English class explains why we have money and what purposes it serves. Our children need to know why we have bank accounts, why we keep track of our bank balances, why we should all check our credit reports regularly.

Above all, people need to know that there are a few big moments in their lives where they are going to confront specific decisions with potentially massive consequences, such as taking out a mortgage or student loan. Do you go to school here or there? Do you buy this house or that one? How much debt do you take on, and on what terms? Do you understand the consequences? These crucial decisions have huge ripple effects in your life, lasting for years. These are significant occasions where you can make a terrible decision by focusing on the wrong things or failing to gather enough information. At a minimum, our young people need to understand which decisions are these important decisions and not to treat them casually. They need to grasp all the ins and outs, or they need to get help from an advisor they can properly trust.
So a key part of a sound financial education is learning to distinguish the few large decisions from the many small ones, and to give those decisions a more appropriate amount of consideration. We want people to look out for themselves and to get help when they need it.

Indeed, choosing a credit card, buying a home, or saving for retirement requires real financial savvy. To help elevate the financial literacy of consumers in this country, we have recently launched the “Ask CFPB” tool on our website, consumerfinance.gov, featuring hundreds of questions and answers that inform consumers about various financial products and services. You can help us by suggesting additional questions that you believe are worth answering, or by asking about answers you do not understand; either way, give us your feedback so we can improve our tool.

But we also know that many useful approaches to financial education can already be found in other places, and we have no desire to try to reinvent any wheel that is already round enough. When I was a local treasurer in Ohio, we discovered the FDIC’s “Money Smart” curriculum, and we worked with them to train people who trained others to use that excellent resource. Rather than redoing that work, at the Consumer Bureau, we are focused on the insight that there are two ways to close the gap between consumers and the portfolio of financial decisions they must be able to make. One way is to better inform consumers; another way is to bring more transparency and accountability to the financial markets. If we can bring financial decisions down to a level where they are more accessible, by making choices clearer, then we close the gap. You should not need a law degree to read a bank or credit card contract. As Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it simply, then you don’t understand it well enough.” We are advocating for greater transparency in the financial markets not to dumb things down, but to take overly complex information and make it reasonably accessible to normal human beings, so that they can make the choices that are right for them.

At the Consumer Bureau, we are doing this with our signature “Know Before You Owe” project to simplify and streamline the application forms and closing documents for mortgages. We also are showing how this can be done with our model credit card contract. On student loans, we first produced a model “Financial Aid Shopping Sheet” for students and then followed up with our “Financial Aid Comparison Shopper,” an online tool that can be used to estimate the costs of higher education and related debt burdens by evaluating schools side by side. In each instance, greater transparency makes comparison and decision-making easier for consumers.

We also understand that sometimes people need special help. At the Consumer Bureau, we now operate a complaint system on our website and through a hotline. You can send us a complaint about your mortgage, credit card, bank account, car loan, or student loan. Our consumer response specialists will follow up on your concerns and seek to get them resolved.

Our goal is to give people the confidence and the peace of mind that the financial world is not booby-trapped with pitfalls that can ruin their lives. We want to make decisions more accessible to people, and we want them to be better informed about how to make those decisions. By bringing closer together what the financial world demands and what actual consumers understand, we will bolster financial capability in this country.

It is inspiring to know that those of you who are here tonight share this conviction, and we are glad to join you in this most worthy cause.

Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2023-02
Reopening deposit accounts that consumers previously closed
Question presented

After consumers have closed deposit accounts, if a financial institution unilaterally reopens those accounts to process a debit (i.e., withdrawal, ACH transaction, check) or deposit, can it constitute an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)?

Response

Yes. After consumers have closed deposit accounts, if a financial institution unilaterally reopens those accounts to process debits or deposits, it can constitute an unfair practice under the CFPA. This practice may impose substantial injury on consumers that that they cannot reasonably avoid and that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Background

Consumers may elect to close a deposit account for a variety of reasons. For example, after moving to a new area, a consumer may elect to use a new account that they opened with a different financial institution that has a branch close to their new home. A consumer also might close an account because they are not satisfied with the account for another reason, such as the imposition of fees or the adequacy of customer service.

The process of closing a deposit account often takes time and effort. For example, closing an account typically involves taking steps to bring the account balance to zero at closure. The financial institution typically returns any funds remaining in the account to the consumer at closure and the consumer typically must pay any negative balance at closure. Some institutions require customers to provide a certain period of notice (e.g., a week) prior to closing the account to provide time for the financial institution to process any pending debits or deposits. Deposit account agreements typically indicate that the financial institution may return any debits or deposits to the account that the financial institution receives after closure and faces no liability for failing to honor any debits or deposits received after closure.

Sometimes after a consumer completes all of the steps that the financial institution requires to initiate the process of closing a deposit account and the financial institution completes the request, the financial institution unilaterally reopens the closed account if the institution receives a debit or deposit to the closed account. Financial institutions sometimes reopen an account even if doing so would overdraw the account, causing the financial institution to impose overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees. Financial institutions may also charge consumers account maintenance fees upon reopening, even if the consumers were not required to pay such fees prior to account closure (e.g., because the account previously qualified to have the fees waived).

In addition to subjecting consumers to fees, when a financial institution processes a credit through an account that has reopened, the consumer’s funds may become available to third parties, including third parties that do not have permission to access their funds.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has brought an enforcement action regarding the practice of account reopening under the CFPA’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.1 The CFPB found that a financial institution engaged in an unfair practice by reopening deposit accounts consumers had previously closed without seeking prior authorization or providing timely notice. This practice of reopening closed deposit accounts caused some account balances to become negative and potentially subjected consumers to various fees, including overdraft and NSF fees. In addition, when the financial institution reopened an account to process a deposit, creditors had the opportunity to initiate debits to the account and draw down the funds, possibly resulting in a negative balance and the accumulation of fees. These practices resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees charged to consumers. The CFPB concluded that the institution’s practice of reopening consumer accounts without obtaining consumers’ prior authorization and providing timely notice caused substantial injury to consumers that was not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by any countervailing benefit to consumers or to competition.

Analysis

A financial institution’s unilateral reopening of deposit accounts that consumers previously closed can constitute a violation of the CFPA’s probation on unfair acts or practices.2

Under the CFPA, an act or practice is unfair when it causes or is likely to cause consumers substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers and the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.3

Unilaterally reopening a closed deposit account to process a debit or deposit may cause substantial injury to consumers.

Substantial injury includes monetary harm, such as fees paid by consumers due to the unfair practice. Actual injury is not required; significant risk of concrete harm is sufficient.4 Substantial injury can occur when a small amount of harm is imposed on a significant number of consumers.5

After a consumer has closed a deposit account, a financial institution’s act of unilaterally reopening that account upon receiving a debit or deposit may cause monetary harm to the consumer. Financial institutions frequently charge fees after they reopen an account. For example, consumers may incur penalty fees6 when an account that they closed is reopened by the financial institution after receiving a debit or deposit. Since financial institutions typically require a zero balance to close an account, reopening a closed account to process a debit is likely to result in consumers incurring penalty fees.

In addition to fees, reopening a consumer’s account to accept a deposit increases the risk that an unauthorized third party may gain access to the consumer’s funds (e.g., a person with the consumer’s account information who pulls funds from the account without the consumer’s authorization).

And if reopening the account overdraws the account and the consumer does not repay the amount owed quickly, the financial institution may furnish negative information to consumer reporting companies, which may make it harder for the consumer to obtain a deposit account in the future. Because reopening accounts that the consumer closed gives rise to these risks of monetary harm, this practice may cause substantial injury.

Consumers likely cannot reasonably avoid this injury.

An injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers when consumers cannot make informed decisions or take action to avoid that injury. Injury that occurs without a consumer’s knowledge or consent, when consumers cannot reasonably anticipate the injury, or when there is no way to avoid the injury even if anticipated, is not reasonably avoidable.7

Consumers often cannot reasonably avoid the risk of substantial injury caused by financial institutions’ practice of unilaterally reopening accounts that consumers previously closed because they cannot control one or more of the following circumstances: a third party’s attempt to debit or deposit money, the process and timing of account closure, or the terms of the deposit account agreements.

First, without the consumer’s consent or knowledge, a third party may attempt to debit from or deposit to the closed account, prompting their previous financial institution to reopen the account. For example, a payroll provider may inadvertently send a consumer’s paycheck to the closed account, even if the consumer informed the payroll provider about the account closure and directed them to deposit their paycheck in a new account. Similarly, a merchant may take an extended amount of time to process a refund to a customer’s account for a returned item or may use the wrong account information to process a recurring monthly payment. Consumers cannot reasonably avoid these types of injuries resulting from these types of actions by a third party.

Second, financial institutions may require consumers to complete a multi-step process before closing a deposit account, which can involve completing paperwork in person, returning or destroying any access devices, bringing the balance to zero, and fulfilling waiting periods. When consumers begin this process, they likely will not know exactly when the financial institution will fulfill their request to close the account. Consumers, for example, do not control waiting periods or the length of time it takes a financial institution to settle transactions to bring a balance to zero. Consumers’ lack of control over the financial institution’s account closure process and timeline may make it more difficult for them to prevent debits and credits that will reopen the account, since the account may close earlier than they expect.

Finally, consumers may not have a reasonable alternative to financial institutions that permit this practice because most deposit contracts either permit or are silent on this practice. Further, to the extent that deposit account agreements allow or disclose such practices, these agreements typically are standard-form contracts prepared by financial institutions that specify a fixed set of terms.8 Consumers have no ability to negotiate the terms of these agreements. Instead, financial institutions present these contracts to consumers on a take-or-leave-it basis. Thus, even if deposit account agreements reference this practice, consumers also have limited ability to negotiate the terms of such contracts, and consumers can incur injuries in circumstances beyond their control. Moreover, even if the financial institution informs the consumer at the time that the account is closed that the institution may reopen the account, pursuant to the account agreement, the consumer will still generally lack the practical ability to control whether the account will be reopened and to avoid fees and other monetary harms.

This injury is likely not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Reopening a closed account does not appear to provide any meaningful benefits to consumers or competition. To the extent financial institutions are concerned about controlling their own costs to remain competitive, they have alternatives to reopening a closed account upon receiving a debit or deposit that could minimize their expenses and liability. For example, the financial institution could decline any transactions that they receive for accounts consumers previously closed. In addition to minimizing the institution’s costs, not reopening these accounts may protect the financial institution against the use of closed accounts to commit fraud.

Moreover, consumers do not generally benefit when a financial institution unilaterally reopens an account that consumers previously closed. Since financial institutions typically require consumers to bring the account balance to zero before closing an account, reopening an account in response to a debit will likely result in penalty fees rather than payment of an amount owed by the consumer. While consumers might potentially benefit in some instances where their accounts are reopened to receive deposits, which then become available to them, that benefit does not outweigh the injuries that can be caused by unilateral account reopening. Such benefits are unlikely to be significant because consumers can generally receive the same deposits in another way that they would prefer (such as through a new account that they opened to replace the closed account). And those uncertain benefits are outweighed by the risk that deposited funds will be depleted before the consumer can access (or is even aware of) the funds (e.g., through maintenance or other fees assessed by the financial institution as a result of the reopening or debits from the reopened account by third parties).

Further, not reopening accounts may benefit consumers in certain circumstances. For example, declining a deposit submitted to a closed account alerts the fund’s sender that they have incorrect account information and may encourage the sender to contact the consumer to obtain updated account information. Declining a debit also provides an opportunity for the sender of the debit to inform the consumer of any erroneous account information, providing the consumer with the opportunity to make the payment with a current account or through another process.

For these reasons, government enforcers should consider whether a financial institution has violated the prohibition against unfair acts or practices in the CFPA if they discover that a financial institution has unilaterally reopened accounts that consumers previously closed.

Risks of Solar-Specific Loans
Conclusion
Executive Summary

The market for residential solar panels continues to grow, in large part due to declining solar panel costs and increased government incentives, including tax credits. With that growth, the marketing and door-to-door sales of solar-related financial products have become more prevalent.

This Issue Spotlight provides an overview of the most common solar financing business models. Due to the size of the marketplace and the scope of potential consumer harm, this spotlight pays specific attention to risks stemming from the presentation and structure of “solar-specific” loans, which are often facilitated by large financial technology (“fintech”) firms via a point-of-sale partnership with solar installers.

Consumer Risks
Hidden markups and fees. The CFPB has found that some lenders include substantial markups and fees that can increase the loan principal by 30 percent or more above the cash price. Lenders frequently bake these fees (commonly referred to within the industry as “dealer fees”) into the loan principal but often do not indicate that these fees are a markup from the total cash price that consumers pay for the system installation.
Misleading statements concerning federal tax credits. Many solar loan sales pitches promote the 30 percent federal “Investment Tax Credit” for residential solar installations with a presumption of universality. However, the tax credit is not a guarantee—it depends on the consumer’s federal tax liability. Compounding the potential harm are solar loan marketing materials that deduct the presumed tax credit from the loan amount to present a so-called “net cost.” This framing can hide the true cost of the loan by leading consumers to believe that the “disclosed net cost” is in fact the loan principal. Low-income consumers are less likely to receive a tax credit and therefore more likely to face unexpected costs.
Misrepresentations and omissions concerning “voluntary” prepayments. Many solar loans are structured to increase the required monthly payment unless the borrower prepays a large share of the loan principal—typically 30 percent, which is the presumptive amount of the federal tax credit. However, many consumers are surprised by the prepayment expectation, do not receive the presumptive amount of the tax credit, or will not have the funds to remit that prepayment. As a result, they will face large increases to their monthly payments.
Misrepresentations regarding financial benefits. While households can generate substantial savings from solar energy installation, the CFPB identified misleading statements and marketing materials. Consumers report being told that solar panels will not only cover the cost of the financing but also eliminate future energy bills, when the actual financial benefits are uncertain and can vary significantly by geographic location and season, among other factors.
Market Overview
Scope

The market for solar-powered electricity in the United States continues to expand, with a corresponding growth in financing methods. This Issue Spotlight addresses the most common methods for financing the cost of residential solar panels. It includes descriptions of loans and leases for at-home rooftop solar installations, along with an overview of the market for community solar, an option for solar energy located away from the consumer's residence.1

Market Summary

Industry reports state that in 2023, solar energy represented 55 percent of new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid, up from 44 percent in 2022, 23 percent in 2018, and 4 percent in 2010.2 The residential segment, approximately one fifth of the overall solar market, installed 6.8 direct-current gigawatts of solar capacity in 2023—up 13 percent from 2022 and 62 percent from 2021.3

A major driver of this growth is the falling cost of solar panels. According to one study from an alternative energy marketplace, the median nationwide installation cost of residential solar panels fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.80 in 2023.4

Federal legislation encouraging the adoption of solar energy has also contributed to the heightened demand. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act created a new tax credit (often referred to as the “Investment Tax Credit”) specifically tied to the installation of residential solar projects.5 Eligible homeowners can use the credit to reduce their federal income tax liability by a certain percentage of the project’s installation cost. The size of the credit has varied over time based on subsequent legislation, never exceeding 30 percent. The credit is also non-refundable, meaning that if the potential credit exceeds a person’s federal tax liability, they can only claim enough to reduce their liability to zero. Individuals or households with no federal tax liability will not be able to claim any of the tax credit.

The Investment Tax Credit was set to expire at the end of 2024, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 renewed it through 2034. From 2022 through 2032, the value of the tax credit will be 30 percent of the solar panels’ installation cost, before dropping to 26 percent in 2033 and 22 percent in 2034.6

Many private lenders and their sales partners have made tax benefits a staple of their marketing and customer acquisition strategies. As described in the next section, lenders can exaggerate or double count these benefits in ways that are potentially misleading.

Another source of recent notable solar-related federal subsidies is the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund: $27 billion directed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for “mobilizing financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- and air pollution-reducing projects in communities across the country.”7 A portion of the program’s funds will address the residential solar market, though the specifics are the purview of the over 60 grant recipients that were finalized in April 2024.8

Analysis from researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, provides insight into the income and demographic trends of consumers who purchased residential solar panels.9 The researchers found that approximately 45 percent of solar adopters in 2022 had incomes below 120 percent of their area median income, with 23 percent of adopters falling below 80 percent of area median income. They also found that “[s]olar adoption continues to shift toward less affluent households, with the median current income of solar adopters dropping from $140k for households that installed systems in 2010 to $117k in 2022.” While overall solar adopters are more likely to identify as non-Hispanic white, Berkeley Lab found that among owner-occupied households, “minority households collectively have a greater propensity to adopt [residential solar panels] than non-Hispanic White households.”10

Solar Financing Models

Consumers can access solar energy either directly, via at-home rooftop installations, or indirectly, via largescale community solar projects located away from individual homeowners’ property. The at-home rooftop installation market is available almost exclusively to homeowners, while community solar projects are often open to both homeowners and renters. Within those two broad categories, consumers have several options for securing loans and leases to defray the upfront costs of solar energy.11

At-home rooftop installations

Consumers who wish to avoid paying the cost of installation of solar panels on their rooftops upfront can purchase the panels with a loan or rent the panels. These options are popular because of the high sticker cost: the average residential solar panel installation costs approximately $25,000.12 Another industry report found that cash purchases comprised just 19 percent of the at-home residential solar market in 2023, with loans accounting for 58 percent and third-party ownership 23 percent.13

In many instances, at-home solar panels are designed to allow the homeowner to receive the “net metering” benefits of selling the solar energy they create back to the electrical grid and reduce their monthly electricity bill.14 “In effect,” per the U.S. Department of Energy, “the customer uses excess generation to offset electricity that the customer otherwise would have to purchase at the utility’s full retail rate.”15 However, net metering is not available in all jurisdictions and, where available, it can have terms and conditions that reduce the value to residential utility customers.16

Consumers who purchase solar panels (either with cash or a loan) may be eligible for two additional financial benefits. The first are tax credits, most notably the federal Investment Tax Credit described in Section 2.2. The second is the Solar Renewable Energy Certificate program, in which utility companies pay homeowners for every megawatt hour17 of solar energy that their panels generate. Solar Renewable Energy Certificates only exist in jurisdictions with specific requirements in their state renewable standards for how much energy must come from renewable sources. Certain jurisdictions require utilities to purchase solar credits from home and business owners that “count” toward those standards.18

SOLAR-SPECIFIC LOANS

The most common form of solar financing consists of fixed-term, usually fixed-rate installment loans that cover the price of the panels and installation. These loans are typically referred to as private because they are not issued by a federal or state agency.

There are several types of private loans for solar installations. The first is a loan from a lender who specializes in solar finance (“solar-specific loan”), which is often offered with the panel installation contract and includes provisions unique to the solar industry. Other options include general-purpose unsecured installment loans, lines of credit, and home equity loans and lines from banks, credit unions, and nonbank financial technology firms.

This Issue Spotlight focuses on solar-specific loans due to their complex presentation and structure. The distinctions from other loan options begin at the initial point of contact. For general-purpose loans and home equity financing, there is typically a clear dividing line between the financing contract and the installation contract. For solar-specific loans, the sales, installation, and financing often blend into a single interaction, as salespersons, installers, and lenders may work in concert to consummate the sale of a solar system and financing.

Solar salespeople commonly make their first contact with potential customers via a door-to-door introduction.19 The solar salespeople and installers often have agreements between each other, as well as agreements with one or more solar-specific lenders that enable instantaneous loan offers with the installation contract via a digital tablet.

Some of the largest solar-specific private lenders are fintech firms that offer near-nationwide coverage via partnerships with one or more banks to originate their loans. An online industry marketplace that pairs consumers with installers and lenders states that the largest fintech solar lenders by financing quotes offered in H2 ’23 were Solar Mosaic, Inc. (via partner banks Truist, WebBank, DCU, and Connexus), ATMOS Financial Services Inc. (via partner bank Five Star Bank), Dividend Finance Inc. (acquired by Fifth Third Bancorp in 2022), Sunlight Financial LLC (via partner bank Cross River Bank), and EnFin Co. (via partner banks Hatch Bank and EnFin Corp.).20 The report notes a “fragmented” market, with no one lender comprising more than 12 percent of the financing quotes.21 Two years prior, a pair of lenders (Sunlight and Mosaic) collectively captured over 30 percent of the market.22

The stated annual percentage rates (APRs) on solar-specific loans typically range from 1 to 7 percent. However, as discussed later, those APRs often do not include fees that increase the loan principal on top of the cash price of the solar panels.

Solar-specific loan term lengths typically range from 8 to 25 years, but industry data show solar loans are typically repaid in 7 to 9 years due to prepayments.23 Some solar loans are secured by collateral (typically with a lien on the panels themselves), while others are unsecured. As is the case in other consumer lending, secured loans usually come with lower APRs than comparable unsecured loans because the lender has the right to repossess the panels in cases of nonpayment.

If the homeowner sells their home before their solar loan is paid off, they typically have two options that leave the panels with the home: the buyer agrees to legally assume the solar loan if permitted by the lender, or the homeowner pays off the remaining solar loan balance prior to the sale of the home. It is not typical for homeowners to move their panels to a new home due to the potential for damaging the panels or the house.

GOVERNMENT-BACKED LOANS

There are several existing federal- and state-sponsored loan programs to finance residential solar projects.24 In some cases, tax dollars directly subsidize the program and pass those benefits along to consumers in the form of lower interest rates. Three existing federal programs are:

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)’s Solar and Wind Technologies program, which is an amendment to a mortgage at the time of purchase that adds the full cost of the solar panel installation to a regular FHA-insured mortgage.
The FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs Energy Efficient Mortgage program, which is a refinance of a mortgage to include an eligible energy efficient upgrade.
The FHA’s PowerSaver program, which is a second mortgage just for energy-efficient upgrades. Loan sizes range up to $25,000 and up to 20 years at rates of 5 to 10 percent, with the FHA guaranteeing up to 90 percent of the loan.
LEASE

In a lease, sometimes referred to in the industry as a “straight solar lease,” the homeowner enters into a contract—either directly with the installer of solar panels or with a third-party lessor—to lease solar panels for a fixed period of time rather than purchase them outright.

Typical solar leases last for 15 to 20 years and require no down payment. In some cases, monthly payments are the same for the life of the lease, but in many cases the payments increase each year by a predetermined amount. The homeowner is still responsible for their standard monthly electricity bills, but they benefit from the solar net metering (if available in their jurisdiction) in many of the same ways as homeowners who choose to purchase the panels. At the end of the lease, the lessor is responsible for uninstalling and removing the panels.

POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Like solar leases, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are another option in which consumers can benefit from rooftop solar energy without bearing the panel ownership responsibility. PPAs also involve an upfront long-term contract between the consumer and a lessor/installer, but the terms differ from a lease in important ways.

In a PPA, the installer is responsible for setting up and maintaining the solar system on the consumer’s rooftop and for providing electricity to the consumer at a predetermined per-kilowatt-hour rate. This model is known as “paying for energy,” since the consumer pays the installer for the electricity they consume rather than a fixed cost for the panels. In some PPA contracts, the rate is fixed for the duration of the agreement. In others, there are delineated “escalators” that increase the rate in future years and range from 1 to 5 percent.25 Typical PPA contract lengths are six to twenty-five years.26

Community Solar

Community solar has many different forms and business models. The term applies to any agreement between an individual and a third party to finance a large-scale solar project (often called a “solar farm”) situated away from the consumer’s home.27

Community solar enables renters and residents in multi-family homes and apartment buildings to invest in and benefit from renewable electricity. This essentially doubles the potential addressable market for residential solar energy. According to a 2015 National Renewable Energy Laboratory study, “over 50 percent of Americans who would like to use solar energy are unable to install a rooftop solar array.”28 Some community solar business models provide consumers with fixed discounts from their retail electricity bills, while others charge based on individual energy consumption.

Industry reports found that community solar installation volumes (as measured on a per-megawatt basis) stayed relative constant between 2022 and 2023; the lack of growth was attributed to “[i]nterconnection delays and permitting challenges.”29 In 2023, community solar installation volumes were roughly one-sixth the size of at-home residential solar installation volumes.30

Risks of Solar-Specific Loans

There are several consumer risks that apply specifically to private solar-specific loans. Some risks may stem from aggressive sales tactics, but the underlying loan contracts have the potential for consumer harm as well. Four of the most prominent risks are described below. The section concludes with a review of specific consumer populations with the potential for heightened risk.

Hidden Markups and Fees

Many solar-specific lenders assess hidden fees that increase the amount of the loan principal above the cash price. Within the solar industry, these fees are often called “‘program fees,’ ‘lending fees,’ ‘finance fees,’ ‘platform fees,’ ‘original issue discounts,’ and ‘dealer fees.’”31 Hidden fees typically range from between 10 to 30 percent of the cash price but can exceed 50 percent.32

As an example, consider a solar project that would cost $30,000 if the consumer paid in cash (“cash price”), with a $9,000 hidden fee (30 percent of the cash price).

The loan documents would show a loan principal of $39,000 plus interest. The lender would remit the $30,000 cash price to the installer and keep the $9,000 hidden fee. Typically, lenders do not include the hidden fees in the total costs of credit that they present to consumers, and salespeople offering financing often do not explain the difference in the cash price and loan principal.

Consumers' and market participants’ experiences reveal several concerns about hidden fees.33 The following complaints to the CFPB illustrate these concerns.

""I'm currently working with a solar rooftop installer that is offering financing by [LENDER NAME]. The solar installer is saying that if I would like to have financing through this company, that they have to add on 26% of the total cost of the system as an upfront fee. This is a fee that the [LENDER NAME] retains, and not the dealer fee, although it is called a "" dealer fee ''. I confirmed this through many different solar installers that utilized this finance company. I called the company directly to ask for the APR and they said they do not have one. Normally when I [either] apply for or inquire about any loan, the federal government requires the percentage rate be listed, as well as the APR which is the percentage rate plus any fees or charges in relation to the loan. This federal requirement is so that the consumer will know exactly what they are spending on debt service. [LENDER NAME] refused to provide the APR, and instead, they stated that their APR was the interest rate. This meant that they were saying that the interest rate was 1.99 %, and that the APR interest rate was also 1.99 % for a 25 year loan. Mathematically this can not be possible when they are charging a 26 % upfront fee, again called the dealer fee... They are not living up to the spirit or letter of the law and are blatantly lying to the consumer…When I talked with [LENDER NAME], their managerial representation was very angry that I was even asking these questions and seemed shady."" 34




""[LENDERS] pass off HIGH percentage origination charges to the contractor to avoid QC problems of disclosing that as a loan cost is also the point of XXXX I believe…My loan amount was XXXX, so they increased my loan amount to XXXX. I asked the contract how and why and they said [LENDER NAME] added charges to the contractor knowing it would be passed to the consumer."" 35

Some industry stakeholders oppose the use of hidden fees and have combined resources to propose alternative financing solutions.36 They offer loans that do not include a markup on the solar panels’ cash price and instead price all costs of credit into the APR. However, they acknowledge that even when their all-in costs are actually lower, it is difficult to compete for consumers’ business when their disclosed costs of credit are higher than those advertised by lenders who charge hidden fees.

Misleading Statements Concerning Federal Tax Credits

Lenders and installers often incorporate the default expectation of a 30 percent federal tax credit into their marketing materials and loan documentation, giving a potentially misleading impression of the overall price.

A common solar lending industry practice is to present the actual loan in a small, light font, and the “net system cost” (i.e., the loan amount minus the presumed 30 percent tax benefit) in a large, bright font. Consumers may not be familiar with using a tax credit to pay off a portion of a loan and may not fully understand that the actual loan amount is displayed in the smaller, gray font. Often, lenders and installers place disclaimers on the “expected tax credits” in the fine print of consumer agreements or footnotes of advertisements, but these disclaimers may not be obvious enough for consumers to notice.

Promising specific tax savings up front is problematic because lenders and installers seldom if ever know the consumer’s tax situation. This creates at least three problems: First, the credit is not issued until the consumer files federal taxes for the year in which solar project is installed. A consumer who purchased panels in January 2024, for example, may not receive any tax benefit until they file their 2024 taxes in 2025. Second, only higher-income consumers will typically have the requisite federal tax liability to receive the full tax credit. Third, even consumers who do receive the full tax credit may not see any or all those funds in the form of a refund check if their other tax liabilities are large enough that the solar panel credit only reduces their overall taxes owed.

Misrepresentations and Omissions Concerning Prepayments

Unlike some consumer loans that impose prepayment penalties for early repayment, many solar-specific loans effectively require consumers to make substantial partial prepayments. These lenders rely on consumers’ presumptive federal tax credits as the basis for requiring partial loan prepayments.

It is commonplace for solar-specific loans to re-amortize at a higher monthly payment amount at the 19th month of the loan term if the consumer does not make a substantial prepayment before then. Frequently, the necessary prepayment to avoid that re-amortization is 30 percent of the loan principal, which is the current size of the federal Investment Tax Credit.

There are at least two sets of risks and potential harms inherent in this “expected prepayment” practice. First, some consumers have asserted that prepayment was not clearly discussed at the time that they signed the loan documents. Even in instances when the different payment amounts are discussed, the often quick and digital nature of the sales process increases the likelihood that salespeople may guide consumers past these sections. A 2024 investigative report into the industry found that “[c]onsumers don’t catch these extra costs in part because salespeople often present documents to potential customers on tablets or phones, making it easy to skip over the fine print.”37 The report quoted an attorney representing consumers in several civil suits against solar lenders who argued that “finance companies are well aware that salesmen are taking advantage of electronic devices to hide documents from consumers.”38

The second set of risks and potential harms inherent in the “expected prepayment” practice pertains to the payment expectations. As discussed in prior sections, there is no guarantee that all consumers will receive the full federal tax credit or that they will receive a cash refund equal to the size of the full credit. Consumers who do not receive the full 30 percent tax credit as a cash refund and are unable to remit the full expected prepayment will experience a sudden and significant increase in their monthly payment. Those who do receive the full tax credit but are not aware of the prepayment expectation may allocate funds to other financial obligations and thus not have the ability to make the prepayment necessary to prevent the higher payment re-amortization.

The following complaints to the CFPB exemplify these risks.

""The [LENDER NAME] company stated I signed some [loan agreement] that gave me 18 months to accumulate enough solar tax credits to avoid a 26 % fee based on the loan amount {$34000.00}, which they say comes to {$9000.00} and if I do not send a check by XX/XX/XXXX my payment will go from {$180.00} to {$250.00} for 38 years this will mean that I will be paying {$64000.00} for solar panels over 38 years. I did not understand this from the beginning, I was literally e-signing and it was not explained to me, the new loan amount of {$250.00} is {$65.00} additional per month and over 38 year loan will add {$29000.00} to the {$34000.00} loan amount."" 39




""My payment was as expected for a while. Soon I received notice that because my loan balance hadn't fallen below a certain amount, my payment would increase to $ XXXX -- this despite me paying every payment on time for the last XXXX months per the contract ( via autopay ). Over the course of the last XXXX years I have paid only {$2700.00} in principal. I was never informed that I would need to make any additional payments ( on top of my regular installment payments ), nor that if I didn't make additional payments I would also have a greatly increased payment."" 40
Misrepresentations of Financial Benefits

Despite various claims, there is no guarantee that a solar loan will pay for itself—especially when considering the substantial upfront fees included with some solar-specific loans. Some installers misrepresent the future cost of energy and overestimate the amount of electricity that solar panels will produce. Some solar loan agreements note that the consumer’s financial obligation does not depend on the system’s performance, yet many factors can impact a system’s performance, including system design, component quality, installation failures, weather, local rate design, tree growth and other variables.

Population-Specific Risks

Consumers and others have expressed concern to the CFPB about high-pressure and misleading solar sales practices and financing impacting particular populations, including those who are older adults or have limited English proficiency.

The following solar-loan-related complaints to the CFPB from older adults illustrate some of these concerns.

""I was told that I wouldn't have to pay an electric bill and now I pay more on my electric bill with the solar panels. They lied to me and took advantage of me…I called and canceled my service due [to] false pretense. I continue to receive calls and emails of harassment from this company after I have filed a cease and desist against them. I am not well health-wise and this is taking a toll on me even more. I have requested my contract from [LENDER NAME] and they have not sent me a copy. I was told that I would not have to pay them for a year which was a lie and that when I did my taxes I would get {$10000.00} reimbursement which was also a lie."" 41




""I believe that [LENDER NAME] and XXXX XXXX are responsible for claims made by the sales representative 's misrepresentation of the federal tax credit. I believe that the sales representative knew that the tax credit is usually NOT cash received as he made me believe. But as I have since learned the tax credit is used to pay down any tax liability that I may owe at the end of the year. Had that been made clear to me I never would have agreed to the loan. Again during the loan competition process, it was never mentioned or eluded to that I may have to pay 30 % out of pocket to pay down my loan to the expected sales price of {$45000.00}. I am willing to pay the loan. I'm just not willing to pay the loan inclusive of the {$19000.00} tax credit. I know now that this was a bad deal from the start and the federal tax credit was misrepresented to me by both the seller and the lender."" 42




""PREDATORY LENDING, PREDATORY SALES, AND ELDER ABUSE: 30% TAX CREDIT FORCED UPON ME BY BOTH THE SELLER AND THE LENDER WITHOUT MY FULL UNDERSTANDING…Why does the finance company get to further cement the idea that I will be able to use the tax credit to pay down my loan when they have no idea if I even qualify for the tax credit? And, if I did receive the tax credit money in my hand, why does the finance company get to dictate or strongly suggest how I spend the money? [SALESPERSON NAME] leads with the 30 % tax credit and [LENDER NAME] uses the initial low payment as bait to get me to agree to pay the 30 % within 18 months. Because, of course, anyone would rather have a low payment. But, If I dont or cant pay the 30 % then the payment switches to the higher amount. So, instead of starting me at the low payment with the expectation that I will have the money to pay down my loan. LET THE PRICE BE THE PRICE. AND LET MY PAYMENT BE MY PAYMENT. So that the payment doesnt have to balloon after 18 months. Its my right to choose when given a fair choice."" 43

CFPB analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey finds a relationship between age, having solar panels, and reliance on a form of payment other than cash (such as financing by contractor, home equity loans, and other) to make home improvements. Specifically, between 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of older homeowners with solar panels reported relying on these other methods, compared to 36 percent among homeowners aged 18 to 59.44

According to a company that tracks and analyzes direct marketing activity, between 2021 and 2023, consumers ages 18 and older received 8.4 million pieces of mail advertisement that included promotions for solar energy systems’ financing. About one-third of these pieces (34 percent or 2.8 million) were sent to adults ages 60 and older. A large portion (62 percent) of the mail advertisement for solar systems targeted at older adults was part of promotional packages that included ads for other services such as windows, roofing, kitchen remodeling, and other improvements.45

While there is limited data on the extent of solar adoption among limited English proficiency populations, some reports have flagged that in addition to other practices, some solar salespeople are conducting sales pitches targeting limited English proficiency consumers in their preferred language but are providing the solar purchase contract only in English.46

Conclusion

Homeowners have the potential to generate substantial savings by making improvements to their home that generate clean energy and increase energy efficiency. However, these investments require upfront costs that many families must finance.

The CFPB has been working to ensure that costly financing for clean energy does not wipe away expected energy savings or expose the family to serious financial risks. Last year, the CFPB put forth proposed rules regarding property assessed clean energy (PACE) loans, which increase the cost of monthly tax assessments as a way to finance clean energy improvements.

As solar energy installations continue to grow in popularity, the agency will be working closely with federal and state regulators and law enforcement to ensure that the financing of solar energy installations is fair, transparent, and competitive.

Endnotes

There are other solar energy technologies—such as concentrated solar power, which uses mirror or lenses to generate steam-powered electricity—but given their limited use in residential projects they will not be discussed. This Issue Spotlight also does not directly touch upon the growing market for solar energy storage (which allows consumers to store the excess energy produced during the day to use at night) via add-on battery systems.

It is important to note that, although it has experienced rapid growth, the residential market (rooftop and community solar) represent less than a quarter of all cumulative solar installations in the U.S., with installations from utilities alone comprising approximately two thirds. However, residential installations did overtake commercial installations in the late 2010s.

Per the International Energy Agency, one factor that has reduced solar prices worldwide is substantial oversupply relative to the number of installations (https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/011224-world-stuck-in-major-solar-panel-supply-glut-module-prices-plummet-iea ).
Despite this significant downward pricing trend, the median solar installation cost in the United States ($2.80, as of the end of 2023) is still four times as high as in Australia ($0.70, per https://news.energysage.com/why-is-solar-more-expensive-in-the-us/ ). According to the solar energy marketplace EnergySage, Australia has been able to achieve low installation costs in part by “simplifying the permitting requirements for solar installations and by hiring dedicated solar inspectors.” According to SEIA, approximately two-thirds of solar installation costs in the U.S. are “soft” costs, which includes “installation labor, customer acquisition, and permitting/inspection/interconnection.” (Wood Mackenzie US Solar Market Insight, Q4 2022).

Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is another option some consumers have to finance certain home improvements, including solar panel installation on their homes. The CFPB has proposed rules for PACE financing as mandated by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. See 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(3)(C). A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published on May 11, 2023, along with a report on the effect of PACE on consumers’ financial outcomes.

In the jurisdictions that offer net metering, its benefits are traditionally much greater in the warmer and brighter months and in sunnier climates. In some months, the amount of energy generated by the panels may be greater than the amount of energy that the house consumes, which can result in “negative” electricity bills (usually paid in the form of credits to be applied to future bills).

While not technically a necessary condition, government-mandated net metering—which enables solar farms to sell their energy to retail utilities at favorable rates and pass those savings on to community solar subscribers—substantially increases the logistical and financial viability of a potential community solar project. As of 2024, 24 states in addition to the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have passed legislation enabling some form of these net metering benefits, and those states account for approximately two thirds of the nation’s community solar volume. The remaining third of the community solar market comes in the other 26 states, where participation from the utilities is voluntary and approved on a case-by-case basis by state regulatory commissions.

Additionally, in July 2024, the Center for Responsible Lending published a report, entitled “The Shady Side of Solar System Financing,” that raised several concerns with solar-specific loans. See https://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/nodes/files/research-publication/crl-shady-side-solar-financing-jul2024.pdf . One of those concerns was hidden fees: “Hidden finance fees harm homeowners because they are unaware of how much they could save if they financed the solar panels through alternative means without a dealer fee.”

An additional concern from the report involves Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) liens. Lenders commonly file UCC liens on the solar panels themselves. As the report notes, a UCC lien is “technically not on the property, but it can muddy the title because some jurisdictions view the lien as applying to the whole property. If this occurs, the lien must either be released or made subordinate to the mortgage or refinance.”

By CFPB Web Team – DEC 19, 2013
SHARE & PRINT

Along with authorities in 49 states, and the District of Columbia, we’re filing an order  requiring the largest nonbank mortgage loan servicer in the country, Ocwen Financial Corporation, to pay for years of systemic misconduct in mortgage servicing. The misconduct included unfair shortcuts, unauthorized fees, deception, illegal foreclosures, and other illegal practices. Ocwen will be required to provide $2 billion in loan modification relief to its customers and $125 million in refunds to consumers whose homes were foreclosed.

Since 2009, Ocwen has been taking advantage of homeowners with shortcuts and unauthorized fees and deceiving consumers about loan modifications. We have mortgage rules that will take effect in January 2014  that establish strong protections for struggling homeowners facing foreclosure.

We have answers to some of your questions about this case:

Q: What is a mortgage servicer and how do I know if Ocwen services my loan?

A: The company that you make your monthly payment to is your mortgage servicer. Many of the loans administered by servicers are owned by third-party investors, so they may or may not be a lending institution and may or may not own your loan. A mortgage servicer administers mortgage loans, including collecting and recording payments from borrowers. A servicer also handles loan defaults and foreclosures, and may offer programs to avoid foreclosure to assist delinquent borrowers.

You can find out whether your mortgage is serviced by Ocwen by calling (800) 337-6695 or emailing your question to ConsumerRelief@Ocwen.com.

Q: How will I know whether this settlement affects me?

A: This settlement involves Ocwen and two companies recently purchased by Ocwen: Litton Loan Servicing LP and Homeward Residential Holdings LLC (previously known as American Home Servicing, Inc. or AMHSI). If your loan was serviced by Ocwen, Litton, or Homeward, you lost your home to foreclosure between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2012, and if you meet other criteria, the settlement administrator will mail you a notice letter and claim form.

For loan modification options, you may be contacted directly by Ocwen. You can also contact Ocwen for information about specific loan modification programs and find out if you will be impacted by this settlement. You can reach Ocwen by calling (800) 337-6695 or emailing ConsumerRelief@Ocwen.com.

Q: Will there be payments to foreclosure victims?

A: Yes. The settlement administrator will mail Notice Letters and Claim Forms to borrowers who lost their home due to foreclosure between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012, whose loans were serviced by Ocwen, Homeward, or Litton, and who meet other criteria. Borrowers who receive payments will not have to release any claims and will be free to seek additional relief in the courts.

Q: How do I know if I am eligible for payment as a foreclosure victim?

A: You are eligible if you meet the following requirements:

Your home was foreclosed between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012.
At the time of foreclosure, the loan was serviced by Ocwen, Homeward, or Litton.
You made at least three payments on the loan.
You lived or intended to live in the property as your principal place of residence at the time of the origination of the loan.
The property was a one-to-four unit residential property.
The unpaid principal balance of the first-lien did not exceed $729,750 for a one-unit property, $934,200 for a two-unit property, $1,129,250 for a three-unit property, or $1,403,400 for a four-unit property.
You make a valid claim.

Q: If I am eligible for foreclosure relief, how much will I get?

A: That depends. All consumers who successfully file eligible claims will receive an equal payment based on the total number of successful claims.

Q: What about those borrowers who continued making payments?

A: Borrowers who are current on their payments but are nonetheless struggling to make their payments and are “underwater” on their mortgages may qualify for loan modifications that will result in reductions in principal.

For loan modification options, borrowers may be contacted directly by Ocwen.

Borrowers can also contact Ocwen themselves to obtain more information about specific loan modification programs and inquire whether the borrower may be impacted by this settlement. You can reach Ocwen by calling (800) 337-6695 or emailing ConsumerRelief@Ocwen.com.

Q: What laws did Ocwen violate?

A: Ocwen is charged with engaging in unfair and deceptive acts or practices in violation of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Act and state laws. Ocwen’s unlawful conduct has resulted in injury to consumers who have had home loans serviced by Ocwen, Litton , and Homeward. The harm includes payment of improper fees and charges, unreasonable delays and expenses to obtain loss mitigation relief, and improper denial of loss mitigation relief.

We have some more answers to specific questions about the Ocwen settlement .

Banking in video games and virtual worlds
APR 04, 2024
Executive summary

As video games and virtual worlds have become more and more popular, gaming assets have become increasingly valuable. Gaming assets are stored on a player’s accounts and used as a medium of exchange for all sorts of transactions within these worlds, including the purchase of goods and services and person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers.

Banking and payment services that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets generally provide consumer protections, including recourse after unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds typically emphasize a “buyer beware” approach. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring markets—regardless of the infrastructure used—where financial products and services may be offered, including video games and virtual worlds.

Key findings
Gaming assets flow in and out of gaming marketplaces in a variety of ways and can have immense value. To leverage that value, financial products and services have begun entering gaming in the form of payment processing, money transmission, and even loans.
With the rise in value of gaming assets, there have also been increased reports of users losing access to gaming assets through hacking attempts, account theft, scams, and unauthorized transactions. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to traditional banking and payment systems.
Gaming publishers can collect a host of surveillance data about their users. This includes location data, social media data, and behavioral interactions, such as how a player responds to personalized incentives. There is risk that gamers may be harmed when their data is sold, bought, and traded between companies, including for purposes outside of game play.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, U.S. marketplaces have seen a shift from traditional brick-and-mortar commerce to online marketplaces. Consumers increasingly conduct commercial activity online, typically relying on the infrastructure developed by banks and payment systems using fiat currency. For instance, consumers today primarily use debit or credit cards or other similar methods when conducting online transactions. Virtual currencies are steadily becoming an important part of the online commerce ecosystem. One prominent example of this trend is transactions that occur in games and virtual worlds.

Billions of U.S. dollars (USD) are spent each year in gaming and virtual worlds, where consumers buy gaming assets1 using fiat currency and then use those assets to make purchases in-game. Some games also allow consumers to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency. These marketplaces and the infrastructure that supports them increasingly resemble traditional banking and payments systems. Yet operators of gaming and virtual worlds do not appear to provide the kinds of customer protections that apply to banking and payment systems.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is monitoring non-traditional markets where financial products and services may be offered, including the use of virtual currencies in games and virtual worlds. This report examines:

The evolution of the gaming industry and the revenue shift from one-time purchases of games to smaller payments made during game play.
The systems that enable fiat currency to flow into and out of games and virtual worlds and make it possible to assign and extract considerable value from gaming assets both inside and outside of the game.
How video games and virtual worlds act as electronic platforms that enable players to store and transfer valuable assets.
Recent activity by companies to leverage gaming assets and their value by providing services that increasingly resemble traditional financial products, like loans and proprietary payment systems.

The CFPB is also monitoring a number of concerning issues regarding gaming markets. These issues include, for instance, the recourse (or lack thereof) for players who incur financial losses due to theft, scams, or other criminal activity. Other issues include the proliferation of both fraud and money laundering facilitated by the two-way flow of money on these platforms, as well as the ability of gaming companies to collect an immense amount of sensitive consumer data, including data that is not only used to enhance game play but also to manipulate prices and monetize gaming in other ways. Ultimately, this activity raises questions about gaming companies’ compliance with applicable law, including federal consumer financial protection laws.2

The ability to leverage, store, and transfer valuable assets within gaming markets and the collection and use of player data to inform that market may create significant risks to consumers, especially young consumers. The CFPB expects that emerging trends in the gaming market, as detailed in this issue spotlight, will be of interest to policymakers and other government agencies with responsibilities related to the issues uncovered.

The gaming industry

The gaming industry has evolved rapidly, and gaming assets, such as in-game currency and virtual items, have become increasingly valuable alongside that evolution. Beginning in arcades, gaming originally relied on a one-time payment model, where players would pay a few cents for the opportunity to collect “power pellets” or purses. The industry soon shifted to home computers and consoles, where players would pay a fixed, up-front cost to play a game from beginning to end, collecting gold coins or “power-ups” along the way. Today, game revenue is no longer based solely on such one-time purchases. The highest revenue-generating games mostly profit through small, one-off payments known as microtransactions that are made throughout the lifetime of a game.3 The industry continues to trend in this direction, with many games changing to a free-to-play monetization model.4

Moreover, gaming is no longer constrained to just playing with people in the same room as you. Online gaming has made it possible for players to join virtual worlds with millions of other players. These types of games can include massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) games like World of Warcraft, Runescape, and Final Fantasy, which usually involve players working together to accomplish a specific goal and collect objects, experiences, or territories. There are also platforms like Second Life, Roblox, and Fortnite that offer immersive, community driven, free-form virtual worlds.5 Recent market trends, including the development of augmented, virtual, and mixed-reality headsets—also known as AR/VR/MR headsets—point towards shifts that continue to blur the boundaries between the offline world and immersive, virtual worlds.6

For most of these games, a key part of game play is having an asset, item, or currency and using that currency to buy virtual items and services within the game. For virtual worlds, items purchased are typically cosmetic in nature and used to individualize players’ avatars. Players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. Most of these games have in-game marketplaces where assets can be bought, sold, or traded. As a result, gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial payments.7

Market participants

Recent estimates value the global gaming industry at $249.55 billion in 2022.8 Global revenue for video games is expected to reach $321.1 billion by 2026.9

The gaming industry consists of many large, established companies such as Microsoft (including Activision Blizzard), Sony, Valve (Steam), Epic Games, Roblox, and Electronic Arts. Collectively, these companies earn billions in global revenues.10 The largest gaming companies typically own blockbuster games or popular virtual world platforms. For instance,

In 2023, Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard—creator of popular games such as World of Warcraft—for $75.4 billion.11 In January 2024, Microsoft announced it made $7.11 billion from gaming that quarter, exceeding earnings from flagship products like Windows.12
In December 2023, the immersive, virtual world platform Roblox averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally.13 That year, the company made approximately $2.8 billion in revenue.14

Some of the most successful gaming companies have increasingly sought to provide players with a “one-stop shop” experience that integrates playing, distributing, and storing games, as well as game assets, in one place. For example,

Valve owns Steam, a digital distribution service and storefront where players can play and buy games, as well as trade gaming assets for additional fees.15
Sony originally joined the gaming industry as a console manufacturer in partnership with Nintendo. However, in 1994, Sony developed the PlayStation, the first gaming console that used CDs instead of cartridges. Sony’s console continued to evolve over the years adding a digital media entertainment service and virtual marketplace, allowing players to purchase and store games.16 Recently, Sony changed its PlayStation store model to prevent digital download codes from other retailers, making it the sole digital game distributor for owners of its console.17

Games backed by large companies are so influential that some industry observers have suggested the odds of lower budget games breaking through in the market are shrinking.18 At the same time, large technology companies, with their vast resources, have been increasing their footprint in this space. For example:

In 2014, Amazon acquired the market’s leading video game livestreaming service Twitch.19
The U.S. AR/VR/MR market size was valued at $4.39 billion in 202020 and large technology companies have bet big on creating games and headsets to fit this technology.
Meta released its Meta Quest headset and VR game, Horizon Worlds, in 2018 and then subsequently invested $15.9 billion in the technology.21
Meanwhile, Apple launched its Vision Pro headset, which advertises the ability to “transport users to stunning game play environments and exciting new places” in 2024.22 Apple’s headset also integrates Apple’s phone payment system with features like sending and requesting money through Apple Pay,23 and facilitating online shopping.24
Gamers in the U.S.

American consumers spent $56.6 billion on gaming in 2022, including hardware and content, like game purchases and microtransactions. According to research, the typical gamer skews slightly male,25 even though the number of female gamers has been steadily increasing recently.26 Research has shown that players typically average 12.8 hours a week gaming across multiple platforms and most often play video games on their phones, gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops.27

For many young people today, gaming may be their introduction to financial activity. For example, gaming provides young people the opportunity to learn about earning currency, managing assets, and making purchases.28 Gaming companies may view young players as an opportunity to create lifelong consumers early. An estimated 76 percent of children in the United States play video games.29 The most popular virtual platform among young people in the U.S. is Roblox,30 which, as previously mentioned, averaged 71.5 million active daily users globally in December 202331 and roughly 58 percent of those users were under the age of 16.32 Its popularity is largely due to the ease in which players “can invite friends to join…different virtual worlds or games” on the platform.""33 Research has shown that today’s young people primarily turn to video games and virtual worlds to socialize with friends, rather than the draw of playing a game.34 Harnessing the appeal of socialization, technology and gaming companies have expressed their intention to market VR headsets—and as a result community driven, free-form virtual worlds—to children as young as 10 years old.35

Young people may be especially vulnerable to tactics used by gaming companies to induce spending and monetize gaming, as their financial habits are still forming.36 In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised concerns about loot boxes,37 including the effectiveness of disclosures prior to purchase, the design of loot boxes promoting compulsive spending, and potential risks to young players. The FTC also noted that the gaming industry has taken steps to self-regulate loot boxes.38 Nonetheless, in 2022, a study found that American youths’ consumption of loot boxes is on the rise39 and additional research suggests that loot box usage by children or teens can potentially lead to problems with gambling later in life.40 Internationally, regulatory efforts have focused on disclosing the odds of loot box rewards and including 'gambling-like mechanisms' in age-rating decisions.41 Within the U.S., efforts have been mostly focused on industry-wide self-regulation rather than specific policy interventions.42

Monetizing player data

While playing games, companies collect a great deal of data and information on the player. The collection of this data is often marketed as beneficial to the player and their game play, as it can be used to provide a unique and personalized experience.43 However, this data can be used to monetize game play in a manner that may take advantage of players’ proclivities to entice more spending.44 This data is also often sold, bought, and traded between companies.45

Types of data collected

As players move through a game, game publishers track their behavior. This behavior can include financial data like purchasing history, spending thresholds, and how a player responds to personalized incentives like dynamic price updates. It also includes non-financial data, like how players interact with characters and the amount of time spent on tasks.46

The technology used to operate mobile games or render virtual or mixed-reality environments collects an immense amount of sensitive player data. Gaming consoles, mobile phone gaming applications, and gaming platforms often track lifestyle and behavioral measurements like location data and interactions with games and devices,47 as well as details obtained through integrations with social media platforms.48 Viewed as a whole, this data can be used to generate an accurate portrait of a player’s offline identity, including their daily routines, home address, places of employment or worship, and who they connect with while playing.49

Similarly, AR/VR/MR headsets track a player’s movements and physical behavior to render a VR scene used to interact with virtual environments. This data includes biometric data such as posture, eye gaze, gestures, facial expressions, voice, heart rate, and interpersonal distance. Eye movement, pupil response, and gait analysis are considered especially sensitive.50 Researchers have associated eye-movement tracking with ADHD symptoms51 and Alzheimer’s,52 and this data collection poses medical privacy risks for that reason. The headsets generally also use audio, visual, and inertial sensors to detect the position and movement of a user or device relative to its surroundings. These sensors collect information about the user’s physical location, including the size of the room they are in and data on passive bystanders that happen to be within range.53

How gaming companies make money on player data
Microtransactions and discriminatory pricing

Optimizing game play based on player data is commonly referred to by industry experts as “dynamic odds.”54 Gaming companies have been using behavioral, biometric, and personal data to manipulate prices and the availability of goods or services on a highly individualized level.55

For example, if player data shows that a player is unlikely to spend money on microtransactions, their odds of earning—rather than buying—rare assets will increase. This practice helps advertise rare assets to players that do spend money. Where data shows that a player is willing to participate in microtransactions or pay more money to keep playing the game, the game will increase their prices and decrease their chances of earning rare assets.56

While some gaming terms of service state that prices of in-game items may be determined by factors that are not disclosed to the player—such as an algorithm that considers the player's available funds and cost sensitivity—the availability, value, and quality of goods, including those in the user's account, may change at any time.57

“Dynamic odds” impact the perceived value of gaming assets when their availability, price, and/or scarcity within the game is individualized and therefore the real value is obscured from the player. This use of data gives a misleading impression to the player about the fairness or neutrality of these opportunities.

Advertising

In addition to microtransactions, players often pay with their time and attention. The gaming industry uses player data and algorithms marketed as artificial intelligence or “AI” to target ads to specific audiences, making them more effective for advertisers and profitable for game publishers.58 For example, games can combine individual player location data, as well as data like birth date, age group, and gender with statistical location-based demographic data to provide advertisers with an array of audience targeting options including age, gender, family, and economic status.59 Game publishers can also use player behavior to make targeted ads more effective. For example, games can present non-skippable ads at certain intervals within the game when a player is highly motivated to continue playing. Sometimes, the player can pay to get rid of these ads. Other times, the player will have to watch the ad to keep playing or get a reward like in-game currency.60

Ultimately, this vast accumulation of data from consumers raises questions as to whether proper privacy regulations are being adhered to and whether consumers are fully aware of how their data is being used by gaming companies and across the industry. Without the right privacy protections, the data collected from gaming and AR/VR/MR headsets may be used to inform predictive models, including those marketed as artificial intelligence, and to adjust prices and game play or drive revenue growth.61

Examining the value of gaming assets

Gaming companies are using gaming assets and proprietary marketplaces to replicate everyday activities online, including financial activities. In-game currencies can act as mediums of exchange that players can use for all sorts of in-game transactions, such as person-to-person (“P2P”) transfers or buying and selling in-game goods and services. These assets may be “treasure keys,” or “gold pieces,” instead of USD, but their use is functionally the same. And like the offline world, game economies experience supply, demand, and fluctuating prices.

Many gaming companies view their assets as virtual, licensed content or a preloaded currency that can only be used in their proprietary virtual world. Many gaming companies also claim that their gaming assets have no monetary value, are irredeemable for fiat currency62 and that their environments function as closed markets. However, these markets can actually be quite porous and gaming assets can have considerable value, including outside of the game itself.

This is largely due to the two-way flow of money that makes it possible to assign and extract monetary value from gaming assets. Several games provide on-ramps of fiat currency into their systems by allowing gaming assets to be purchased with USD. And, although they’re not the majority, some prominent games allow players to extract fiat currency (“cash-out”) directly from their platform63 or enable third-party systems that facilitate a cash-out process.64 Most games do not currently enable a cash-out process themselves, but third-party systems have emerged to facilitate the conversion of some gaming assets to fiat currency through various means.65 The estimated value of these assets is even tracked on public websites that show the current exchange rate of various gaming currencies to USD.66

In-game and virtual currencies

In some of the most popular video games today, players generally earn or buy in-game currency, essentially converting fiat currency to in-game currency. In-game currency is then used to buy goods and services as a part of game play, including virtual items.67 Game publishers determine the conversion rate of fiat currency to in-game currencies and the prices of virtual items, as well as the supply.68 Figure 1 below shows the various cash-in and cash-out relationships of gaming and virtual world markets.

Figure 1: The possible flow of fiat currency in individual gaming markets69

Second Life, a large and popular online virtual world70 owned by Linden Lab that was released in 2003, is an example of a game with both on and off-ramps to convert fiat currency. In Second Life, “Residents” use the Linden Dollar (L$), which can be purchased both in-world and from Second Life’s official Linden Exchange (LindeX) using fiat currency. Linden dollars act as money, as the player can use it to buy and sell virtual items, tip, or pay other Residents,71 and buy original services.72 All Second Life accounts have both a Linden Dollar balance and a USD balance, and players can convert Linden Dollars back to USD by selling Linden Dollars on the Linden Exchange. The USD account balance can be withdrawn or used to pay for Second Life services like subscriptions or fees. The USD account balance is managed by Tilia, a licensed money transmitter and subsidiary of Linden Lab. The USD account balance can be withdrawn using PayPal or Skrill. During withdrawal, a 5-percent fee is taken from the transaction total and the first withdrawal typically takes about 30 days.73 Between 2011 and 2013, third-party websites allowed trading between Linden dollars and Bitcoin.74 In 2021, Second Life reported the average number of daily users to be 200,000 users across 200 countries and a GDP equivalent of over $600 million,75 more than some small countries.76

On the other hand, League of Legends is an example of a game that does not allow players to cash-out within the game, but third-party systems exist that enable the exchange of its in-game currency for fiat currency. The game has two main currencies: Blue Essence (BE), which has no cash-in or cash-out process, and Riot Points (RP), which is exclusively obtained for purchase via fiat currency. Riot Points are used in the in-game market to purchase various virtual items that work across all games made by Riot Games.77 League of Legends does not allow Riot Points to be cashed-out within the game, but third-party systems enable the exchange of Riot Points for fiat currency.78

Virtual items, such as skins or cosmetic items

Virtual items, such as “skins”,79 are usually ornamental or cosmetic goods that have no impact on game play but have become a token of status and in some instances are considered immensely valuable by players.80 In general, virtual items are typically acquired through one of the following ways:

Earned as a reward in game play.
Bought with USD or in-game currency as a microtransaction.
Bought, sold, or traded through in-game, secondary, or third-party markets for fiat currency, other virtual items, or in-game currency.
Won in a “random chance” loot box.

Importantly, virtual items can sometimes be traded between players as an acceptable form of payment.81 For example, in the virtual world of Habbo Hotel, items are exchanged between players through the in-game market. Plastic chairs were originally designed to furnish virtual apartments. Over time, these chairs gradually became the currency of the game. Prices on the market would be denominated in plastic chairs, and the exchange of plastic chairs would allow players to buy goods or services within the game.82

Notably, the value of these skins or cosmetic items can be converted into fiat currency and certain skins reach surprisingly high value in virtual markets that allow P2P trading. The Steam Community Market is a platform-supported secondary market where players go to buy, trade, and sell items outside of individual games. Within the individual games, skins only have cosmetic use value, but on the Steam Community Market, these assets have “exchange value,”83 meaning skins can be bought, sold, or traded among players for Steam Wallet funds or other skins.84 This value can be so great that, in Steam’s terms and conditions, they even acknowledge that proceeds from these sales or trades may be considered as taxable income to players and thereby subject to applicable laws.85

Although, the Steam Community Market does not directly facilitate a cash-out process to withdraw Steam wallet funds for fiat currency,86 there is an entire ecosystem of third-party markets that are enabled by Steam’s application programming interface (API).87 These sites facilitate player-to-player trading and converting skins to crypto-assets or fiat currency, leading to even higher exchange values for some individual skins on these third-party markets, as well as the Steam Community Market.88 For example, the largest sale of a Counter-Strike skin occurred in 2023 on a third-party website for over $500,000.89

Third-party websites also facilitate a growing skin gambling industry that supports wagering skins, similar to casino chips, in virtual games such as blackjack, roulette, or craps.90 For example, a player’s account balance can be made up of skins, conventional currency, and other forms of virtual currency that are then converted to that site’s form of credit.91 Skins are then won or lost depending on the outcomes of the games.92 Third-party websites also facilitate skin betting on events like competitive gaming contests, also known as esports,93 and games between professional sports teams.94 Winnings can be converted to fiat currency or other forms of virtual currency and withdrawn for a fee directly to the player’s digital wallet.95

Third-party systems convert gaming assets to USD

Many third-party systems facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of in-game currency, virtual items, and even entire player accounts. However, third-party systems do not need to be enabled by a company’s API to convert gaming assets back to conventional currency and at the time of this report, many games make it impossible to convert gaming assets back to fiat currency without using a third-party market or website.96 For example, third-party sites support the selling of game currencies for USD from games where an API doesn’t exist like RuneScape, World of Warcraft, and others.97

To convert gaming assets these sites first connect interested buyers with sellers so they can then exchange assets within the game. The buyer then pays the seller through the third-party website and the seller can withdraw that payment in their preferred fiat currency directly to a bank account or digital wallet for a fee. Because these sites facilitate the transaction, players are able to exchange gaming assets for fiat currency.98

Figure 2: Markets available outside individual games
Crypto-asset related virtual worlds

Though their usage remains sparse, a number of virtual worlds and games exist that utilize crypto-assets—such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—as virtual items, or crypto-assets as game currency.99 The relationship between these virtual worlds and their official crypto-assets is similar to video games and their in-game currencies. Players purchase the virtual world’s native asset and use it to buy goods and services within that virtual world’s economy.

While these crypto-asset virtual worlds are significantly less popular than virtual gaming worlds like Roblox, Second Life, or Fortnite,100 they are important to note because of the prevalence of third-party crypto-asset trading platforms, users can convert a virtual world’s native crypto-asset to fiat currency, making them even more porous than typical gaming markets. Notably, some of the largest virtual gaming world publishers have expressed growing interest in positioning their virtual items as crypto-assets that have the ability to be traded outside of the game’s economy.101

Examples of these crypto-asset related virtual worlds include Decentraland, which uses a crypto-asset called MANA, and The Sandbox, which uses a crypto-asset called SAND.102 Both of these in-game crypto-assets can be used for transactions within their respective virtual worlds and can also be traded on other crypto-asset platforms for USD.103

In the game Axie Infinity, players interact virtually through digital pets called “Axies,” each of which is a non-fungible token (NFT) stored on the Ronin network. Users earn the crypto-asset Smooth Love Potion (SLP) by playing the game. Players can also “breed” new Axies by spending SLP and another crypto-asset token, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). Users can trade SLP and AXS for fiat currency or other crypto-assets on third party crypto-asset trading platforms.104 At the height of its success, Axie Infinity had over 2.7 million daily active users105 but as the number of users grew, the NFTs required to play became very expensive, leading to hierarchies of users: investors, managers, and workers.106 While the crypto-asset industry and its investors lauded the game as a viable way to earn income, reports documented the ways the gaming system exploited workers.107 The ecosystem largely fell apart in 2022 following a breach of the game by a state-sponsored hacking group.108

Conversion and purchase issues with in-game currency

Industry experts have expressed concern about the tactics game makers use to obscure the real costs of gaming assets from players.109 Games frequently use currency bundles110 to hide the true value of what players may purchase and to make larger quantities seem like the “better deal.” These pre-set bundles are often in large quantities (e.g., 100, 1,000, or 10,000 units) with confusing exchange rates (e.g. 2/3, 3/5, 5/7), rather than the exact amount needed for a particular in-game purchase or activity.

In some cases, games may also have more than one currency with different exchange rates for each currency, making the mental conversions between fiat currency and the game currency difficult. This often leads to large amounts of unused currency without any way to get it out of the game. Some players believe this is done by game makers to maximize profits as players are unable to track the exact amount of money spent but feel obligated to keep playing to avoid sunk costs.111

Converting game assets back to fiat currency within a game can lead to increased costs for players, for example, by using differing ratios for deposits and withdrawals or burdensome thresholds for withdrawal. For instance, the popular game Roblox allows players to create games and virtual worlds within Roblox’s gaming universe, as well as play games created by other users. As users move from game-to-game within Roblox, they can buy virtual items in exchange for Robux, the platform’s in-game currency. When a virtual item is bought within a game developed by a specific player, that player earns Robux. Roblox’s terms and conditions only allows players that are active creators112 to cash-out their earned Robux for fiat currency.113 Notably, while Roblox has separate ""User Terms"" and ""Creator Terms,"" everyone who joins Roblox’s must agree to both terms and conditions, essentially making all players also creators.114 To convert earned Robux115 to USD, an active creator must earn a minimum of 30,000 Robux. Additionally, Roblox’s conversion rate to USD is not intuitive. Buying 100,000 Robux through Roblox’s store costs $1,000, but withdrawing 100,000 of earned Robux only gets a player $350.116 Even with these constraints, Roblox players that are creators withdrew $740.8 million in 2023.117

Gaming platforms facilitate the P2P transfer of gaming assets

As previously mentioned, gaming assets are frequently exchanged or transferred among players through various means. These means can include gifting virtual items to other players, which is supported by games like Fortnite, Rocket League, and Minecraft.118 As well as, platform-supported secondary markets like the Steam Community Marketplace and in-game markets like RuneScape’s expansive transfer market, where individuals can trade valuable virtual items in their inventory and currency with other players.119 Gaming platforms and virtual worlds thus appear to function like payment systems by facilitating the storage and exchange of valuable assets.

Players have also found ways to recreate traditional P2P transfer activities within gaming markets that do not allow it. While Roblox expressly disallows person-to-person transfers of Robux,120 users facilitate the transfer process themselves by purchasing quickly developed items from an individual enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program, who may also be a player. The individual who receives Robux from the purchase of their item will receive 70 percent of the earned Robux. This effectively transfers Robux from one person (the buyer) to another (the seller).121 This also extends to collectives known as “Roblox Groups,” which include individuals that are enrolled in the Developer Exchange Program and who want to split Robux revenue. These earnings can then be transferred to USD through a one-time or recurring payment.122

The impact of gaming assets having monetary value

Video games and virtual worlds appear to be functioning more and more like banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. As gaming assets store greater amounts of value and their use becomes increasingly similar to that of money, the CFPB is monitoring how gaming assets are used and the associated risks, including those impacting children and the emergence of products or services that resemble traditional consumer financial products or services.

Accounts may be vulnerable to losses

When in-game currency or virtual items are earned during game play or procured via microtransactions, they are stored on a player’s account for future use. This use can include transactions within the game,123 trading virtual items with other players,124 buying products on platform-supported secondary markets,125 converting gaming assets to fiat currency,126 withdrawals as fiat currency,127 or using third-parties to convert and withdraw as fiat currency.128 As a result, a player’s account is considered highly valuable. In fact, several third-party systems facilitate the buying and selling of entire player accounts themselves, not just individual gaming assets.129

The practice of harvesting in-game currency for sale on a player account, also known as gold farming and the amount of potential earnings has drawn seasoned players to this practice as a source of income. However, as detailed below, gaming accounts often lack the security and protections of traditional bank accounts. Some of the most common scams include defrauding a player of the assets stored on their account, as well as hacking into their account and transferring in-game currency to another account.

Account vulnerabilities

The monetary value of player accounts combined with the ability to cash-out gaming assets has led to an influx of phishing attempts and reports of account theft. Attackers often use compromised user credentials to break into player accounts and access game currency or virtual items. They then use third-party systems to transfer gaming assets to another account or sell the assets for fiat currency.130 A recent study from 10,000 gamers globally showed that 63 percent of respondents feel their accounts aren't safe enough from attacks—with one in three reporting that their accounts had been hacked in the last two years.131 Industry experts consider young gamers especially at risk of phishing attempts due to their likely presence on social media and lack of awareness about social engineering tactics.132 Consumers are also potentially threatened by an emerging market of account recovery scammers that promote their ability to obtain lost gaming assets for victims of theft.133

Recourse when assets are lost

In complaints to the FTC and CFPB, several players reported hacking attempts, account theft, scams, unauthorized transactions, and losing access to game currencies and virtual items, but they received limited recourse from gaming companies. Gaming companies often take a “buyer beware” approach, putting the burden on individual players to avoid these scams and phishing attempts. They may lock or ban players’ accounts suspected of scamming and phishing but do little to provide remedy to the victim. For example, stolen items on Steam are not returned due in part to market incentives. Steam states that its virtual items' value is “at least partially determined by that item's scarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy…the value of every other instance of that item would be reduced.”134

Consumers have complained that some gaming companies will terminate the accounts of players for pursuing recourse from their financial institution for unauthorized game purchases. In their terms and conditions, Roblox requests users to “contact Roblox Support before disputing any charges directly with your payment processor.”135 The CFPB and FTC have received complaints from players who contacted their financial institutions regarding unauthorized Roblox game purchases. These complaints note that while they received refunds through their financial institutions, Roblox then terminated or locked their account.

When a player loses access to their account because they are accused of violating a game’s terms of service or a game is terminated altogether, the game publishers state that they have no obligation to compensate the players for their lost assets or return the money players have invested.136

Fraud in gaming markets

The ability to transfer and otherwise convert gaming assets to fiat currency or crypto-assets has led to a proliferation of money laundering137 and fraud138 on gaming platforms.

Researchers and academics have found that gaming markets can facilitate illegal money laundering.139 For example, a person can open different player accounts on several online gaming platforms, use those accounts to buy gaming assets with illegally obtained funds. They can then send the assets to other accounts within the game and then convert them to fiat currency using third-party markets. These practices enable ill-gotten funds to become less traceable with each step.140

Further, the conditions of gaming markets embolden activities such as fraudulent transactions and scams. In 2023, one firm estimated that it lost $110 million due to fraudulent transactions.141 The CFPB has received complaints regarding various trade scams on these third-party websites. In one complaint, a consumer reports that they purchased a gaming account from a prominent third-party website and confirmed receipt of the account. However, once receipt was confirmed, the account was hacked and recovered by the original owner. Per the third-party website’s terms and conditions, once receipt was confirmed, there was no available recourse for the buyer.142

Issues with third-party systems

The terms and conditions of these third-party websites can be misleading or otherwise obscure the truth about the risks involved in their services. For example, some third-party websites entice users with gaming assets, like discounted bundles of game currency or rare virtual items, in exchange for downloading applications, watching advertiser content, or submitting personal details.143 These tactics potentially expose players to risks like credit card fraud, malware, and identity theft. 144

Several of these third-party websites collect a large amount of personally identifiable information including email addresses, gaming usernames, and log data, such as IP addresses and browser information. They may also need banking information to process payments through services like Stripe and PayPal.145 Yet, these marketplaces have had a number of data breaches and hacks.146 These incidents have also occurred at large gaming companies, pointing to an industry-wide security issue.147 As these markets evolve, including functioning more and more like banking and payment systems, it is imperative that companies take appropriate data security steps.148

Gaming specific financial products

Leveraging the value of gaming assets and the amount of commerce occurring on gaming platforms, some companies have begun exploring gaming-specific services that resemble traditional financial products. For example, J.P. Morgan recently expressed interest in an “embedded payment ecosystem” for gaming, meaning a “wallet, that can serve as a central hub for anything related to a player: gaming credentials, in-game currency balances and transactions and spending history.”149 J.P. Morgan Payments has also provided strategic investment to Tilia, a payment processer and subsidiary of Linden Lab.150 Tilia was created to provide financial services to virtual worlds in the form of in-game transactions, payouts to creators, and conversions of in-game currencies to fiat currency, including USD. “Tilia is currently partnered with several virtual worlds, online games, and NFT marketplaces, including Second Life, Upland and Avatus.”151

Similar products have also emerged by technology companies. ZELF launched in the US in June 2022 as a banking service for virtual worlds with the intention of easing the transfer of money between the online world and the offline world, as well as trading gaming assets between players.152 This was done through an instant and virtual Visa credit card secured by a deposit account, known as a ZELF Account, that could be opened within 30 seconds using only the applicant’s name, email, and phone number.153 Once issued, users could deposit crypto-assets, NFTs, and gaming assets to then be converted into fiat currency.154 Additionally, ZELF’s marketing suggests that its intended target audience was Gen Z and young people.155 According to reporting, the ZELF Account aimed to provide young people the ability to facilitate borrowing against gaming assets by holding game currency in escrow and providing players with payday loans.156 The ZELF Account157 was shut down within two days of publicly launching.158

In 2023, MetaLend announced a program that would allow “Axie Infinity players to take out loans against their in-game crypto-based assets.”159 Further, in 2022, an international technology company offered a two-year loan for approximately $30,000 to a Decentraland gamer. The loan was used to purchase digital land in the crypto-based virtual world and many reports at the time referred to the loan as the first mortgage of the metaverse. In the loan, the technology company owned the land and the borrower had to pay monthly payments to use the land. Once paid, the land would transfer to the borrower.160

The role of banks and consumer finance products within gaming is evolving, but there appears to be a trend towards introducing services that are similar to traditional consumer financial products that rely on the value of gaming assets and the digital transactions that are happening on gaming platforms.

Conclusion

For several years, the most popular video games have included immersive virtual worlds that offer the storage and exchange of valuable assets. Gaming companies have created digital marketplaces that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of these assets with limited consumer protections, which has led to potentially harmful practices for players including financial losses due to theft and scams.

Consumer protection laws apply to banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. The CFPB is monitoring non-traditional markets where consumer financial products and services may be offered, including where such products and services are provided by or in connection with proprietary gaming platforms.

Additionally, the vast accumulation of data collected from consumers by gaming companies raises questions as to whether privacy rules are being adhered to and whether consumers, especially young ones and their parents, are fully aware of how their data is being collected and used across the industry. The CFPB will continue to work with other agencies to monitor companies that assemble and sell sensitive consumer data, such as a consumer's payment history, especially when this data is harvested and monetized without the user’s awareness.

The public can submit complaints about consumer financial products and services on consumerfinance.gov/complaint or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Only complaints sent to companies for a response are published in the Consumer Complaint Database. Many complaints about gaming assets or accounts are not, but complaints that are not sent to the company for response are often referred to other regulatory agencies for handling under applicable law. The CFPB will continue to monitor evolving gaming markets and the costs and risks incurred by consumers.

Consumers who suspect a scam can contact their local police or state attorney general. Visit the National Association of Attorneys General  website for the contact information of each state attorney general.

Employees that believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.

A loot box is a seemingly randomized package of game assets where the player only knows the contents after paying and opening the package. Prior to opening a loot box, the contents are often marketed as containing rare and valuable items missing from a player’s collection, or game currency. These assets can then be sold for fiat currency on third-party websites.

“But why should we worry about using eye-tracking? Before going deep into the privacy concerns, let’s first see how does the eye-tracking data look like. Let’s look at the figure, where I plot one user’s eye gaze data as a heat map when they are browsing on an online store. We can see the two major clusters in the dense orange that represent users’ attention. The eye gaze data can be [bucketed] into two categories, fixation, and saccade. Fixations are eye gaze located close to each other, and it’s associated with users’ visual attention. Saccades are eye gaze traveling fast from one fixation to another. Users’ fixation … is associated with the regional interest in a visual scene. [Headsets] can analyze the spatial distribution of such eye gaze absolute positions to note about their attention, even subconsciously. Also, they can associate the aggregate statistic of eye gaze distribution with a lot of traits…These traits include psychological traits and physiological traits, such as implicit interest, cultural backgrounds, personality traits, health status, like Alzheimer’s or vision condition, and biometric identities and so on.” See FTC, supra note 50, at 58-59.

Chairman Murray, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the potential impact of student debt on the lives of American consumers and the broader economy.

My name is Rohit Chopra, and I serve as an Assistant Director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), where I lead an office that focuses on issues facing students and young Americans. In 2011, I was also designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as the Student Loan Ombudsman within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new role established by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Over the last decade, policymakers have focused heavily on trying to make college more affordable for students in years to come, which is an important goal. But the financial crisis, which destroyed trillions of dollars in home equity and savings for many families preparing to send a child to college, contributed to substantial increases in the amount of student debt owed by Americans who have since graduated from college. Therefore, it is important to focus on – and act to address – the impact of the $1.2 trillion in student debt already owed by more than 40 million Americans.

Growing Consensus

Two years ago, analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau uncovered that there was more than $1 trillion in outstanding student debt, and we raised the possibility that excessive student debt burdens may pose a problem for all of us. 1 Since that time, there has been growing consensus that today’s $1.2 trillion can have repercussions that threaten the economic security of young Americans and broader economic growth.

Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew remarked that student debt is “hampering our economy” across multiple sectors of society. 2 The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s monetary policy rate-setting board, identified student debt as a risk to aggregate household spending in coming years. 3The Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprised of financial regulators and monitors from across the U.S. government, noted last month that “high student-debt burdens may dampen consumption and could impact household demand for housing purchases.” 4

Senior executives in the banking industry have also cautioned that the condition of the student loan market “is now having a significantly negative impact on students, the economy, and taxpayers.” 5 America’s largest automaker has cited the overhang of student debt as a key factor explaining the relatively low levels of car purchases by young people. 6

Student Debt Domino Effect

Last year, the Bureau issued a public notice and held a hearing to gather input on the student debt domino effect, as well as potential policy options to mitigate the damage. We received more than 28,000 responses from experts and individuals impacted by student debt. 7 The responses from industry and consumers identified several potential areas of concern.

Homeownership and Household Formation

Respondents cited research that showed that three-quarters of the overall shortfall in household formation can be attributed to reductions among younger adults ages 18 to 34, the age group disproportionately impacted by student debt. 8 In 2011, two million more Americans in this age group lived with their parents, compared to 2007. 9

Professionals on the front line of the housing industry – from real estate agents to builders to mortgage bankers – have all described the challenges posed by student debt to homeownership. 10 There appears to be a number of specific effects, including: down payment accumulation, mortgage qualification, and move-up purchases.

According to a recent survey by the National Association of Realtors, 49 percent of Americans cited student loan debt as a “huge obstacle” to homeownership. Realtors have noted that first-time homebuyers typically rely heavily on savings to fund down payments. When young workers are putting large portions of their income toward student loan payments, this can extend the time it takes to accumulate that first down payment.

One borrower, Heather, told us she owes $115,000 in student loans from earning her degrees, half of which are private student loans. She loves her job as a nurse, but she also wrote, “I would also love to buy a new car and buy a home which I won’t be able to do for a very long time.” 11

The chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association noted that student debt will “have an extraordinary dampening effect on young peoples’ ability to borrow for a home, and that’s going to impact the housing market and the economy at large.” The National Association of Home Builders wrote to the Bureau about the relatively low share of first-time homebuyers in the market compared to historical levels and that student debt can “impair the ability of recent college graduates to qualify for a loan.” 12

Another borrower, Michelle, told us that she would be able to pay less per month if she bought a home rather than rented. But she was told her debt relative to her income meant that she could not qualify for a mortgage. 13

With lower levels of first-time buyers in the market, this also poses problems for existing homeowners. William Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said recently that student debt’s impact on first-time homeownership “makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.” 14

And the impact isn’t limited to those who want to buy a home. One realtor told us how she routinely checks credit reports for prospective renters. With student loans soaking up so much of their incomes, many applications end up being denied. With so many young Americans living with parents or roommates rather than forming their own households, this might have a material impact on purchases of other goods, like furniture and appliances.

Small Business and Entrepreneurship

Small business plays a critical role in creating opportunity and wealth in our economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, small businesses, defined as an independent entity having fewer than 500 employees, created two-thirds of net new jobs from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2012. But student debt may be stymying the efforts of entrepreneurs to sustain and grow their businesses.

One aspiring entrepreneur, Julie, wrote, “I am in the process of starting a business, but am unsure as to whether I can afford to because I have so much student loan debt.” 15

In submissions to the Bureau by coalitions of small businesses and startups, groups cited a number of potential negative impacts of student debt on entrepreneurship, such as access to credit and willingness to take financial risks. There has been an increasing amount of evidence to support these hypotheses.

Preliminary research on student debt and small business formation finds a “significant and economically meaningful negative correlation between changes in student loan debt and net business formation” for small businesses employing 1-4 employees. 16 Unlike larger firms with more seamless access to capital markets, small businesses often rely heavily on the owner’s personal access to credit used primarily for business purposes.

Longitudinal surveys of small businesses illustrate the outsized role that personal credit cards and personal bank loans play in financing the enterprise’s growth and survival. In early years, surviving small businesses rapidly increase their employment, while also heavily utilizing these forms of financing. One of the top reasons for denial of credit to small businesses is attributed to the owner’s personal credit profile. 17

In roundtable discussions with entrepreneurs, founders describe that their student debt forces them to take cash out of the business to make their payments, making it tougher to “bootstrap.” Those early revenues could otherwise be reinvested to hire employees or to expand their product offerings. Others have told the Bureau that prospective investors are concerned when founders have heavy student debt burdens, since the entrepreneur may be unable to maintain an extended period of negative cash flow or may be tempted to leave for a higher salary at a larger firm.

Retirement Security and Asset Accumulation

The impact of heavy student debt burdens may also have a longer-term effect on the ability of households to save and accumulate wealth for retirement. One borrower, Kristi, was quite straightforward when telling us about saving for retirement, “Don’t make me laugh! We can’t save for retirement because we need all of our money for these loans.” 18

Tabulations of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances reveals a large lag in net worth for younger households with student debt. Households headed by a younger college-educated adult had a net worth of just $8,700 – approximately 85% less than equivalent households without student debt, despite nearly identical household income between debtors and non-debtors. The difference is even more dramatic for student debtors who did not complete a bachelor’s degree. 19

Student debt can also have more long-term impacts on an individual’s financial security. Due to the shift away from defined benefit plans and toward 401(k)s, IRAs and other defined contribution plans, ensuring a secure retirement will be largely self-directed for most young workers. Young workers who are able to make early, sizable contributions to these plans can generate significant retirement assets over the course of their careers. But student debt may be impeding workers from making sizable contributions – or even contributing at all.

Recent analysis by the largest provider of employer-based defined contribution plans indicates that 43 percent of young workers participate in their employers’ plans, compared to approximately 70 percent of workers ages 35 to 64. For the greater than two-thirds of employers that do not feature automatic enrollment, participation in these plans by young workers drops to just 23 percent. 20

And according to two industry analyses, 43 percent of young workers do not save enough to receive a full employer match 22 and are more likely to cash out their plans when changing jobs. 22

If student debt acts as a headwind to young worker participation in retirement plans, the opportunity for wealth accumulation diminishes significantly. One recent estimate considered the impact of an average level of student loan debt for a college-educated household compared to a similarly situated debt-free household. The analysis found that student debt could crowd out more than $200,000 in net assets over a borrower’s working life, including a loss of nearly $135,000 in net retirement savings. 23

The impact on retirement security is not limited to younger workers – many older households are forced to reevaluate their retirement plans in light of debt used to finance the education of a child or grandchild. AARP wrote to the Bureau about the impact of student debt on families headed by households over the age of 50, noting that “increasing debt threatens their ability to save for retirement or accumulate other assets, and may end up requiring them to delay retirement.” 24

Health Care, Education and Rural America

The impact of student debt might also skew labor market outcomes. Notably, heavy debt burdens exacerbate the challenges that many communities face when seeking to attract and retain health care professionals and teachers. These problems may be felt even more acutely in rural America.

The American Medical Association noted that high debt burdens can impact the career choices of new doctors, leading some to abandon caring for the elderly or children for more lucrative specialties. 25 New research validates these concerns — the share of new medical school graduates pursuing primary care specialties has declined steadily since 2009 and student debt has been found to have been a statistically significant deterrent on the selection of primary care practice by some medical students. 26
The impact of rising student debt on graduates’ ability to practice in primary care is not limited to physicians. Tara, a nurse working in primary care at a community health clinic told us she “could not in good conscience recommend primary care as a career choice for others” due to her student debt burden. 27

Many graduates pursuing careers in many public service professions share the same concerns. One borrower told us how she was unable to find a repayment plan that made her debt manageable and ultimately chose to abandon her career as a teacher in order to pursue more lucrative work in the private sector. 28 Recent research has shown that for every $10,000 in additional student debt, young graduates are 6% less likely to pursue a career in public service, especially careers as teachers. 29

Classroom teachers submitted letters detailing the impact of private student loan debt, for which forgiveness programs or income-based repayment options are usually not offered. One school district official wrote to the Bureau noting that programs to make student debt more manageable could lead to higher retention of quality teachers. 30

These trends may pose additional challenges to rural communities, where young graduates with already-strained household balance sheets may have limited access to affordable rental housing and may discover that car ownership is a prerequisite for employment. With many rural medical professionals operating in solo practices, high debt levels might reduce availability to secure initial financing.

Student debt can also impact the availability of other professions critical to the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers in rural communities. According to an annual survey conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association, 89 percent of veterinary students are graduating with debt, averaging $151,672 per borrower. 31 Veterinarians encumbered with high debt burdens may be unable to make ends meet in a dairy medicine or livestock management practice in remote areas.

Accountability for Student Loan Servicers

Loan servicers are the primary point of contact on student loans for more than 40 million Americans. High-quality servicing can contribute to an individual borrower’s ability to successfully repay their debt, especially through enrollment into affordable repayment plans.

As the recession decimated the job market for young graduates, a growing share of student loan borrowers reached out to their servicers for help. But the problems they have encountered bear an uncanny resemblance to the problems faced by struggling homeowners when dealing with their mortgage servicers. Like many of the improper and unnecessary foreclosures experienced by many homeowners, I am concerned that inadequate servicing has contributed to America’s growing student loan default problem, now topping 7 million Americans in default on over $100 billion in balances.

The Bureau has received thousands of complaints from borrowers describing the difficulties they face with their student loan servicers. Borrowers have told the Bureau about a range of problems, from payment processing errors to servicing transfer surprises to loan modification challenges. To ensure that we do not see a repeat of the breakdowns and chaos in the mortgage servicing market, it will be critical to ensure that student loan servicers are providing adequate customer service and following the law.

Canary in the Coal Mine

In the mortgage market, a particularly disconcerting occurrence involved the foreclosures faced by active-duty servicemembers, despite prohibitions under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). Like in the mortgage market, the treatment of servicemembers by student loan servicers has been quite troubling. Rather than receiving clear and accurate information, many military families have found themselves buried in and blindfolded by red tape from their student loan servicers.

My colleague Holly Petraeus, who leads the Bureau’s Office of Servicemember Affairs, and I also published a report describing the obstacles military families face when attempting to access their student loan repayment benefits provided by applicable laws. 32 For example, men and women in uniform are entitled to a 6 percent rate cap on their student loans incurred prior to entering active-duty status, as provided for by the SCRA. Unfortunately, some servicers have placed inappropriate requirements on servicemembers seeking the rate cap.

For example, one servicemember who filed a complaint with the Bureau saw his request to his servicer rejected multiple times because his military orders did not include an end date. This is neither a requirement of the SCRA, nor feasible for many military commissioned officers to obtain, as their orders usually do not delineate an end date. Another servicemember with multiple loans sought to reduce the rate on his highest-rate loans, but, simultaneously, the servicer proceeded to raise the rate on the loans that were below 6 percent.

Improper and potentially unlawful servicing errors can cause harm to servicemembers. Admittedly, military families are a small segment of the population. But if a servicer is unable to provide adequate service to those who have special protections under the law, it raises questions about whether it is agile enough to deal with the complexities of the larger population of borrowers facing hardship.

Strengthening Student Loan Servicing

Unlike most markets for consumer products and services, student loan borrowers generally don’t get to choose their student loan servicer. And with few opportunities to refinance with a new provider, a consumer cannot easily take his or her business elsewhere. Ordinary market forces won’t guarantee reasonable customer service, while potentially magnifying incentives to cut corners.

The past decade offers a useful case study about the potential impact of conflicting incentives. In 2004, the Department of the Treasury finalized the privatization of the Student Loan Marketing Association, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) better known as Sallie Mae. This year, SLM Corp., the GSE’s successor company, ceased operating in its current form. 33

During the ten years the successor corporation operated, it generated substantial revenue through government contracts for student loan servicing and debt collection. The company also benefitted from several government-supported emergency programs as problems in the capital markets emerged. 34 Despite these benefits received from the public, the corporation was found to be violating the law on multiple occasions by state authorities, 35 banking regulators, 36 and federal auditors. 37

And just last month, after referrals from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and the FDIC ordered Sallie Mae and Navient to pay nearly $100 million in restitution and penalties for violating multiple laws. Regulators determined 38 that the companies were:

Unfairly conditioning receipt of benefits under the SCRA upon requirements not found in the law
Improperly advising servicemembers that they must be deployed to receive benefits under the SCRA
Failing to provide complete SCRA relief to servicemembers after having been put on notice of these borrowers’ active duty status
Inadequately disclosing its payment allocation methodologies to borrowers while allocating borrowers’ payments across multiple loans in a manner that maximizes late fees
Misrepresenting and inadequately disclosing in its billing statements how borrowers could avoid late fees
The FDIC also noted in the consent order that there were violations of additional consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. 39

While the post-GSE corporation no longer operates in the form it took immediately post-privatization, the challenges it experienced offer a reminder that regulators must be vigilant to protect consumers, since ordinary market forces in the student loan market may not fully align incentives among all market participants.

The Bureau recently finalized a rule that will allow the agency to supervise larger nonbank student loan servicers, closing a significant gap in oversight for compliance with federal consumer financial laws.

In a recent report analyzing student loan complaints related to payment processing and servicing transfers, I recommended that Congress consider the applicability of recent reforms to the credit card and mortgage servicing markets to determine whether they might help the student loan servicing market function more efficiently. 40

For example, many consumers who wish to pay down their loans more quickly find that student loan servicers allocate payments in ways that might increase the amount of total interest they will pay, slowing them down on the path to be debt-free. For credit card borrowers with balances at multiple rates, generally, prepayments are allocated to balances at the highest interest rate, facilitating faster repayment of debt with minimal bureaucratic burden.

Refinance and Restructure

For borrowers who graduated into a difficult labor market, high student debt burdens have added insult to injury. Borrowers and industry observers have repeatedly noted that, unlike other markets, refinance opportunities are few and far between. In a report published last May, we discussed ways to jumpstart a student loan refinance market and spur loan restructuring. 41

Among borrowers who have dutifully managed their monthly payments on high-interest student loans, many told us that they would like an opportunity to refinance. When mortgage borrowers see rates plummet, their incomes rise, or their credit profiles improve, they try to refinance. Responsible student loan borrowers rarely have these options. Fortunately, since our May 2013 report, we have seen some market participants expand their offerings to borrowers, offering them lower rates that can lead to substantial savings over the life of the loan. 42

While the vast majority of outstanding student loan debt is guaranteed or directly lent by the federal government, solutions to promote affordability of student loans must consider the role of private student loans. High-debt borrowers graduating amidst the financial crisis disproportionately used private student loans. According to an analysis of borrowers graduating from a four-year college in 2008 with more than $40,000 in debt, 81% used private student loans. 43

Unlike federal student loans, which include a range of loan modification options to keep payments affordable, private student loan borrowers rarely have these options. The report describes ways to create a uniform framework for borrowers to restructure their private student loans so loan restructuring activity can be dramatically increased, while simultaneously reducing borrower distress.

BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, noted that “initiatives targeted at young workers with high levels of student indebtedness, perhaps surprisingly to some, have an outsize impact in supporting the housing recovery and financial markets.” 44 More robust refinancing and loan restructuring that reduces the burden of student debt can benefit borrowers, market participants, and the economy more broadly.

Demystify with Data and Transparency

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen once noted that, prior to the crisis, financial regulators “missed some of the important linkages whereby problems in mortgages would rebound through the financial system.” 45 The opacity and our collective lack of understanding of the mortgage market had serious consequences for the economy.

While there have been major strides to better assemble mortgage data, the opacity of the student loan market remains deeply problematic, adding further uncertainty over the potential spillovers into the rest of the economy. I am quite concerned that financial regulators and the public lack access to basic, fundamental data on student loan origination and performance. Without these data, we will be challenged to understand the complete set of risks posed by student debt burdens.

Most loan-level mortgage origination data is currently subject to public disclosure, stripped of borrower-identifiable information, under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 46 Data from housing GSEs and mortgage-backed securities filings shed significant light on loan-level performance. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regularly publishes a mortgage metrics report, detailing loan modification performance and other key servicing data. 47

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council collects reports from insured depository institutions on balance sheet holdings, but student loans are aggregated with many other types of non-mortgage credit products. SEC filings from large financial institutions rarely report key data on student loans. Student loan ABS filings and servicer performance reports are much less granular than similar mortgage reports. Unsurprisingly, the drivers of prepayment, delinquency, and default in the student loan market are not well understood by investors and financial analysts. Questionable accuracy of student loan credit reporting data adds further uncertainty.

We must also seek to better understand how student debt is distributed among various segments of the population. The American Association of University Women, citing its 2012 analysis of borrower debt burden, noted that a much higher portion of female college graduates are shouldering heavy debt burdens relative to their income, compared to similarly-situated males. 48

According to the College Board, 49 black students graduating from college in 2008 at the onset of the financial crisis were more likely to have higher levels of debt than other students. Black students were more likely to use private student loans. 50 In addition, an analysis of the Current Population Survey from the Center for Economic and Policy Research reveals that unemployment for black recent college graduates was more than double that of the entire population of recent college graduates in 2013. Even black recent college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields experienced higher than average unemployment. Differences in underemployment rates also showed similar trends. 51 Understanding both loan usage and employment patterns can help determine borrower populations where distress may be more acute.

The Bureau is coordinating with other regulators on potential ways to enhance the quality of publicly-reported data. Over the longer term, we must aim to reduce the transparency gap between the mortgage and student loan markets. This can lead to more efficient market monitoring and shed light on the linkages between student indebtedness and other sectors of the economy. Better data and transparency will help us to better understand the demographics and professions where borrowers may be experiencing distress, as well as whether lenders and servicers are fairly serving their customers.

Preserving the Dream

Our country was built on the promise that if each of us played our part, contributed our labor, our enterprise and our knowledge, the only limit to our success was our own work ethic. College has served as a gateway to opportunity for millions to climb the ladder and achieve their dreams. And the individual rewards of our hard work – owning a car, buying our first home, and securing a comfortable retirement – continue to define the American dream.

But in the aftermath of the Great Recession, behind all of the facts and statistics, is a much broader question – how do we preserve the drive to succeed for so many who feel that the dream is now out of reach?

For borrowers like Andrea, student debt is a direct threat. She writes, “How can someone even dream of taking out a mortgage to purchase a home when she is struggling to pay back student debt? How can a person think of starting a family if he already owes so much money? How can a potential entrepreneur take the risk to start her dream business when she knows that failure will not only mean losing that investment, but everything else as well? We go to college to open doors, to pursue what we truly want out of a fulfilling life. Massive student debt debilitates this mission.” 52

Ignoring the warning signs may prove to hold back not only the future growth and dynamism of our economy, but also our spirits. Addressing these concerns in the near-term may pay dividends for many years to follow.

Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s hearing, and I look forward to discussing potential solutions to help borrowers climb the economic ladder and stop the student debt domino effect.

By Alice Chang, Dubis Correal, and Holly Zaharchuk – NOV 22, 2017
SHARE & PRINT

More than one out of every 12 people over the age of five in the U.S. are limited English proficient (LEP), meaning that they speak English less than very well, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey One-Year Estimates. LEP consumers may find it difficult to access financial products and services.

Today, we are releasing a report to share some current practices and raise awareness about issues that many LEP consumers face when participating in the financial marketplace.

The CFPB’s prior work has indicated that many of the challenges LEP consumers encounter are often related to language access and financial literacy. Financial disclosures and written documents may not be available in languages other than English. These documents can be technical and difficult to understand, even for proficient English speakers.

LEP consumers may also face challenges with completing key financial documents, managing bank accounts, resolving problems with financial products, and accessing financial education. 

Identifying ways to improve how services are provided to LEP consumers can benefit both consumers and entities providing financial products and services.

Five common themes 

In seeking to learn more about entities’ practices in this area, we spoke with a number of financial institutions of varying sizes about how they serve LEP consumers. It is important to note that the practices described in this report are not exhaustive and that this document is not intended to interpret federal consumer financial law or any other statute or rule and should not be construed as a mandate, guidance, or a requirement. These are five common steps that some financial institutions told us they have taken to better serve LEP consumers.

Assessing the language needs of consumers

Many institutions that we spoke with indicated that they review demographic data about the areas they serve from various sources—such as the U.S. Census Bureau—to determine their customers’ likely language preferences. Some institutions with a national footprint largely focus their resources on building out capabilities to serve Spanish-speaking consumers, while regional institutions told us that they may align their language-focused resources with local demographics.

Providing centralized technical support for language-related initiatives

Many larger institutions that provide language services told us that they have a central point of contact that provides internal technical assistance to the institution’s employees on any language-related initiatives. Depending on the institution, some functions of the central point of contact may include:

Annually reviewing processes and procedures for using non-English languages
Evaluating which areas of business would most benefit from LEP services
Developing quality control mechanisms
Establishing translation and interpretation policies
Developing translation and interpretation systems 

Most of the larger institutions that provide language services told us that they have systems for written translation and verbal interpretation to help ensure consistency and accuracy. Many of these institutions translate for meaning, rather than word-for-word, and use back-translation. Back-translation involves taking a translated document and having another party translate it back to English. These activities validate third-party translations. Financial institutions also told us that they use internal or external bilingual glossaries to keep terms consistent throughout translations. Some institutions use various technological solutions to assist with translations and interpretations, and sometimes they use third-party vendors.

Training staff and contractors in language and cultural competencies

Institutions that provide language services reported that they use various methods to ensure that staff and contractors have the necessary language and cultural understanding to serve LEP consumers. Some institutions hire employees with foreign language fluency, cultural competency, and financial expertise. These institutions told us that they often require either an internal or external certification for written and verbal competency. Institutions that rely primarily on third-party translators or interpreters often retain some language experts on staff to provide quality control.

Offering platforms for interacting with LEP consumers

Institutions that provide language services shared a range of approaches that they use when they interact with LEP consumers in their preferred language in different settings. Many institutions provide verbal interpretation via phone and multiple language settings on their digital services and access points. Most of the institutions reported that their written contracts or agreements were available only in English.

How we can help

The CFPB is working to help all consumers, including non- and limited English-speaking consumers, navigate the financial marketplace. Our U.S.-based contact centers provide services to consumers in more than 180 languages. We also have free printable financial education materials in up to nine languages, including English and Spanish. Among those resources is our Your Home Loan Toolkit, which provides a step-by-step guide to shopping for a mortgage and buying a home.

HMDA data comparisons across multiple ...",https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/summary-of-2022-data-on-mortgage-lending/,"Summary of 2022 Data on Mortgage Lending
JUN 29, 2023

This summary provides information about the data on 2022 mortgage lending transactions at 4,460 U.S. financial institutions reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Covered institutions include banks, savings associations, credit unions, and mortgage companies.

The HMDA data are the most comprehensive publicly available information on mortgage market activity. They are used by industry, consumer groups, regulators, and others to assess potential fair lending risks and for other purposes.

Understanding the Data

The data include a total of 48 data points providing information about the applicants, the property securing the loan or proposed to secure the loan in the case of non-originated applications, the transaction, and identifiers. A complete list of HMDA data points and the associated data fields is found in the FFIEC’s Filing Instructions Guide for HMDA Data Collected in 2022 . Certain smaller-volume financial institutions are not required to report all of these data, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA).1

The 2022 HMDA data use the census tract delineations, population, and housing characteristic data from the 2020 Census. In addition, the data reflect metropolitan statistical area (MSA) definitions released by the Office of Management and Budget in 2020 that became effective for HMDA purposes in 2021.

HMDA data comparisons across multiple years may be limited by changes in HMDA definitions, values, and thresholds. Also, comparisons for certain geographic areas are limited due to the changes in MSA and census tract boundaries and updates to the population and housing characteristics of census tracts, especially those that follow the decennial census and five-year updates based on the American Community Survey (ACS) data.

Among other uses, the data help the public assess how financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their local communities and facilitate federal financial regulators’ fair lending, consumer compliance, and Community Reinvestment Act examinations. For example, when these regulators evaluate an institution’s fair lending risk, they analyze HMDA data in conjunction with other information and risk factors, in accordance with the Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures .

HMDA data are generally not used alone to determine whether a lender is complying with fair lending laws. The data do not include some legitimate credit risk considerations for loan approval and loan pricing decisions. Therefore, when regulators conduct fair lending examinations, they analyze additional information before reaching a determination about an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws.

Observations from the 2022 Data2

For 2022, the number of reporting institutions increased by about 2.8 percent from the previous year to 4,460.

The 2022 data include information on 14.3 million home loan applications. Among them, 11.5 million were closed-end, 2.5 million were open-end, and, for another 287,000 records, pursuant to the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions, financial institutions did not indicate whether the records were closed-end or open-end. The number of closed-end loan applications decreased by 45.7 percent, and the number of open-end line of credit applications increased by 39.3 percent. A total of 8.4 million applications resulted in loan originations. Among them, 6.8 million were closed-end mortgage originations, 1.4 million were open-end line of credit originations, and, pursuant to the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions, 221,000 were originations for which financial institutions did not indicate whether they were closed-end or open-end. The 2022 data include 1.6 million purchased loans, for a total of 16.1 million records. The total also includes information on approximately 201,000 preapproval requests that were denied or approved but not accepted.

The total number of originated closed-end loans decreased by about 7.0 million between 2021 and 2022, or 50.7 percent.3 Closed-end refinance originations for 1-4 family properties decreased by 72.8 percent from 8.4 million, and closed-end, 1-4 family home purchase lending decreased by 19.1 percent from 5.3 million.4

A total of 1,406 reporters made use of the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions for at least one of the 26 data points eligible for the exemptions. In all, they account for about 300,000 records and 218,000 originations.

From 2021 to 2022, the share of closed-end home purchase loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to low- or moderate-income borrowers (those with income of less than 80 percent of area median income) decreased slightly from 28.7 percent to 27.9 percent, and the share of closed-end refinance loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties increased from 24.0 percent to 35.4 percent.

In terms of borrower race and ethnicity, the share of closed-end home purchase loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to Black borrowers rose from 7.9 percent in 2021 to 8.1 percent in 2022, the share made to Hispanic-White borrowers decreased slightly from 9.2 percent to 9.1 percent, and those made to Asian borrowers increased from 7.1 percent to 7.6 percent. From 2021 to 2022, the share of closed-end refinance loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to Black borrowers increased from 5.4 percent to 8.1 percent, the share made to Hispanic-White borrowers increased from 6.1 percent to 7.0 percent, and the share made to Asian borrowers decreased from 6.0 percent to 3.6 percent.

In 2022, Black and Hispanic-White applicants experienced denial rates for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied conventional, closed-end home purchase loans of 16.4 percent and 11.1 percent respectively, while the denial rates for Asian and non-Hispanic-White applicants were 9.2 and 5.8 respectively. These relationships are similar to those found in earlier years and, due to the limitations of the HMDA data mentioned above, cannot take into account all legitimate credit risk considerations for loan approval and loan pricing.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured share of closed-end first-lien home purchase loans for 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties decreased slightly from 17.2 percent in 2021 to 16.3 percent in 2022. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed share of such loans increased slightly to 10.2 percent in 2022. The overall government-backed share of such home purchase loans, including FHA, VA, Rural Housing Service, and Farm Service Agency loans, was 28.1 percent in 2022, down from 29.3 percent in 2021.

The FHA-insured share of closed-end refinance mortgages for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties increased to 10.4 percent in 2022 from 6.9 percent in 2021, while the VA-guaranteed share of such refinance loans decreased from 10.2 percent in 2021 to 9.5 percent in 2022.

The share of mortgages originated by non-depository, independent mortgage companies has increased in recent years. In 2022, this group of lenders accounted for 72.1 percent of first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied, closed-end home-purchase loans, up from 63.9 percent in 2021. Independent mortgage companies also originated 62.1 percent of first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied, closed-end refinance loans, a decrease from 65.7 percent in 2021.

The HMDA data also identify loans that are covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Under HOEPA, certain types of mortgage loans that have interest rates or total points and fees above specified levels are subject to certain requirements, such as additional disclosures to consumers, and also are subject to various restrictions on loan terms. For 2022, 7,087 loan originations covered by HOEPA were reported: 3,506 home purchase loans for 1-4 family properties; 272 home improvement loans for 1-4 family properties; and 3,309 refinance loans for 1-4 family properties.

This summary provides information about the data on 2021 mortgage lending transactions at 4,338 U.S. financial institutions reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Covered institutions include banks, savings associations, credit unions, and mortgage companies.

The HMDA data are the most comprehensive publicly available information on mortgage market activity. They are used by industry, consumer groups, regulators, and others to assess potential fair lending risks and for other purposes.

Observations from the 2021 Data2

For 2021, the number of reporting institutions declined by about 3.1 percent from the previous year to 4,338.

The 2021 data include information on 23.3 million home loan applications. Among them, 21.1 million were closed-end, 1.8 million were open-end, and, for another 350,000 records, pursuant to the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions, financial institutions did not indicate whether the records were closed-end or open-end. The number of closed-end loan applications increased by 3.6 percent, and the number of open-end line of credit applications increased by 7.0 percent. A total of 15.0 million applications resulted in loan originations. Among them, 13.7 million were closed-end mortgage originations, 1.0 million were open-end line of credit originations, and, pursuant to the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions, 268,000 were originations for which financial institutions did not indicate whether they were closed-end or open-end. The 2021 data include 2.7 million purchased loans, for a total of 26.1 million records. The total also includes information on approximately 148,000 preapproval requests that were denied or approved but not accepted.

The total number of originated closed-end loans increased by about 528,000 between 2020 and 2021, or 4.0 percent.3 Closed-end refinance originations for 1-4 family properties decreased by 1.4 percent from 8.5 million, and closed-end, 1-4 family home purchase lending increased by 9.2 percent from 4.8 million.4

A total of 1,365 reporters made use of the EGRRCPA’s partial exemptions for at least one of the 26 data points eligible for the exemptions. In all, they account for about 380,000 records and 277,000 originations.

From 2020 to 2021, the share of closed-end home purchase loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to low- or moderate-income borrowers (those with income of less than 80 percent of area median income) decreased slightly from 30.4 percent to 28.7 percent, and the share of closed-end refinance loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties increased from 18.9 percent to 24.0 percent.

In terms of borrower race and ethnicity, the share of closed-end home purchase loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to Black borrowers rose from 7.3 percent in 2020 to 7.9 percent in 2021, the share made to Hispanic-White borrowers increased slightly from 9.1 percent to 9.2 percent, and those made to Asian borrowers increased from 5.5 percent to 7.1 percent. From 2020 to 2021, the share of closed-end refinance loans for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties made to Black borrowers increased from 4.2 percent to 5.4 percent, the share made to Hispanic-White borrowers increased from 5.3 percent to 6.1 percent, and the share made to Asian borrowers decreased from 6.7 percent to 6.0 percent.

In 2021, Black and Hispanic-White applicants experienced denial rates for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied conventional, closed-end home purchase loans of 15.7 percent and 9.8 percent respectively, while the denial rates for Asian and non-Hispanic-White applicants were 7.5 and 5.6 respectively. These relationships are similar to those found in earlier years and, due to the limitations of the HMDA data mentioned above, cannot take into account all legitimate credit risk considerations for loan approval and loan pricing.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured share of closed-end first-lien home purchase loans for 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties decreased slightly from 19.4 percent in 2020 to 17.2 percent in 2021. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed share of such loans decreased slightly to 9.7 percent in 2021. The overall government-backed share of such home purchase loans, including FHA, VA, Rural Housing Service, and Farm Service Agency loans, was 29.3 percent in 2021, down from 32.8 percent in 2020.

The FHA-insured share of closed-end refinance mortgages for first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied properties increased to 6.9 percent in 2021 from 6.2 percent in 2020, while the VA-guaranteed share of such refinance loans decreased from 11.9 percent in 2020 to 10.2 percent in 2021.

The share of mortgages originated by non-depository, independent mortgage companies has increased in recent years. In 2021, this group of lenders accounted for 63.9 percent of first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied, closed-end home-purchase loans, up from 60.7 percent in 2020. Independent mortgage companies also originated 65.7 percent of first lien, 1-4 family, site-built, owner-occupied, closed-end refinance loans, an increase from 63.1 percent in 2020.

The HMDA data also identify loans that are covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Under HOEPA, certain types of mortgage loans that have interest rates or total points and fees above specified levels are subject to certain requirements, such as additional disclosures to consumers, and also are subject to various restrictions on loan terms. For 2021, 6,518 loan originations covered by HOEPA were reported: 3,314 home purchase loans for 1-4 family properties; 393 home improvement loans for 1-4 family properties; and 2,811 refinance loans for 1-4 family properties.

Many HSAs suffer from low interest rate yields and junk fees to switch

MAY 01, 2024
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today released a report detailing the complex costs and fees that many consumers with health savings accounts are forced to pay. There were approximately 36 million health savings accounts in 2023 – holding more than $116 billion. These accounts provide tax benefits to help offset the costs of high deductible health plans. However, these benefits are being offset by charges like monthly maintenance fees, paper statement fees, outbound transfer fees, and account closure fees. Today’s report is part of the CFPB’s continuing efforts to reduce the risks and costs brought by financial institutions as they increase their presence in the American healthcare system.

“Health savings accounts are promoted for the tax benefits that chip away at the price tag of health care,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Many consumers do not realize the fees, switching costs, and low interest yields that will come with the accounts.”    

A health savings account is a tax-advantaged account that generally comes with a high deductible health plan. Typically, a health savings account is in the form of a deposit account selected by an employer or a health insurance company. An employee makes tax-deductible contributions that can then be used for certain health care expenses. Unspent contributions can earn interest, and roll over each year. The individual and family contribution limits for 2024 are $4,150 and $8,300, respectively.

Health savings accounts today hold more than $116 billion, a 500 percent increase since 2013. Additionally, the number of accounts rose more than three times from 2013 to 2023, 11.8 million to 35 million, respectively. The significant growth in the accounts has coincided with the rising use of high deductible health plans.

Consumers have reported a range of concerns with health savings accounts. For some consumers, these accounts come with high costs. Employers often decide on the financial service provider that will manage employees’ health savings accounts. The factors that motivate employers can differ from those of employees. Providers design health savings accounts to compete for employers. The result is that health savings accounts can often present challenges and costs for consumers, such as surprise fees, lack of fund portability, and low-yield interest rates.

When a consumer ends up with a health savings account with high fees and inferior terms, it directly reduces the funds they can allocate to their health care needs. High deductible health plans have higher deductibles than other health plans, so many individuals with these plans, such as people with chronic illnesses, experience higher upfront out-of-pocket health care costs.

High costs and fees can quickly erode a consumer’s ability to pay medical bills. In the case of health savings accounts such fees and costs can also erode tax savings. Specifically, the CFPB’s report found:

Costly, complex, and captive junk fee structures: Many providers that offer health savings accounts charge various fees, including monthly maintenance fees and paper statement fees. Expensive exit fees, like outbound transfer fees and account closure fees, can hold consumers, who may not have selected their accounts, captive to their current providers. The fees are costly and typically unavoidable.
Low interest yields: Despite the recent increase in interest rates across the United States most providers offer consistently low interest rates. Typically, these rates are less than 1%, and, sometimes, even 0%. As a result, consumers could incur significantly more in fees than they earn in interest.

The CFPB has been working to reduce the financial consequences of medical debts as well as to ensure consumers are treated fairly by providers participating in the health care sphere. In September 2023, the CFPB initiated a rulemaking to remove medical bills from many credit reports. In July 2023, the CFPB, along with other federal agencies, launched an inquiry into costly credit cards and loans pushed on patients to pay for health care costs.

Radjabli placed customer funds in risky investment vehicles and crypto-assets, including the now-defunct Celsius Network

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action against Loan Doctor to resolve the CFPB’s claims that the company and its founder, Edgar Radjabli, broke the law by deceiving consumers into thinking they were depositing funds into a guaranteed return savings product within a commercial bank. Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that deposited funds would be used to originate loans for healthcare professionals, would be held in insured accounts or backed by cash alternatives, and would yield interest rates between 5% and 6.25%. If approved by the court, the proposed settlement would require the defendants to refund all the deposits made, including all interest due to consumers. The defendants would also pay a civil money penalty, and be permanently banned from engaging or assisting others in any deposit taking activities. Radjabli has been separately charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“Loan Doctor and its founder masqueraded as a traditional bank to open accounts for people seeking a high-yield savings product,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “In reality, this outfit and its ringleader were using customer funds for risky investments.”

My Loan Doctor, which does business as Loan Doctor, is a Delaware financial services company operating in West Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City. Loan Doctor purported to offer customers a Healthcare Finance Savings CD account that would yield, according to the company, “the highest return of any savings product in the US.” In addition to being its founder, Edgar Radjabli, was an officer of Loan Doctor and responsible for its management.

The CFPB alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli made several false, misleading, and inaccurate marketing representations in advertising Loan Doctor’s Healthcare Finance Savings CD account. Starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took millions of dollars from at least 400 individuals who opened and deposited money into Loan Doctor’s deceptively advertised savings product. Specifically, Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that:

Customer deposits would originate loans for healthcare professionals: Loan Doctor and Radjabli told depositors that when it originated a loan, it would have an investor lined up to purchase it. In fact, Loan Doctor never used the deposits to originate loans for healthcare professionals, and it never entered into a contract with a buyer or investor to purchase a loan.
Customer deposits would be secure: Loan Doctor represented that when not being used to originate loans, deposited funds would be held in an FDIC-insured account or an account insured by Lloyd’s of London, or backed by a “cash alternative” or “cash equivalent.” Loan Doctor also stated that it maintained a cash reserve in an amount equivalent to the amount customers deposited. CFPB’s investigation found that Radjabli instead placed funds in a hedge fund he controlled and in crypto-assets, such as Celsius Network. Deposited funds were also invested in actively traded securities or loaned, through a third party, to investors using individual stock portfolios as collateral.
Loan Doctor was a commercial bank: Loan Doctor misled customers to believe they were depositing their funds into accounts like traditional savings accounts that had guaranteed returns. In fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank, and depositors’ funds were invested in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.
Healthcare Finance High-Yield CD accounts had a record of paying high interest rates: Loan Doctor stated that the accounts paid interest at rates between 5% and 6.25% in years prior to 2019. In fact, Loan Doctor did not begin taking consumer deposits until August 2019.
Enforcement Action

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The proposed settlement, if approved by the court, would require Loan Doctor and Radjabli to:

Refund approximately $19 million to approximately 400 depositors: The defendants would have to return the money that each affected person deposited into a Loan Doctor Healthcare Finance High Yield CD account, and in a manner consistent with the advertised terms of the product – namely, the principal along with an average per year interest rate of about 6%.
Stop engaging in deposit taking activities: The defendants would be permanently banned from engaging or assisting others in any deposit taking activities.
Pay a $391,530 fine: The order would require defendants to pay a civil money penalty to the CFPB in the amount of $391,530. A portion of that penalty, $241,530, will be remitted because the defendants paid that amount in penalties to the SEC due to a similar action brought by that agency. The remainder of the penalty would be deposited into the CFPB’s victims relief fund.

Read today’s proposed order. 

Consumers can submit complaints about financial products or services by visiting the CFPB’s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).

Employees of companies who they believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.

Many HSAs suffer from low interest rate yields and junk fees to switch

MAY 01, 2024
SHARE & PRINT

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today released a report detailing the complex costs and fees that many consumers with health savings accounts are forced to pay. There were approximately 36 million health savings accounts in 2023 – holding more than $116 billion. These accounts provide tax benefits to help offset the costs of high deductible health plans. However, these benefits are being offset by charges like monthly maintenance fees, paper statement fees, outbound transfer fees, and account closure fees. Today’s report is part of the CFPB’s continuing efforts to reduce the risks and costs brought by financial institutions as they increase their presence in the American healthcare system.

“Health savings accounts are promoted for the tax benefits that chip away at the price tag of health care,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Many consumers do not realize the fees, switching costs, and low interest yields that will come with the accounts.”    

A health savings account is a tax-advantaged account that generally comes with a high deductible health plan. Typically, a health savings account is in the form of a deposit account selected by an employer or a health insurance company. An employee makes tax-deductible contributions that can then be used for certain health care expenses. Unspent contributions can earn interest, and roll over each year. The individual and family contribution limits for 2024 are $4,150 and $8,300, respectively.

Additionally, the number of accounts rose more than three times from 2013 to 2023, 11.8 million to 35 million, respectively. The significant growth in the accounts has coincided with the rising use of high deductible health plans.

Consumers have reported a range of concerns with health savings accounts. For some consumers, these accounts come with high costs. Employers often decide on the financial service provider that will manage employees’ health savings accounts. The factors that motivate employers can differ from those of employees. Providers design health savings accounts to compete for employers.

Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-02
Deceptive representations involving the FDIC’s name or logo or deposit insurance
Question presented

When do representations involving the name or logo of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or about deposit insurance constitute a deceptive act or practice in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)?

Response

Covered persons or service providers likely violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deception if they misuse the name or logo of the FDIC or engage in false advertising or make misrepresentations to consumers about deposit insurance, regardless of whether such conduct (including the misrepresentation of insured status) is engaged in knowingly. Representations about deposit insurance may be particularly relevant with respect to new financial products or services, especially those involving new technologies such as digital assets, including crypto-assets.

Analysis

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau administers a number of laws and regulations relating to the offering or providing of deposit accounts, including these provisions:1

The Truth in Savings Act and its implementing regulation (Regulation DD), which enable consumers to make informed decisions about their accounts at depository institutions through the use of uniform disclosures;2
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing regulation (Regulation E), which protect consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers and remittance transfers;3
Portions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and its implementing regulations, which require depository institutions lacking Federal deposit insurance to make certain disclosures;4
The CFPA, which, among other things, prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.5

Deposit insurance has long been a means to promote confidence in the banking system. The most common form of deposit insurance is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).6 The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured banks and savings associations up to the maximum deposit insurance amount, currently $250,000, per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category.7

Representations about deposit insurance may be particularly relevant with respect to new financial products or services, especially those involving new technologies such as digital assets, including crypto-assets. New technologies may yield significant benefits for consumers, workers, and small businesses. Nonetheless, especially with respect to new technologies, some market participants may seek to entice consumers to use their products or services by deceptively advertising that uninsured products or services are FDIC-insured. These misrepresentations disadvantage financial institutions that truthfully market FDIC-insured accounts to consumers. Such misrepresentations also harm consumers, who may find that their assets are not insured in a time of financial distress.

The CFPB is issuing this Circular to emphasize that covered persons and service providers are required to comply with the CFPA with respect to representations to consumers involving the name or logo of the FDIC and representations about deposit insurance. The CFPB is issuing this Circular in connection with the FDIC’s adoption of a regulation on related subject matter involving section 18(a)(4) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(a)(4).8 Thus, the Circular is particularly focused on misrepresentations to consumers about FDIC insurance. This Circular describes certain misrepresentations to consumers that can violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices in connection with a transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service.9 This Circular notes that misrepresentations to consumers may violate the CFPA regardless of whether they are made knowingly.

Section 18(a)(4) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(a)(4), prohibits any person from engaging in false advertising or misusing the name or logo of the FDIC to represent or imply that uninsured deposits are FDIC-insured and from making knowing misrepresentations about the extent or manner of deposit insurance provided to any deposits.10 Under the CFPA, covered persons and service providers are prohibited from committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice in connection with the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service.11 A covered person includes any person that engages in offering or providing financial products or services for use by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.12 Financial products or services are defined to include, for example, engaging in deposit-taking activities, transmitting or exchanging funds, or otherwise acting as a custodian of funds or any financial instrument for use by or on behalf of a consumer, as well as (subject to certain exceptions) selling, providing, or issuing stored value or payment instruments.13

Material misrepresentations are “deceptive” practices in violation of the CFPA.14 Like FDI Act section 18(a)(4)(A), which prohibits any false advertising or misuse of the name or logo of the FDIC, but unlike under FDI Act section 18(a)(4)(B), which prohibits knowing misrepresentations regarding the extent or manner that deposits are insured, a misrepresentation to consumers may violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deception regardless of whether the misrepresentation was made knowingly.15 Additionally, disclaimers may not cure otherwise deceptive messages or practices.

Covered persons or service providers likely violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deception if they misuse the name or logo of the FDIC or engage in false advertising or make misrepresentations to consumers about deposit insurance, regardless of whether such conduct (including the misrepresentation of insured status) is engaged in knowingly. Representations made by covered persons or service providers about FDIC insurance will typically be material.16 Accordingly, for example, if a person engages in or purports to engage in deposit-taking activity by accepting (or offering to accept) funds for use by consumers, and that person misrepresents that such funds are insured by the FDIC, that person likely violates the CFPA’s prohibition on deception, even if the misrepresentation was not made knowingly. Similarly deceptive are claims that consumer financial products or services are “regulated” by the FDIC or “insured” or “eligible for” FDIC insurance if those claims expressly or implicitly indicate that the product is FDIC-insured when that is not in fact the case. In particular, firms offering or providing digital assets, including crypto-assets, may be particularly prone to making such deceptive claims to consumers about FDIC deposit insurance coverage.

Certain categories of information are presumed to be material. In general, information about the central characteristics of a consumer financial product or service – such as costs, benefits, or restrictions on the use or availability – is presumed to be material. Express claims made with respect to a consumer financial product or service are presumed material. Implied claims are presumed to be material when evidence shows that the institution intended to make the claim (even though intent to deceive is not necessary for deception to exist). Omissions will be presumed to be material when the financial institution knew or should have known that the consumer needed the omitted information to evaluate the product or service.

Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Learn more about ways to pay off your student loan debt.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

Questions to ask your servicer about rehabilitation and consolidation
Questions to ask your servicer about pausing student loan payments
You have other options for help
If you have a problem with a student loan, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPB about federal or private student loans.
You can file a complaint with Federal Student Aid  about federal loans. These complaints can be escalated to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group  .
Contact your state attorney general to file a complaint . Your state may also have a student loan ombudsman. Search the name of your state with “student loan ombudsman.”
The student financial aid department at your school may be able to provide guidance."

Your financial well-being, or overall financial situation, is unique to you. Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.

The story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. 

How would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.

Understand where your money goes 

The prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.

1. Take our quiz to see how healthy your finances are.

Answer just 10 questions to measure your financial well-being and get a few steps for making improvements. Take it now, then take it again later to see if your story has changed.

2. Learn where your money is coming from.

Before you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.

3. Learn where your money is going.

Fill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.

4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.

If you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.

Small changes can make a big difference

There are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. 

5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.

Your cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .

6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.

If there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .

7. Compare your spending month-to-month.

Track your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.

Save for emergencies

Saving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. 

8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.

Start by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.

9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.

Set guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.

10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.

Whether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.

11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.

There may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.

12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.

For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.

Reduce your debt 

Paying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.

13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.

Use our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.

14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.

There are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.

15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.

Whether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.

16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

Plan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.

Create better money habits 

Improving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. 

17. Apply only for credit you need.

While it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.

18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.

You’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.

19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.

Through most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.

20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.

Missing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.

21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.

One of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.

Plan for success

Planning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. 

22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.

Break down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.

23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.

If you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.

24. Make your savings consistent.

Putting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .

25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.

Once you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!

If you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.

Consumer risks posed by employer-driven debt

By the CFPB Office for Consumer Populations – JUL 20, 2023

SHARE & PRINT
Executive Summary

After hearing from a number of consumer and worker organizations concerned about the potential impacts of employer-driven debts, the CFPB launched a formal inquiry in June 2022 seeking data about, and worker experiences with, employer-driven debt. The CFPB sought comments from employers, researchers, and workers or other individuals with knowledge or personal experiences pertaining to employer-driven debt to better understand risks to consumers.

This issue spotlight showcases the findings from that inquiry. It presents highlights derived from workers’ individual experiences and examines what market-level research says about employer-driven debts. Key findings include:

There are many ways workers experience unique harms related to employer-driven debts because employer-driven debts are inextricably linked to a worker’s employment, and the worker’s ability to repay the debt is controlled by the issuer of the debt itself.
Based on workers’ reports, there is a risk that employees may be rushed into signing agreements that hide the details of the debt workers are agreeing to, or that employers may even unilaterally change the terms and conditions after origination without workers’ awareness or understanding.
Because workers may be taking on employer-driven debt at times when they are primarily focused on securing or advancing employment, they may focus on questions of pay, hours, work conditions, and opportunities for career growth rather than questions of valuation, disclosures, and terms and conditions of the credit or lease product.
Commenters report that debts are often imposed as a mandatory pre-condition for employment, suggesting employers may impede workers’ ability to consider and negotiate the terms and conditions of employer-driven debt before accepting the job.
Some workers expect that employer-driven debts are structured to help them achieve career mobility and higher earnings, suggesting that employers may misrepresent the value and nature of the employer-driven debt, work conditions, or the earnings of the prospective jobs for which workers are considering incurring debt.
Workers may experience negative impacts on their overall household financial stability as they face lower earnings, damaged credit scores, and additional debts incurred to meet repayment-related obligations.

The CFPB is committed to working with other federal, state, and local regulators with relevant jurisdiction, as appropriate, to ensure that the workplace is not a source of potential consumer harm. The CFPB intends to evaluate the use of training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs) or other employer-driven debts for potential violations of consumer financial laws and is committed to using all its tools to address the risks they may cause for consumers.

Background

Employer-driven debts are arrangements where workers to become indebted to their employer1 or an affiliate as a condition of employment through use of a financial product or service, such as an extension of credit or a lease2, often purporting to cover the costs of training, equipment, supplies, guest worker visa recruitment, or other employment-related expenses. While there is some consistency in the worker experience of these products, they may take different forms in different industries. For example:

In the nursing, retail, financial services, aviation, and trucking industries, new hires and candidates for promotion—even those who have already completed all training necessary to perform the job and required by licensing authorities—are often required to sign provisions requiring repayments for their employers’ or an affiliate’s mandatory training programs if they leave the job before a defined period of time.
In the rideshare, trucking, and janitorial services industries, many workers in purported independent contractor arrangements must lease or take on credit to procure equipment or supplies from their employer or its affiliates.
In industries that employ immigrants on guest work visa programs, such as agriculture and meat processing, many workers are required to sign provisions requiring payment to their employer or its affiliates of fees if they seek to leave their employer before their visa or employment contract expires.
Prevalence

Workers are incurring debts across a number of sectors of the economy. One common form of employer-driven debts are training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs), through which companies require workers to agree to pay back the costs of training if they leave their jobs before the end of a contractual commitment period. Employers’ use of TRAPs began in the 1990s, predominantly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions, such as engineers, securities brokers, and airline pilots .3 Still in use in those industries, they are now also common in lower- and moderate-wage industries where jobs are disproportionately held by women and minorities,4 such as in the healthcare, transportation, and retail industries.5 Commenters noted that other occupations that have been reported to use them are mechanics, hair stylists, bank workers, social workers, and pilots.6

While it’s difficult to estimate how common TRAPs are across the workforce, a study by the Cornell Survey Research Institute found that nearly 10% of American workers surveyed in 2020 were covered by a training repayment agreement7 and the Student Borrower Protection Center estimates that major employers rely upon TRAPs in segments of the U.S. labor market that collectively employ more than one in three private-sector workers.8 A survey of registered nurses conducted by National Nurses United (NNU) shows a dramatic increase in their use: 44.8% of nurses who have been working 5 years or less and 45.3% who have been working between 6-10 years reported having been subject to a TRAP, as compared to 24.3% of those who have been working between 11-20 years and 9.4% who have been working 21 years or more.9

Many businesses and business associations report that the practice of training workers in return for a defined period of service to the company is a mutually-beneficial arrangement, enabling companies to benefit from an improved workforce and workers to benefit from acquiring in-demand and transferable skills.10 But research suggests that the rise in prevalence is attributable to employers’ search for alternative means of discouraging employee turnover as non-compete agreements come under regulation and legal scrutiny, or to the rise in the use of independent contractors to carry out labor previously performed by company employees.11 As described by researchers Mitchell Hoffman and Stephen V. Burks, “To discourage workers from quitting after training, firms often use training contracts: the firm pays for training and workers are fined for premature quitting.” Their study found that, “implementing a training contract reduced quitting by around 15%...These impacts appear to be driven by making employees less likely to quit, as opposed to selecting better employees.”12 One business advice website echoed that justification, writing, “But in the wake of the Great Resignation, a tight labor market and recent ‘quick quitting’ trends, some employers around the U.S. have found a way to TRAP employees into staying with their organizations – by using training repayment agreement provisions (TRAPs).”13

Structure

Because employer-driven debt products are inextricably linked to a worker’s employment, there are many ways the worker’s experience of these products may be atypical as compared to a traditional debt product. For a more conventional credit transaction, consumers may experience a more defined and deliberate process that can include marketing, evaluation of ability to repay, provision of the purported valuation of the product, the terms and conditions for repayment, calculations of amounts to be paid, ways to make payments, and avenues for dispute resolution. In such credit transactions, a consumer might evaluate the impact of the financial product on their disposable income, their ability to make payments toward the debt, and the cost of exiting the financial product.

In the case of employer-driven debts, as discussed more fully in the Consumer Risks section below, workers’ experiences tend to be that of “take-it-or-leave-it” agreements, with no room to seek financing from alternative sources or to negotiate the terms and conditions. In some cases, the debts are held directly by the employer, while in other cases the workers’ debts are held by affiliate companies. Workers may be unaware that they will be required to take on a debt to their employer until after they have incurred expenses such as quitting a previous job or paying to travel to a training site. They may experience high-pressure tactics or have the details of the debt arrangements obscured. Their earnings—and therefore the ability to accrue the funds to repay the debt—are directly controlled by the issuer of the credit itself.

Consumer Risks

The CFPB launched an inquiry in June 2022 seeking data about, and worker experiences with, employer-driven debt. The inquiry sought comments from employers, researchers, workers, or other individuals with knowledge or personal experiences pertaining to employer-driven debt to better understand any risks to consumers.

The majority of the responses received were from individuals, academics, and advocacy organizations; far fewer responses were submitted by employers and industry associations. A full list of submissions is included as an appendix. This section summarizes findings from the comments received in response to the Request for Information.

Risks to workers from employer-driven debts include:

Based on workers’ reports, there is a risk that employees may be rushed into signing agreements that hide the details of the debt workers are agreeing to, or that employers may even unilaterally change the terms and conditions after origination without workers’ awareness or understanding.
Because workers may be taking on employer-driven debt at times when they are primarily focused on securing or advancing employment, they may focus on questions of pay, hours, work conditions, and opportunities for career growth rather than questions of valuation, disclosures, and terms and conditions of the debt product.
Commenters report that debts are often imposed as a mandatory pre-condition for employment, suggesting employers may impede workers’ ability to consider and negotiate the terms and conditions of employer-driven debt before accepting the job.
Some workers expect that employer-driven debts are structured to help them achieve career mobility and higher earnings, suggesting that employers may misrepresent the value and nature of the employer-driven debt, work conditions, or the earnings of the prospective jobs for which workers are considering incurring debt.
Workers may experience negative impacts on their overall household financial stability as they face lower earnings, damaged credit scores, and additional debts incurred to meet repayment-related obligations.
Understanding Terms and Risks

Request for Information responses suggest that employers may be preventing workers from fully understanding the risks, costs, and terms and conditions of the employer-driven debt product to which they are agreeing – and workers may even be entirely unaware they have agreed to a debt product at all to secure their job.

Hidden Details

Request for Information submissions suggest that employers or their agents may not provide sufficient information about the terms and conditions of the credit or lease, with many workers left unsure of the exact amount they owe and the length of employment expected of them, without copies of their contracts, or unaware that their contracts even contained training-repayment provisions. Many respondents in the nursing industry reported that workers had not even received written copies of their contracts. For example, one nurse “believes the contract will be prorated based on the amount of time in the program [but] has never received documentation to confirm that the penalty is prorated for leaving before the end of the contract.”14 Or another who “does not recall receiving a paper copy of the contract. He recalls that terms of the contract were explained to him in passing, not a formal explanation.”15 And still another who “does not know if the contract they signed was a loan or a promissory note, and they do not know who they would have to repay.”16

Even when disclosed, the terms of the agreement may be hidden deep inside employment contracts or written in languages workers cannot comprehend. One respondent described the written agreements for one company’s training as using, “complicated, long run-on sentences phrased in the passive voice” to lay out withholdings and deductions to which the borrower must agree in exchange for the training, making it difficult for most potential pet groomers to recognize the full extent of their financial obligation.17 In many instances, the products do not disclose the total cost of the credit or lease—including any interest, finance charges, or origination costs—and as a result many borrowers are unaware of the total cost of the obligation they are taking on.18 In a 2021 U.S. District Court case against a truck-leasing company, the Magistrate found, “Not all [the drivers] fully understood all portions of the leasing agreement.”19

Changing Terms and Conditions

The terms and conditions may subsequently change after accepting a job, at times to even include the addition of a TRAP when no such requirement was previously disclosed prior to the employment offer. One respondent stated, the employer would “sometimes unilaterally lower the amount of tuition it would agree to cover, leaving the worker on the hook for the difference.”20 Another commenter stated, “One nurse was explicitly told they were not required to be part of a nurse residency program and then two months after starting the job was told they were required to participate in a program with a repayment agreement for $4,000 for a program the nurse described as ‘busy work.’”21 In another case, a respondent reported being unaware a new job would require training which the worker would have to pay for if they left the job before two years, stating,

“[a]fter completing 4 years of schooling and passing technical interviews my first job seemed great. Once onboarding I discovered some ‘training’ was required, no problem at all. However the first day consisted of signing a long employment document in a room with all the other employees that required $10,000 to be paid by us if we leave the company within a year and $5,000 if within 2 years.”22
Unequal Bargaining Power

Respondents reported that workers who understand the debt their employers offer may nevertheless feel that they are powerless to dispute it because they need the job. Even in relatively tight labor markets, but especially in times and places with high unemployment or that are dominated by relatively few employers, job applicants are generally understood to be at a disadvantage compared to the employer—typically needing the job more than the employer needs that particular applicant.23 Responses suggest that employers may be leveraging their advantage to push the worker into taking on the debt, especially workers with limited experience in a new occupation and workers who are financially vulnerable.

Focus on Wages and Work Conditions

Because workers are often focused on the necessity of searching for and finding a new job, their deliberations may be focused on questions of pay, hours, work conditions, and opportunities for career growth, rather than questions of valuation, disclosures, and terms and conditions of the debt product. One respondent explained, “If the agreement is presented alongside reams of other employment paperwork, employers may depend on the ‘lack of salience’ to get workers to sign; unaware of the later ramifications for employment flexibility or wage negotiation power, workers don’t pay attention to these provisions or their terms.”24 Another respondent stated, “Low-wage workers frequently sign their contracts as part of a rushed onboarding process that gives them little time to read the contract that they are signing, let alone actually understand its terms or give due consideration to whether they should sign it. Some workers with limited English proficiency are entirely unable to read the English-only terms.”25 Reporting on the results of the survey of nurses, NNU stated, “When asked whether they knew they were taking on a debt before accepting or continuing employment with their employer, only half of the hospital RNs or APRNs/CCRNs who are or were in TRAPs responded ‘yes.’26

Need for a Job

According to Request for Information submissions, some employers appear to be leveraging their bargaining power to present provisions imposing debt as “take-it-or-leave-it,” or giving workers insufficient time to review or negotiate the agreements before accepting a job. One respondent explained, “even if they had had the opportunity to understand the terms of the agreement, low-wage workers generally have little bargaining power with which to alter the terms set by their employers. Commonly, their only recourse is to turn down a job opportunity altogether when the terms are not favorable, a choice that for many Texas RioGrande Legal Aid clients is simply economically infeasible. And even if a worker does decline employment, there’s no guarantee that he will be able to find a position that does not bind him to similar terms.”27 Similarly, another respondent stated, “Nurses mentioned in survey comments and interviews that they had limited employment options that did not require TRAPs. Some of the nurses who were purposefully avoiding TRAPs struggled to find the few non-TRAP positions available.”28

Many respondents reported that employers or their agents used high-pressure tactics to coerce workers into signing on to employer-driven debt products such as leaving them with the impression the job opportunity would not be available if they took time to deliberate and giving them insufficient time to review the contract terms. One respondent described a situation where, “[t]he meeting with [redacted] in the [redacted] office was the first time [the worker] saw the contract. She felt ‘pressured’ because [redacted] told her that orientation for the fall would be starting soon. She signed the contract on the spot.”29 When USA Today conducted a year-long investigation into the use of employer-driven debt in the trucking industry, they found truckers were given “take-it-or-leave-it” lease-to-own contracts for equipment.30

Additionally, respondents suggest that companies may be recruiting vulnerable workers who may be more likely to accept debt products because of their need for work. As explained by one respondent, “Employers may specifically target immigrants and foreign workers because they know that they can use these workers’ immigration status as a debt-collection tactic.”31 In one example of a company targeting immigrants for employer-driven debt, the Washington State Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the company for deceptive practices, alleging the company unlawfully persuaded primarily immigrant workers to take on large debts to purchase a franchise in order to receive cleaning assignments.32 In another industry, one commenter stated, “I feel [redacted] purposely targets people who don’t have enough money in the first place by talking the position up and the contract down while not giving all the information about the job workers are truly applying for.”33 In the trucking industry, one respondent reported, “Our CDL school students are typically unemployed or underemployed at the time of entry. We understand they have poor credit ratings and few options to access financing.”34

Inability to Repay if Worker Leaves

Respondents also reported that employers restricted workers from leaving their jobs because of the high cost of repaying financial costs related to the employer-driven debt. Many commenters reported that employers invoked their debt as a retort to concerns about work conditions and a strategy to induce them to continue working. One commenter reported, “This contract is something that is constantly dangled over our heads any time we are getting treated like dogs,”35 while another stated, “If I mention being unhappy, my boss replies that they’ll take me to court for the over $5,000 they say I owe since it hasn’t been two years.”36 Still others reported that the threat of repayment had indeed worked to keep them in a job they otherwise intended to leave, with one Request for Information response stating,

“Shortly after they left, Nurse E received a collection letter notifying them that they either pay the hospital $18,000, which was what [company] said was the prorated cost of their training, or complete the two-year/4,000-hour requirement. Nurse E tried to negotiate the payment of the amount they owed, but the hospital refused…Nurse E decided to return to working at [redacted] because of the financial liability.”37

Yet another reported, “The number was around $6500, and the thought of having to pay that back was terrifying…I wanted to quit after the first 2 months, but there was no way I could have ever paid it back.”38

Even if the TRAP is not enforced, its presence has the power to accomplish the intended consequence of pressuring workers into staying. One respondent cited a blog written by a roofing industry association recommending the use of TRAPs, stating, “that while non-competes for workers in the field were likely to be unenforceable, requiring certification training with a reimbursement requirement could help employers get around the prohibition.”39 Another respondent explained, “Because a [redacted] employee does not know whether or not [redacted] will enforce the TRAP until after they have left the company, the chilling effect of the TRAP on employee mobility is universal even when enforcement is inconsistent.”40 One respondent explained that in the commercial trucking industry, “Several students snuck away in the middle of the night, as if escaping some kind of forced labor camp.” But for the remaining students, as University of Pennsylvania sociologist and expert in the American trucking industry Steve Viscelli noted, “…it became obvious that having to pay back the training was the only thing keeping [them] there.”41 Indeed, one study of truck drivers found that a TRAP reduced employee quitting by 15 percent.42 For migrant workers, employers and recruiters may threaten to sue workers for breach of contract fees or take collateral payments, like titles to workers’ homes, vehicles, or land to cover breach fees. In the case of one respondent, “An employer threatened a worker with immigration consequences if they failed to pay a $15,000 breach fee.” Even if these are not followed through, “the mere threat of enforcing them is sufficient to trap workers.”43

Misleading Information about Return on Investment

Workers reported having been induced to sign on to employer-driven debts because employers had led them to believe they were structuring employer-driven debts to help them achieve career mobility and higher earnings. Yet Request for Information submissions seem to indicate that this often may not be the case, particularly with respect to dubious valuations of the credit obligation and misleading statements made when recruiting potential employees.

Inaccurate Recruitment

Companies may mislead potential workers about the nature, work conditions, or earnings of the prospective jobs for which they are considering incurring debt. As explained by one respondent, “Workers are often driven into debt to their employers on the assumption—and their employers’ assurances—that their investment in equipment or other resources will pay off. In reality, their profits are eaten by the debts initially incurred, or there were no meaningful profits to be had in the first place.”44 Another stated that, “While employers tend to claim that such training, which is often required as a condition of employment, provides valuable transferable skills for workers to excel in their career no matter the employer, and that such TRA[P]s are necessary to allow employers to recoup the costs of training for employees who might otherwise seek to leave sooner than anticipated, a comprehensive study of TRAs concluded that (1) TRAs harm workers, and (2) TRAs are used primarily to restrict worker mobility, not to recoup training costs.45

One respondent explained they felt misled about the pet groomer job for which they had incurred debt, stating, “I constantly heard from my managers while I was a bather that things would be better when I was a groomer. That all the mental and physical strain would be worth it when I was finally making commission. What is not told is how they will force more work on you and make you feel less than if you can’t physically or mentally handle the work.”46 Researchers have also found that some truckers may receive fewer hours, and therefore lower earnings, than they were promised, such as a worker from Argentina who only received 25 hours instead of the 40 hours he was promised after going into debt to pay the $3,000 fee for his visa.47

Dubious Valuation of the Training or Equipment

Many Request for Information respondents stated that during employment recruitment, companies also misled prospective workers about the value of the employer-driven debt to the worker. Firm-specific trainings and orientations often have purportedly substantial valuations:

“TRAPs have required a metal polisher to pay $20,000 to leave a metal furnishing company before three years, truck drivers to pay $8,000 for an early departure, and an information technology trainee on a $23,000 salary to pay $30,000 for leaving a job before two years.”48

But some firm-specific trainings may have greatly inflated valuations, with little to no actual value for the worker despite the high costs charged. In the trucking industry, one company charged truckers over $6,000 to attend its Commercial Driver’s License school if they seek to separate from their employment, but the company only paid the truck driving schools $1,400 - $2,500 per trucker.49 A comment submitted by the TRLA stated, “…some TRLA clients bound by repayment agreements report to us that they never received any training at all. Indeed, some TRLA clients’ training-repayment provisions actually specify that the ‘training’ is simply the on-the-job knowledge that the worker will gain through experience.”50 In the case of truckers who take on debt by using a lease-purchase agreement to obtain a truck, the valuation of the trucks themselves may also be inflated, as one respondent stated, “There were not very many trucks to choose from. Most were broken down and had been leased and returned several times over. They were barely through the detail bay to throw out the previous driver’s stuff before they were available to lease again.”51

In the nursing industry, in which workers have already completed all significant education and certification requirements to practice as a nurse, one Request for Information respondent stated, “I was told that the $10,000 was the cost incurred to train a nurse, however, I had minimal and often unstructured orientation.”52 Another stated, “the trend of requiring new graduate nurses to sign predatory 2-3 year contracts has been increasing and becoming the norm … New grad nurses have not dropped in standard and are getting the same amount (or less depending on staffing) of training as I did 8 years ago. The cost of training hasn’t gone up, it’s just hospitals attempting to be predatory.”53 At a hospital in Dallas, Texas, some new graduate nurses reported that, “outside vendors provided mostly useless training content, or that the training did not include classroom components and seemed no more robust than what would be offered during a routine orientation and preceptorship.”54 Yet these trainings put these nurses between $5,000 - $50,000 in debt if they wished to leave their jobs.55

Risks to Household Financial Well-Being

Workers may face significant financial harms as a result of entering into employer-driven debts. These include harms experienced because of staying in their jobs as well as harms experienced after leaving their jobs.

Lower Earnings

Employers may shift the cost of training onto workers through lower pay for the duration of their contract, a phenomenon first described by University of Chicago economist Gary Becker who stated, “employee pay for general on-the-job training by receiving wages below what they could receive elsewhere.”56 In the nursing industry, anecdotal evidence suggests that hospitals that are unable or unwilling to compete on wages and other benefits more frequently utilize TRAPs to limit worker mobility.57 Companies using employer-driven debt may withhold earnings from workers’ paychecks to cover the debt, such as one food services company which, “may deduct any amount due from any paycheck(s) including but not limited to your final paycheck,”58 and a hospital whose Nurse Residency Agreement has a provision that states the hospital can withhold any amounts owed to the hospital as repayment for the training from an employee’s paycheck, including payment from accrued but unused PTO [paid time off].59

Request for Information responses suggest many workers receive exceptionally meager paychecks because deductions are taken to cover debt payments throughout the course of their work or to cover additional significant employment-related expenses. Truck drivers may take home as little as $0.67 a week and $20,000 a year on accounts that brought in $95,000 to the company as a result of the significant cost of lease-purchase agreements on their trucks as well as out-of-pocket expenses. They may even be fired when they cannot afford to repair their trucks.60 Of 300 drivers interviewed by USA Today, many not only paid for their trucks, but also for insurance, fuel, parking in the company lot, and in one case even for office toilet paper and supplies.61 In the case of workers on guest worker visas, “While employers are required to provide H-2A workers housing at no cost, TRLA clients report that employers often charge them for housing-related expenses, including hiring an exterminator to spray for bugs, completing repairs, or covering utilities…Employers have even charged TRLA clients for work-related equipment, including gloves and hats.”62 As reported by the Franchise Times, immigrant workers in Massachusetts filed a class action lawsuit against a janitorial company that deducted the cost of its $14,000 franchising fee from franchisees’ earnings, of which the plaintiffs’ attorney stated,

“It’s heartbreaking to meet immigrants who have put their entire life savings to these franchises thinking they have businesses to support themselves and their families. Instead, they are buying jobs that are terrible, that pay less than minimum wage. When they do get a check, the franchisor has taken out so many deductions, for royalties, supplies, management fees, and bogus insurance policies, that they receive very little. I’ve seen pay stubs that say the franchisee owes the company money.”63

Impact on Other Household Expenses

Employer-driven debt may also be putting workers’ abilities to meet their overall household expenses at risk as they face lower earnings, damaged credit scores, and additional debts incurred to meet repayment obligations. One Request for Information commenter stated, “After leaving [redacted], Nurse C received a letter from a third-party collections company demanding that they pay $6,000. They paid the $6,000 in full at one time. Paying that debt to [redacted] at the same time as they lost their job was hard on their family. It made it harder to pay bills and made them worry about making rent.”64 Another respondent stated, “I ended up leaving for a different company [redacted] only a couple months after driving solo. That meant that despite having gone through with training and putting on some miles, nothing is prorated (we had to sign a contract) and we owe the full $7k...We had to take out a loan against my husband’s TSP to pay off my [redacted] training because I didn’t want to roll it into another company.”65

Pressure Tactics to Collect on Debts

For workers who decide to leave their jobs, Request for Information submissions suggest that employers may attempt to pressure the former employee into making payments, even when it appears the debt may have been found illegal if challenged in the courts or state law clearly prohibits the debt. In three class action lawsuits against one trucking company, the company was found to have violated state usury laws by charging 18 percent interest rates and to have violated state and federal wage laws. Nonetheless, the company had attempted and succeeded in collecting on some of these debts.66 One respondent stated, “they were sending me demand letters trying to get me to pay it back. Ultimately, they admitted it was unenforceable, but they were attempting to scare me into paying them back.”67 Another commenter stated, “Letters received by TRLA clients often demand that the worker respond to the employer’s attorney within a matter of days, creating a feeling of urgency and fear and discouraging the worker from seeking legal assistance to determine whether their former employers’ demands are legitimate and legal.”68 Yet another stated, “The collection company is called [redacted]and they call once a month to say I owe like over $300,000 on this truck. It isn’t on my credit report or anything. I’m sure they have other drivers out there thinking they have to pay this collection company for a truck that is probably junk and worth less than $50k on one of these so-called ‘walk away lease’ truck programs.”69

When pressured to pay an alleged debt, the presence of a mandatory arbitration agreement or waiver of class arbitration for employment disputes may further cause a worker to be apprehensive about raising a legal challenge even when the debt is ultimately unenforceable.70 In one case, a worker observed that it cost her more than $137,000 to sue the company because of the mandate to go through expensive arbitration. After her successful case, the worker wrote in a press statement, “Yet when [redacted] doesn’t get the ruling in their favor, they file endless appeals hoping franchisees will eventually run out of money and give up on the lawsuit.”71

Erroneous Record Keeping and Improper Dispute Resolution Processes

Employers may not be equipped to handle the servicing of employer-driven debt payments and workers may have little recourse to dispute improper calculations of the debt owed; even when the debts are sent to third-party debt collectors, those firms may be collecting on files that lacked contract and payment tracking and compliance systems when held by the employer.

One commenter reported,

“I had a hard time believing I was that far past due since I had been making the payment and a half for a while, so I asked for an accounting of all the payments I made to them. They initially ignored me until I asked a lawyer to write a letter. The document they produced was an excel spreadsheet that didn’t have payments broken out and many errors. When I compared what I paid to what they had noted there was a huge discrepancy. Then they sent another notice saying I owed even more money, but they could never provide proof.” 72

Another commenter explained that in the case of a nurse who had received a stipend for relocation costs,

“After [Registered Nurse] quit, the hospital pursued his debt in an irregular and unfair fashion. The first successful contact with [Registered Nurse] pertaining to the debt, a letter, claimed the debt was the full amount of the two bonuses minus a credit, but did not explain how the credit was calculated. It gave unclear and conflicting information about how to make contact to resolve the debt. [Registered Nurse], to the best of his ability and in good faith trying to repay the debt, made and executed a payment plan, but the debt collector [redacted] made it difficult for him to make payments and receive confirmation.” 73
Impact on Credit Report and Ability to Find New Employment

Employer-driven debts may have a derogatory effect on workers’ credit reports and, in turn, impede their ability to obtain other financial products that require credit checks, or a new job with a company that requires a credit check as a precondition to employment.74 Some employers refer their former workers to collection agencies if they do not pay back the debt, such as one trucking company that referred unpaid debts to multiple debt collectors and to credit reporting agencies.75

In a study of truck drivers, researchers found that many of the drivers already had subprime credit scores before being referred to a collection agency by their former employer, “making them even more vulnerable to the long-term effects of failing to pay off their debt.”76 One commenter reported the impact employer-driven debt had on a nurse’s ability to find new employment, stating, “Nurse F faced difficult working conditions and left the position without knowing that they would be required to repay the $3,000. The hospital reported the debt to credit reporting agencies and it went on Nurse F’s credit report, which future potential employers raised in job interviews.”77 Another respondent described a worker in the pet grooming industry who, “reportedly learned of her debt to her former employer only when she did a routine check of her credit report. She owed them $5,000 for her training, and an additional $500 for tools she received to do her job. The debt had been referred to collection, and her credit score had dropped from the high 600s to the low 600s as a result.”78

Additionally, if litigation follows the debt, the time spent in court poses challenges to employability. One commenter reported their ability to find new employment has been harmed after leaving their contracts, stating, “These jobs—they’re very hard to come by. And if I quit, I owe the company 40 percent of my salary, plus a percentage of the [redacted] years remaining on my contract, plus any bonuses that they’ve paid to me and any reimbursements that they’ve paid to me. And they’re going to take me to court for it. And in the time that I’m in court, I’m not employable.”79

Conclusion

The apparent rise in employer-driven debts and increasing use of TRAPs may pose substantial risks to consumers, particularly when employers use unequal bargaining power to require workers to become indebted to the employer or an affiliate as a condition of employment. Analysis of employer-driven debt arrangements identified the following areas of concern:

Workers may experience unique harms related to employer-driven debts because employer-driven debts are inextricably linked to a worker’s employment, so the worker’s ability to repay the debt is controlled by the issuer of the debt itself.
Based on workers’ reports, there is a risk that employees may be rushed into signing agreements that hide the details of the debt workers are agreeing to, or that employers may even unilaterally change the terms and conditions after origination without workers’ awareness or understanding.
Commenters report that debts are often imposed as a mandatory pre-condition for employment, suggesting employers may impede workers’ ability to consider and negotiate the terms and conditions of employer-driven debt before accepting the job.
Workers may experience negative impacts on their overall household financial stability as they face lower earnings, damaged credit scores, and additional debts incurred to meet repayment-related obligations.

As indicated in the comments submitted in response to the Request for Information, these issues raise significant concerns regarding the use of TRAPs and the negative impacts of employer-driven debts. The CFPB is committed to working with other federal, state, and local regulators with relevant jurisdiction, as appropriate, to ensure that the workplace is not a source of potential consumer harm. The CFPB will continue to evaluate the use of TRAPs or other employer-driven debts for potential violations of consumer financial laws and is committed to using all its tools to address the risks they may cause for consumers.

By Rohit Chopra – JUN 04, 2014
SHARE & PRINT

Chairman Murray, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the potential impact of student debt on the lives of American consumers and the broader economy.

My name is Rohit Chopra, and I serve as an Assistant Director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), where I lead an office that focuses on issues facing students and young Americans. In 2011, I was also designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as the Student Loan Ombudsman within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new role established by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Over the last decade, policymakers have focused heavily on trying to make college more affordable for students in years to come, which is an important goal. But the financial crisis, which destroyed trillions of dollars in home equity and savings for many families preparing to send a child to college, contributed to substantial increases in the amount of student debt owed by Americans who have since graduated from college. Therefore, it is important to focus on – and act to address – the impact of the $1.2 trillion in student debt already owed by more than 40 million Americans.

Growing Consensus

Two years ago, analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau uncovered that there was more than $1 trillion in outstanding student debt, and we raised the possibility that excessive student debt burdens may pose a problem for all of us. 1 Since that time, there has been growing consensus that today’s $1.2 trillion can have repercussions that threaten the economic security of young Americans and broader economic growth.

Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew remarked that student debt is “hampering our economy” across multiple sectors of society. 2 The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s monetary policy rate-setting board, identified student debt as a risk to aggregate household spending in coming years. 3The Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprised of financial regulators and monitors from across the U.S. government, noted last month that “high student-debt burdens may dampen consumption and could impact household demand for housing purchases.” 4

Senior executives in the banking industry have also cautioned that the condition of the student loan market “is now having a significantly negative impact on students, the economy, and taxpayers.” 5 America’s largest automaker has cited the overhang of student debt as a key factor explaining the relatively low levels of car purchases by young people. 6

Student Debt Domino Effect

Last year, the Bureau issued a public notice and held a hearing to gather input on the student debt domino effect, as well as potential policy options to mitigate the damage. We received more than 28,000 responses from experts and individuals impacted by student debt. 7 The responses from industry and consumers identified several potential areas of concern.

Homeownership and Household Formation

Respondents cited research that showed that three-quarters of the overall shortfall in household formation can be attributed to reductions among younger adults ages 18 to 34, the age group disproportionately impacted by student debt. 8 In 2011, two million more Americans in this age group lived with their parents, compared to 2007. 9

Professionals on the front line of the housing industry – from real estate agents to builders to mortgage bankers – have all described the challenges posed by student debt to homeownership. 10 There appears to be a number of specific effects, including: down payment accumulation, mortgage qualification, and move-up purchases.

According to a recent survey by the National Association of Realtors, 49 percent of Americans cited student loan debt as a “huge obstacle” to homeownership. Realtors have noted that first-time homebuyers typically rely heavily on savings to fund down payments. When young workers are putting large portions of their income toward student loan payments, this can extend the time it takes to accumulate that first down payment.

One borrower, Heather, told us she owes $115,000 in student loans from earning her degrees, half of which are private student loans. She loves her job as a nurse, but she also wrote, “I would also love to buy a new car and buy a home which I won’t be able to do for a very long time.” 11

The chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association noted that student debt will “have an extraordinary dampening effect on young peoples’ ability to borrow for a home, and that’s going to impact the housing market and the economy at large.” The National Association of Home Builders wrote to the Bureau about the relatively low share of first-time homebuyers in the market compared to historical levels and that student debt can “impair the ability of recent college graduates to qualify for a loan.” 12

Another borrower, Michelle, told us that she would be able to pay less per month if she bought a home rather than rented. But she was told her debt relative to her income meant that she could not qualify for a mortgage. 13

With lower levels of first-time buyers in the market, this also poses problems for existing homeowners. William Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said recently that student debt’s impact on first-time homeownership “makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.” 14

And the impact isn’t limited to those who want to buy a home. One realtor told us how she routinely checks credit reports for prospective renters. With student loans soaking up so much of their incomes, many applications end up being denied. With so many young Americans living with parents or roommates rather than forming their own households, this might have a material impact on purchases of other goods, like furniture and appliances.

Small Business and Entrepreneurship

Small business plays a critical role in creating opportunity and wealth in our economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, small businesses, defined as an independent entity having fewer than 500 employees, created two-thirds of net new jobs from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2012. But student debt may be stymying the efforts of entrepreneurs to sustain and grow their businesses.

One aspiring entrepreneur, Julie, wrote, “I am in the process of starting a business, but am unsure as to whether I can afford to because I have so much student loan debt.” 15

In submissions to the Bureau by coalitions of small businesses and startups, groups cited a number of potential negative impacts of student debt on entrepreneurship, such as access to credit and willingness to take financial risks. There has been an increasing amount of evidence to support these hypotheses.

Preliminary research on student debt and small business formation finds a “significant and economically meaningful negative correlation between changes in student loan debt and net business formation” for small businesses employing 1-4 employees. 16 Unlike larger firms with more seamless access to capital markets, small businesses often rely heavily on the owner’s personal access to credit used primarily for business purposes.

Longitudinal surveys of small businesses illustrate the outsized role that personal credit cards and personal bank loans play in financing the enterprise’s growth and survival. In early years, surviving small businesses rapidly increase their employment, while also heavily utilizing these forms of financing. One of the top reasons for denial of credit to small businesses is attributed to the owner’s personal credit profile. 17

In roundtable discussions with entrepreneurs, founders describe that their student debt forces them to take cash out of the business to make their payments, making it tougher to “bootstrap.” Those early revenues could otherwise be reinvested to hire employees or to expand their product offerings. Others have told the Bureau that prospective investors are concerned when founders have heavy student debt burdens, since the entrepreneur may be unable to maintain an extended period of negative cash flow or may be tempted to leave for a higher salary at a larger firm.

Retirement Security and Asset Accumulation

The impact of heavy student debt burdens may also have a longer-term effect on the ability of households to save and accumulate wealth for retirement. One borrower, Kristi, was quite straightforward when telling us about saving for retirement, “Don’t make me laugh! We can’t save for retirement because we need all of our money for these loans.” 18

Tabulations of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances reveals a large lag in net worth for younger households with student debt. Households headed by a younger college-educated adult had a net worth of just $8,700 – approximately 85% less than equivalent households without student debt, despite nearly identical household income between debtors and non-debtors. The difference is even more dramatic for student debtors who did not complete a bachelor’s degree. 19

Student debt can also have more long-term impacts on an individual’s financial security. Due to the shift away from defined benefit plans and toward 401(k)s, IRAs and other defined contribution plans, ensuring a secure retirement will be largely self-directed for most young workers. Young workers who are able to make early, sizable contributions to these plans can generate significant retirement assets over the course of their careers. But student debt may be impeding workers from making sizable contributions – or even contributing at all.

Recent analysis by the largest provider of employer-based defined contribution plans indicates that 43 percent of young workers participate in their employers’ plans, compared to approximately 70 percent of workers ages 35 to 64. For the greater than two-thirds of employers that do not feature automatic enrollment, participation in these plans by young workers drops to just 23 percent. 20

And according to two industry analyses, 43 percent of young workers do not save enough to receive a full employer match 22 and are more likely to cash out their plans when changing jobs. 22

If student debt acts as a headwind to young worker participation in retirement plans, the opportunity for wealth accumulation diminishes significantly. One recent estimate considered the impact of an average level of student loan debt for a college-educated household compared to a similarly situated debt-free household. The analysis found that student debt could crowd out more than $200,000 in net assets over a borrower’s working life, including a loss of nearly $135,000 in net retirement savings. 23

The impact on retirement security is not limited to younger workers – many older households are forced to reevaluate their retirement plans in light of debt used to finance the education of a child or grandchild. AARP wrote to the Bureau about the impact of student debt on families headed by households over the age of 50, noting that “increasing debt threatens their ability to save for retirement or accumulate other assets, and may end up requiring them to delay retirement.” 24

Health Care, Education and Rural America

The impact of student debt might also skew labor market outcomes. Notably, heavy debt burdens exacerbate the challenges that many communities face when seeking to attract and retain health care professionals and teachers. These problems may be felt even more acutely in rural America.

The American Medical Association noted that high debt burdens can impact the career choices of new doctors, leading some to abandon caring for the elderly or children for more lucrative specialties. 25 New research validates these concerns — the share of new medical school graduates pursuing primary care specialties has declined steadily since 2009 and student debt has been found to have been a statistically significant deterrent on the selection of primary care practice by some medical students. 26
The impact of rising student debt on graduates’ ability to practice in primary care is not limited to physicians. Tara, a nurse working in primary care at a community health clinic told us she “could not in good conscience recommend primary care as a career choice for others” due to her student debt burden. 27

Many graduates pursuing careers in many public service professions share the same concerns. One borrower told us how she was unable to find a repayment plan that made her debt manageable and ultimately chose to abandon her career as a teacher in order to pursue more lucrative work in the private sector. 28 Recent research has shown that for every $10,000 in additional student debt, young graduates are 6% less likely to pursue a career in public service, especially careers as teachers. 29

Classroom teachers submitted letters detailing the impact of private student loan debt, for which forgiveness programs or income-based repayment options are usually not offered. One school district official wrote to the Bureau noting that programs to make student debt more manageable could lead to higher retention of quality teachers. 30

These trends may pose additional challenges to rural communities, where young graduates with already-strained household balance sheets may have limited access to affordable rental housing and may discover that car ownership is a prerequisite for employment. With many rural medical professionals operating in solo practices, high debt levels might reduce availability to secure initial financing.

Student debt can also impact the availability of other professions critical to the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers in rural communities. According to an annual survey conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association, 89 percent of veterinary students are graduating with debt, averaging $151,672 per borrower. 31 Veterinarians encumbered with high debt burdens may be unable to make ends meet in a dairy medicine or livestock management practice in remote areas.

Accountability for Student Loan Servicers

Loan servicers are the primary point of contact on student loans for more than 40 million Americans. High-quality servicing can contribute to an individual borrower’s ability to successfully repay their debt, especially through enrollment into affordable repayment plans.

As the recession decimated the job market for young graduates, a growing share of student loan borrowers reached out to their servicers for help. But the problems they have encountered bear an uncanny resemblance to the problems faced by struggling homeowners when dealing with their mortgage servicers. Like many of the improper and unnecessary foreclosures experienced by many homeowners, I am concerned that inadequate servicing has contributed to America’s growing student loan default problem, now topping 7 million Americans in default on over $100 billion in balances.

The Bureau has received thousands of complaints from borrowers describing the difficulties they face with their student loan servicers. Borrowers have told the Bureau about a range of problems, from payment processing errors to servicing transfer surprises to loan modification challenges. To ensure that we do not see a repeat of the breakdowns and chaos in the mortgage servicing market, it will be critical to ensure that student loan servicers are providing adequate customer service and following the law.

Canary in the Coal Mine

In the mortgage market, a particularly disconcerting occurrence involved the foreclosures faced by active-duty servicemembers, despite prohibitions under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). Like in the mortgage market, the treatment of servicemembers by student loan servicers has been quite troubling. Rather than receiving clear and accurate information, many military families have found themselves buried in and blindfolded by red tape from their student loan servicers.

My colleague Holly Petraeus, who leads the Bureau’s Office of Servicemember Affairs, and I also published a report describing the obstacles military families face when attempting to access their student loan repayment benefits provided by applicable laws. 32 For example, men and women in uniform are entitled to a 6 percent rate cap on their student loans incurred prior to entering active-duty status, as provided for by the SCRA. Unfortunately, some servicers have placed inappropriate requirements on servicemembers seeking the rate cap.

For example, one servicemember who filed a complaint with the Bureau saw his request to his servicer rejected multiple times because his military orders did not include an end date. This is neither a requirement of the SCRA, nor feasible for many military commissioned officers to obtain, as their orders usually do not delineate an end date. Another servicemember with multiple loans sought to reduce the rate on his highest-rate loans, but, simultaneously, the servicer proceeded to raise the rate on the loans that were below 6 percent.

Improper and potentially unlawful servicing errors can cause harm to servicemembers. Admittedly, military families are a small segment of the population. But if a servicer is unable to provide adequate service to those who have special protections under the law, it raises questions about whether it is agile enough to deal with the complexities of the larger population of borrowers facing hardship.

Strengthening Student Loan Servicing

Unlike most markets for consumer products and services, student loan borrowers generally don’t get to choose their student loan servicer. And with few opportunities to refinance with a new provider, a consumer cannot easily take his or her business elsewhere. Ordinary market forces won’t guarantee reasonable customer service, while potentially magnifying incentives to cut corners.

The past decade offers a useful case study about the potential impact of conflicting incentives. In 2004, the Department of the Treasury finalized the privatization of the Student Loan Marketing Association, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) better known as Sallie Mae. This year, SLM Corp., the GSE’s successor company, ceased operating in its current form. 33

During the ten years the successor corporation operated, it generated substantial revenue through government contracts for student loan servicing and debt collection. The company also benefitted from several government-supported emergency programs as problems in the capital markets emerged. 34 Despite these benefits received from the public, the corporation was found to be violating the law on multiple occasions by state authorities, 35 banking regulators, 36 and federal auditors. 37

And just last month, after referrals from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and the FDIC ordered Sallie Mae and Navient to pay nearly $100 million in restitution and penalties for violating multiple laws. Regulators determined 38 that the companies were:

Unfairly conditioning receipt of benefits under the SCRA upon requirements not found in the law
Improperly advising servicemembers that they must be deployed to receive benefits under the SCRA
Failing to provide complete SCRA relief to servicemembers after having been put on notice of these borrowers’ active duty status
Inadequately disclosing its payment allocation methodologies to borrowers while allocating borrowers’ payments across multiple loans in a manner that maximizes late fees
Misrepresenting and inadequately disclosing in its billing statements how borrowers could avoid late fees
The FDIC also noted in the consent order that there were violations of additional consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. 39

While the post-GSE corporation no longer operates in the form it took immediately post-privatization, the challenges it experienced offer a reminder that regulators must be vigilant to protect consumers, since ordinary market forces in the student loan market may not fully align incentives among all market participants.

The Bureau recently finalized a rule that will allow the agency to supervise larger nonbank student loan servicers, closing a significant gap in oversight for compliance with federal consumer financial laws.

In a recent report analyzing student loan complaints related to payment processing and servicing transfers, I recommended that Congress consider the applicability of recent reforms to the credit card and mortgage servicing markets to determine whether they might help the student loan servicing market function more efficiently. 40

For example, many consumers who wish to pay down their loans more quickly find that student loan servicers allocate payments in ways that might increase the amount of total interest they will pay, slowing them down on the path to be debt-free. For credit card borrowers with balances at multiple rates, generally, prepayments are allocated to balances at the highest interest rate, facilitating faster repayment of debt with minimal bureaucratic burden.

Refinance and Restructure

For borrowers who graduated into a difficult labor market, high student debt burdens have added insult to injury. Borrowers and industry observers have repeatedly noted that, unlike other markets, refinance opportunities are few and far between. In a report published last May, we discussed ways to jumpstart a student loan refinance market and spur loan restructuring. 41

Among borrowers who have dutifully managed their monthly payments on high-interest student loans, many told us that they would like an opportunity to refinance. When mortgage borrowers see rates plummet, their incomes rise, or their credit profiles improve, they try to refinance. Responsible student loan borrowers rarely have these options. Fortunately, since our May 2013 report, we have seen some market participants expand their offerings to borrowers, offering them lower rates that can lead to substantial savings over the life of the loan. 42

While the vast majority of outstanding student loan debt is guaranteed or directly lent by the federal government, solutions to promote affordability of student loans must consider the role of private student loans. High-debt borrowers graduating amidst the financial crisis disproportionately used private student loans. According to an analysis of borrowers graduating from a four-year college in 2008 with more than $40,000 in debt, 81% used private student loans. 43

Unlike federal student loans, which include a range of loan modification options to keep payments affordable, private student loan borrowers rarely have these options. The report describes ways to create a uniform framework for borrowers to restructure their private student loans so loan restructuring activity can be dramatically increased, while simultaneously reducing borrower distress.

BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, noted that “initiatives targeted at young workers with high levels of student indebtedness, perhaps surprisingly to some, have an outsize impact in supporting the housing recovery and financial markets.” 44 More robust refinancing and loan restructuring that reduces the burden of student debt can benefit borrowers, market participants, and the economy more broadly.

Demystify with Data and Transparency

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen once noted that, prior to the crisis, financial regulators “missed some of the important linkages whereby problems in mortgages would rebound through the financial system.” 45 The opacity and our collective lack of understanding of the mortgage market had serious consequences for the economy.

While there have been major strides to better assemble mortgage data, the opacity of the student loan market remains deeply problematic, adding further uncertainty over the potential spillovers into the rest of the economy. I am quite concerned that financial regulators and the public lack access to basic, fundamental data on student loan origination and performance. Without these data, we will be challenged to understand the complete set of risks posed by student debt burdens.

Most loan-level mortgage origination data is currently subject to public disclosure, stripped of borrower-identifiable information, under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 46 Data from housing GSEs and mortgage-backed securities filings shed significant light on loan-level performance. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regularly publishes a mortgage metrics report, detailing loan modification performance and other key servicing data. 47

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council collects reports from insured depository institutions on balance sheet holdings, but student loans are aggregated with many other types of non-mortgage credit products. SEC filings from large financial institutions rarely report key data on student loans. Student loan ABS filings and servicer performance reports are much less granular than similar mortgage reports. Unsurprisingly, the drivers of prepayment, delinquency, and default in the student loan market are not well understood by investors and financial analysts. Questionable accuracy of student loan credit reporting data adds further uncertainty.

We must also seek to better understand how student debt is distributed among various segments of the population. The American Association of University Women, citing its 2012 analysis of borrower debt burden, noted that a much higher portion of female college graduates are shouldering heavy debt burdens relative to their income, compared to similarly-situated males. 48

According to the College Board, 49 black students graduating from college in 2008 at the onset of the financial crisis were more likely to have higher levels of debt than other students. Black students were more likely to use private student loans. 50 In addition, an analysis of the Current Population Survey from the Center for Economic and Policy Research reveals that unemployment for black recent college graduates was more than double that of the entire population of recent college graduates in 2013. Even black recent college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields experienced higher than average unemployment. Differences in underemployment rates also showed similar trends. 51 Understanding both loan usage and employment patterns can help determine borrower populations where distress may be more acute.

The Bureau is coordinating with other regulators on potential ways to enhance the quality of publicly-reported data. Over the longer term, we must aim to reduce the transparency gap between the mortgage and student loan markets. This can lead to more efficient market monitoring and shed light on the linkages between student indebtedness and other sectors of the economy. Better data and transparency will help us to better understand the demographics and professions where borrowers may be experiencing distress, as well as whether lenders and servicers are fairly serving their customers.

Preserving the Dream

Our country was built on the promise that if each of us played our part, contributed our labor, our enterprise and our knowledge, the only limit to our success was our own work ethic. College has served as a gateway to opportunity for millions to climb the ladder and achieve their dreams. And the individual rewards of our hard work – owning a car, buying our first home, and securing a comfortable retirement – continue to define the American dream.

But in the aftermath of the Great Recession, behind all of the facts and statistics, is a much broader question – how do we preserve the drive to succeed for so many who feel that the dream is now out of reach?

For borrowers like Andrea, student debt is a direct threat. She writes, “How can someone even dream of taking out a mortgage to purchase a home when she is struggling to pay back student debt? How can a person think of starting a family if he already owes so much money? How can a potential entrepreneur take the risk to start her dream business when she knows that failure will not only mean losing that investment, but everything else as well? We go to college to open doors, to pursue what we truly want out of a fulfilling life. Massive student debt debilitates this mission.” 52

Ignoring the warning signs may prove to hold back not only the future growth and dynamism of our economy, but also our spirits. Addressing these concerns in the near-term may pay dividends for many years to follow.

Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s hearing, and I look forward to discussing potential solutions to help borrowers climb the economic ladder and stop the student debt domino effect.

Thank you for the honor of being chosen as this year’s Distinguished Lecturer on Regulation. I am especially happy to be back at the University of Pennsylvania, even if just virtually. I want to thank Professor Coglianese and the Penn Program on Regulation for organizing today’s event.

Not only did I grow up nearby, I was also fortunate to attend business school here at Penn. Today, my classmates, students, and other alumni are now financiers, convicted felons, and everything in between.

While here – and I was hardly alone on this point – I viewed financial regulators as clueless and often corrupt lawyers and economists. Government officials were often seen as auditioning for a future job in finance to exploit their inside knowledge to help dominant financial firms extract special favors and evade accountability for wrongdoing, even when they violate the law repeatedly.

This brings me to today’s topic: reining in repeat offenders. As always, my remarks today reflect the views of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and do not necessarily represent the views of any other part of the Federal Reserve System.

***

I want to address a vexing problem facing regulators across sectors of the economy: How do we stop large dominant firms from violating the law over and over again with seeming impunity? Corporate recidivism has become normalized and calculated as the cost of doing business; the result is a rinse-repeat cycle that dilutes legal standards and undermines the promise of the financial sector and the entire market system.

Agency and court orders are not suggestions, but many large companies see them as such. While small firms can get hit hard with penalties that threaten their viability and their operators fear imprisonment, many large institutions see the law as mere expenses on their income statements.

The special treatment applied to large financial institutions over their smaller counterparts, as well as the “too big to fail” and “too big to jail” problems, undermines the public’s confidence in the rule of law, a bedrock principle of our society. Honest players and new entrants are disadvantaged, and the whole system is corroded.

Repeat offenders take many forms. The worst type of repeat offender violates a formal court or agency order; this is especially egregious because they often consented to the terms as part of a settlement. They clearly understand the laws and provisions to adhere to but failed to comply due to dysfunction or they took a calculated risk. Another type of repeat offender is one that has multiple violations of law across different business lines, but the violations stem from a common cause. For example, I have found that violations across business lines often relate to problematic sales practice incentives or a failure to properly integrate IT systems after a large merger. In other words, the company may have dealt with some symptoms but didn’t do anything about the disease.

We must forcefully address repeat lawbreakers to alter company behavior and ensure companies realize it is cheaper, and better for their bottom line, to obey the law than to break it.

First, I want to spend my time today talking about some specific examples of big firms that have repeatedly broken the law. Second, I want to explore a case study of the Federal Trade Commission’s handling of Facebook’s repeated violations of law. And finally, I want to describe some of the steps the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators can take to halt recidivism and create a system that treats small and big firms equally.

***

There are many examples of large firms that have repeatedly broken the law but faced few meaningful consequences. This is, of course, true in the financial sector.

For those who do not know, the CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to focus on protecting consumers in the financial marketplace. Even in our relatively short existence, we have seen what other regulators have been seeing for decades: large financial institutions crossing legal fault lines over and over again. Specifically, we have taken action against:

Citigroup – 5 times;
JPMorgan Chase – 4 times;
Wells Fargo – 4 times;
American Express – 3 times; and
Discover – 3 times, one of which was a repeat violation of a previous 2015 CFPB order.

There are many more examples, but you get the point. Repeat offenses – whether it’s for the exact same offense or more malfeasance in different business lines – is par for the course for many dominant firms, including big banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and more.

The numbers are also quite large. The CFPB ordered Citibank to pay more than $1 billion in consumer redress. We ordered JPMorgan Chase to pay more than $300 million. All told, in the decade since Congress stripped the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Trade Commission, and other agencies of their authorities and transferred them to the new consumer regulator, the CFPB has already required large corporate recidivists to provide more than $3 billion in consumer redress.

Of course, small players also violate the law. But when they do, they often face punishing sanctions that fundamentally question whether they can remain viable. Dominant firms seem to know that law enforcement will not have that kind of impact on their viability, which allows them to take bigger risks that come with bigger rewards.

After the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, scores of individual bankers were convicted by the Department of Justice. Many were sent to prison. But almost no single senior executive went to jail or was truly held financially accountable for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, even as so many Americans paid a serious price when they lost their homes because they were underwater with toxic mortgages.

Some would argue that these large financial institutions have simply become too big to supervise and that is part of the problem. Government supervisors can’t keep up with the convoluted, behemoth financial products. And government lawyers are never adequately staffed to go up against corporate lawyers trained to spin wheels and run out clocks. Some litigate for years with the hope of the regulator giving up or a new, more forgiving administration coming in. The smaller companies become the low-hanging fruit with cases that are easier to quantify, qualify, and take to court. Whatever the reasons, regulators are willing to lay down the hammer on little guys but settle for press headlines with the big guys.

Often, our laws provide immediate disqualifications from certain privileges for companies found to be engaged in wrongdoing. This is particularly true when it comes to violations of criminal statutes. For example, under federal securities law, an issuer cannot enjoy the privileges of being designated as a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer if they have committed certain felonies, misdemeanors, or violated various anti-fraud laws. This designation gives the largest companies a true competitive advantage over smaller companies in tapping our capital markets. However, the SEC has routinely waived this disqualification. For example, from 2006 to 2015 the SEC granted 23 such waivers to Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, JPMorgan Chase, and Royal Bank of Scotland alone. Meaningful penalties become a paper tiger when regulators are not willing to enforce them, entrenching incentives for large companies to engage in repeated misconduct.

Similarly, violating Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreements, which are deals made between the DOJ and companies to postpone prosecution on the conditions of better behaviors, have become quite common with corporate defendants. For example, JPMorgan Chase has a long history of multiple, overlapping deals with the DOJ. In 2020, the DOJ offered JPMorgan a deferred prosecution agreement for its eight years of “separate schemes” relating to trading, despite the fact that, as the DOJ acknowledged in the same press release, the company had already pled guilty to “similar misconduct involving manipulative and deceptive trading practices.”

There has been a lot of noise by government officials that big financial institutions are not “too big to jail,” but the way government has been treating them suggests otherwise. This simply raises the stakes in what we do, as government regulators, when wrongdoers are caught.

***

I now want to discuss one of the best examples of failed repeat offender enforcement: the Federal Trade Commission’s treatment of one of the largest and most well-known corporations in the world: Facebook. Facebook is a clear example of a politically powerful firm that routinely violated the terms of its government order with no real consequences.

I raise Facebook not only because it is such an egregious case but also because of the potential of very large firms entering financial services. It’s clear that Big Tech wants to get into the market, as we saw with Facebook’s failed attempt to create a new global currency. We’ve also seen Alibaba, Amazon, Google, and Tencent entering financial services, including with payments, money management, insurance, and lending. Given their size and customer reach, their entry has the potential to transform the industry. How these companies engage in other business practices is how we can expect them to engage in financial services, so it is worth going into some detail about the FTC case against one of the biggest players in this space.

In 2011, the FTC voted to issue an eight-count complaint against Facebook. According to the FTC, Facebook “deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.” The FTC simultaneously settled the matter for no money but required that Facebook cease its deceptive conduct and implement a program to ensure that privacy promises were kept. The settlement also gave the Commission broad access to company documents and personnel to ensure the company would not break the law again.

I arrived at the FTC as a Commissioner in May of 2018. The agency was in deep decay and disarray after years of lax enforcement against large corporate actors, spanning multiple administrations. In some of the most widespread recent nationwide crises, from the 2008 financial disaster to the opioid epidemic to the student loan and for-profit college scandals, the FTC was essentially missing. On a bipartisan basis, the Commission heavily relied on a “no-money, no-fault” settlement strategy, where wrongdoers essentially faced no consequences, even in cases of egregious fraud.

In the case of Facebook, though, the company was already subject to an FTC order, and violations of an order were subject to significant consequences under existing law. But for many observers, the FTC simply seemed to be watching from the sidelines as its orders were being openly flouted.

A few months prior to my arrival at the Commission, it came to light that Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, to harvest information from more than 50 million individuals and use it for political purposes. This was just one of many controversies where Facebook broke its promises to employ reasonable safeguards to keep personal information private unless the user gave explicit affirmative consent.

As a matter of credibility for the U.S. government, I thought it was essential for the FTC to enforce its own order. For years and years, though, Commissioners set up agency staff to fail. Commissioners deployed armies to small-scale scams, while depriving staff of the needed resources to police Facebook and other Big Tech firms. It was clear that these firms did not think the FTC was serious at all.

By the summer of 2019, we prepared a six-count, 50-page complaint that detailed a long list of privacy failures, including substantial order violations. That was clearly just scratching the surface of the company’s problems. But rather than investigating the matter fully or demanding significant changes to Facebook’s data harvesting practices, Commissioners pursued what many believed to be a publicity stunt.

I admit that the negotiated settlement accepted by a majority of the Commission made for a great headline. But the fine print in the settlement gave a lot for Facebook to celebrate. Facebook would pay a $5 billion fine but did not have to make any material changes to its business practices. Shockingly, Facebook was able to secure a highly unusual immunity clause for its executives, including for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg was also able to retain absolute control over the corporation; though the settlement required a so-called independent committee on privacy whose members would need to be approved by a shareholder vote; and we know Zuckerberg essentially controls a supermajority of voting rights.

Three of the commissioners held a press conference, complete with custom-made graphics, about the “record-setting” nature of the settlement. In fairness, $5 billion does sound very significant. But Facebook had become one of the most valuable corporations in the world, approaching a trillion-dollar valuation. During the press conference, a senior career official largely admitted that Commissioners agreed to forego seeking testimony and documents from Zuckerberg in exchange for a higher fine. It was clear to many that the company paid off the FTC to minimize scrutiny of its top executives’ role in the order violations.

News of the settlement quickly set off alarm bells among data protection regulators around the world. A global consensus emerged that the settlement was a sham.

In my voting statement opposing the settlement, I described how Facebook flagrantly violated the FTC’s 2012 order and how the proposed settlement did little to change the business model or practices that led to the recidivism. The settlement imposed no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to the violations. Nor did it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allowed Facebook to decide for itself how much information it could harvest from users and what it could do with that information, as long as it created a paper trail.

The proposed settlement let Facebook off the hook for unspecified violations and it gave Facebook a legal shield of unusual breadth, deviating from standard FTC practice. Indeed, when the settlement was announced against Facebook, its stock popped.

In my view, there were many lessons from the FTC’s Facebook saga:

For very large firms, seemingly large fines, even ones that are “record-setting,” may appear to be very punitive, but may have little effect;
Corporate boards will go to great lengths to shield top executives from scrutiny, even though they are all bound by agency orders; and
Committees, paperwork, compliance units, and other procedural requirements have much higher monitoring costs than bright-line structural remedies that meaningfully change business incentives.

We need to learn from these lessons to think about not only how to halt recidivism, but also how to treat small and big firms equally when it comes to enforcement actions.

***

Finally, I’ll close with how regulators should be sharpening their focus on repeat offenders and discuss some of the non-monetary, structural remedies agencies might seek in order to levy the same kind of deterrents on small and big firms alike.

Achieving general deterrence is an important goal for the CFPB. We need penalties where the expected financial benefits of an illegal scheme do not outweigh the expected costs. And we need an understanding that agency and court orders are not suggestions. Put plainly, regulators charged with overseeing large institutions have lost credibility when it comes to halting repeat offenders. While headline-driven penalties give the guise of deterrence, they do not work for dominant, powerful firms.

In the end, we need to look at bright-line structural remedies, rather than press-driven approaches. As any gardener knows, to address a weed, you need to get at the root, rather than constantly monitoring what is simply seen on the surface.

Indeed, when the CFPB helped to uncover the “fake accounts” scandal at Wells Fargo, it was not necessarily the $100 million fine on the bank that was material. Instead, it was the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to impose a growth cap that got the institution’s attention. And when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency took a role in vetting appointments of new executive hires, that also got their attention. Rather than relying solely on penalties and procedural paperwork, it is critical that regulators and enforcers shift their mindset in this way when it comes to remedies.

At the CFPB, we have plans to establish dedicated units in our supervision and enforcement divisions to enhance the detection of repeat offenses and corporate recidivists and to better hold them accountable. This will include closer scrutiny to ensure orders are being followed and closer coordination with partner agencies to ensure that each agency’s orders are not treated as suggestions. It is critical that we – regulators, enforcers, and supervisors – support each other in effectuating deterrence and compliance with orders.

But more importantly, for serial offenders of federal law, the CFPB will be looking at remedies that are more structural in nature, with lower enforcement and monitoring costs. Under our authorizing statute, the CFPB may seek “limits on the activities or functions” of a firm for violations of laws, regulations, and orders.

These are reforms that are needed throughout government. Depending on the specific facts, government enforcement agencies have an arsenal of options to truly stop the repeated illegal practices at big financial institutions. Let me run through some of the most important options. While many government regulators have sought such limitations on small businesses, they have shown less willingness to do so with larger and more powerful firms. This needs to change.

First: Caps on size or growth. When you impose asset caps, limitations on transferring or acquiring assets, or related limitations that impact the entity overall, you are curbing incentives to break the law and boosting incentives for compliance.

Second: Bans on certain types of business practices. When you put limits on business or product lines, or you close business lines or specific practices, it stops the immediate harm and stops the company from violating the law again in the future. For example, after LendUp violated a 2016 CFPB order to stop misleading customers about the benefits of its loans, we took action. We stopped LendUp from making new loans, collecting on outstanding loans to harmed customers, and selling customer information. LendUp, a former darling of venture capital, is now shutting down.

Third: Divestitures of certain product lines. Sometimes it is not a toxic product but the business model around that product or the management of the product that is the problem, in which case it makes sense to spin it off so it can operate legally. When order violations stem from a firm’s lack of managerial acumen, this is especially relevant to ensure that all subsidiaries and affiliates are obeying the law.

Fourth: Limitations on leverage or requirements to raise equity capital. When you put guardrails on how the company is fundamentally funded, it mitigates chances that a company will become over-leveraged and engage in the type of dangerous “gambling for resurrection” behavior that can harm customers and our economy. Putting these limitations on the table also serves as a powerful deterrent given financial companies’ desire to maximize their risky debt-funding and short-term return-on-equity.

Fifth: Revocation of government-granted privileges. Large firms are often required to meet certain conditions to maintain privileges authorized by the public through administrative agencies. For example, pharmaceutical companies rely on patents and sell products to government payors. Misconduct can lead to losing these benefits. Meat and poultry firms must often register with government authorities and can lose their registration if engaged in certain wrongdoing.

For repeat offenders that are insured depository institutions, they can lose access to federal deposit insurance or their ability to continue operating. For example, regulators should assess whether it is appropriate to terminate or limit access to FDIC deposit insurance or to put banks directly into receivership. Congress specified that institutions that are unsafe and unsound may be subject to losing access to FDIC deposit insurance or their ability to stay in business. Repeat offenses and, in particular, order violations, may be a sign that an institution’s condition or behavior is unsafe and unsound.

For licensed nonbank institutions, the CFPB will be deepening its collaboration with state licensing officials, so that states can ascertain whether licenses should be suspended or whether corporate assets should be liquidated. If senior management is unable to remedy deep-seated failures, it may be appropriate to liquidate, disband, or otherwise shut down the institution to prevent further harms or legal violations. Indeed, since our nation’s founding, regulators in the U.S. have a history of terminating corporate charters and licenses. Today, this should be considered for institutions of all sizes when the facts and circumstances warrant it.

Finally, the role of individual liability cannot be discounted. When small businesses get in trouble, regulators and enforcers are quick to target the top brass. It is inappropriate and unfair to not have the same approach to big financial institutions when the facts and circumstances of the role of individuals is the same.

Agency and court orders bind officers and directors of the corporation, and so do the laws themselves, so there are multiple ways in which individuals are held accountable. Where individuals play a role in repeat offenses and order violations, it may be appropriate for regulatory agencies and law enforcers to charge these individuals and disqualify them. Dismissal of senior management and board directors, and lifetime occupational bans should also be more frequently deployed in enforcement actions involving large firms.

When it comes to individuals, we also need to pay close attention to executive compensation incentives. Important remedies for restoring law and order may include clawbacks, forfeitures, and other changes to executive compensation, including where we tie up compensation for longer periods of time and use that deferred compensation as the first pot of money to pay fines.

Such actions are more likely to halt recidivism than fines paid from the profits of wrongdoing.

***

In the end, large dominant firms should be subject to the same consequences of enforcement actions as small firms. We need to end double-standard enforcement that exists. We need to move away from just monetary penalties and consider an arsenal of options that really work to stop repeat offenses.

More importantly, when the public perceives that powerful actors in the economy and society live by a different set of rules, this deeply undermines the promise of the rule of law and our market system. We can and must change course on this. Thank you.

Last summer, we learned that U.S. teenagers are in the middle of the pack  when it comes to financial literacy, compared to other nations. Preparing young people for a solid financial future is an important job. And much work remains.

Some recent research looks at how young people build financial skills, habits, and attitudes. The research also emphasizes how parents can model and teach helpful financial habits to their children at an early age.

If you have kids, it might surprise you to know that children as young as five years old can be ready to learn about saving and spending. From early childhood to young adulthood, you can build the foundation to enable them to manage their finances as adults .

Here are some key takeaways from researchers that you can put into practice:

Children as young as five can learn about saving

Research suggests that children are “developmentally capable” of saving by age five. A piggy bank or savings account gives them a hands-on way to build a savings mindset. And parents take note: your child may acquire a taste for financial planning that lasts well into adulthood. The same research shows that children who grew up with a savings account were more likely to hold “diverse asset portfolios and to accumulate more savings as young adults.” That’s a powerful piggy bank!

An allowance isn’t just about money, it’s about guiding your child

Access to money from gifts or from a steady allowance, by itself, may not help your child build habits he or she will need as an adult. Research observed that giving an allowance on its own was an ineffective way to build a child’s financial skills—the benefits came when the child also got guidance on saving and budgeting along with the allowance. According to the research, “parental oversight as to how the money is spent, and parental teaching about budgeting and the necessity of saving, was found to be most effective.” So when you provide opportunities for saving and spending, talk to your children about their decisions.

Young people learn from hands-on experiences

Teenagers can practice financial skills and decision-making. As they manage their first paychecks, and the spending and saving choices that go along with them, parents are still a sounding board. Listening and providing guidance to your teenager can provide a safety net, so that he or she can learn from experiences and mistakes (let’s be honest, there are bound to be a few).

Young adults learn financial skills more and benefit when they have opportunities to make their own financial decisions, while still receiving guidance and feedback. For example, a program that included connecting economically disadvantaged youth to a job and savings account, and providing just-in-time financial education, showed promising results. Youth experienced “both an increase in knowledge and an increase in the application of that knowledge.”

For more ideas on teaching your kids about money, check out our resources for parents.

We are also working to help schools or communities provide youth with more access to hands-on learning around financial education. If this interests you, feel free to share our K-12 financial education guide with your local school. Financial educators can also check out the resources available as they serve the community.

This week, the Office of Servicemember Affairs held a special event: a Financial Fitness Forum. We invited representatives from the military, government agencies, and financial institutions to come and talk about the financial challenges faced by servicemembers and their families, and what is being done – and could be done – to address them. Our particular focus for this event was on the products and services offered to the military by financial institutions.

Hosting this Forum ties directly into our mission to educate and empower servicemembers and their families to make better-informed decisions regarding consumer financial products and services. If we are going to complete that mission, it helps to know what those financial products and services are! There are a number of financial institutions that have been offering unique products for their military customers for quite some time, and we were interested in learning about those. There are other financial institutions that have rolled out special military programs in the past year, in some cases in response to revelations about problems in their compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and we were interested in hearing about those, too.

Our starting point for this event was to ask the financial services industry for input on what they were doing for their military customers. We put a notice in the Federal Register back in September asking for input on military-centric consumer financial products as well as related financial education programs, short-term lending products, mortgage assistance and communications strategies. 43 credit unions weighed in, as well as 8 banks and 2 non-bank financial institutions. We also heard from other organizations and individuals with an interest in the topic, to include consumer advocates and Judge Advocate Generals.

Based on that response, as well as what we’ve heard and observed on our visits to military bases across the United States, we set up five panels. The first one, fittingly, represented our customer base and consisted of senior enlisted members from each branch of military service: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as a representative from the National Guard Bureau. They provided invaluable insights into the mindset of today’s military, as well as how to best reach young servicemembers and their families.

Other panels consisted of senior representatives from banking and credit union trade associations, as well as some representatives from individual financial institutions that serve a large military customer base and have provided special products for them. We heard some innovative ideas, as well as a discussion of some of the challenges banks and credit unions face when trying to give the best possible support to their military customers.

Given the impact of the housing downturn on military families, many of whom are underwater on their mortgages and, as a result, face severe financial difficulties when they receive military Permanent Change of Station orders, we also had a panel to take a look at ways to make it easier for servicemembers to access mortgage help, given their unique circumstances and the fact that a military move can tip them into a genuine hardship. That panel had representatives from Treasury, FHFA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Financial Services Roundtable. They cited some recent steps they have taken to make it easier for military personnel to access foreclosure prevention programs, and asked for help from the Department of Defense in identifying military customers so they can direct information to them.

It was our hope that the Forum would be helpful not only to inform servicemembers about special military products in the financial industry, but also to inform the financial institutions in attendance about the unique needs of the military community, and to inspire them to find new ways to serve that community. I think we heard some creative ideas about what can be done to support the military while still fulfilling a fiduciary duty to investors and staying in the black. And we’d like to thank everyone who attended for sharing their expertise and showing their support of our military personnel and their families, who serve and sacrifice on behalf of all of us.

At a Financial Fitness Forum, Holly Petraeus moderated a panel of military Senior Enlisted Leaders who provided insight linking financial fitness to mission readiness.

It’s always a good time to give your student debt repayment plan a check-up. Regardless of your situation, there are some basic steps you can take to avoid stress and save money in the long run.

Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

Questions to ask your servicer about rehabilitation and consolidation
Questions to ask your servicer about pausing student loan payments
You have other options for help
If you have a problem with a student loan, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPB about federal or private student loans.
You can file a complaint with Federal Student Aid  about federal loans. These complaints can be escalated to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group  .
Contact your state attorney general to file a complaint . Your state may also have a student loan ombudsman. Search the name of your state with “student loan ombudsman.”

Chairman Murray, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the potential impact of student debt on the lives of American consumers and the broader economy.

My name is Rohit Chopra, and I serve as an Assistant Director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), where I lead an office that focuses on issues facing students and young Americans. In 2011, I was also designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as the Student Loan Ombudsman within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new role established by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Over the last decade, policymakers have focused heavily on trying to make college more affordable for students in years to come, which is an important goal. But the financial crisis, which destroyed trillions of dollars in home equity and savings for many families preparing to send a child to college, contributed to substantial increases in the amount of student debt owed by Americans who have since graduated from college. Therefore, it is important to focus on – and act to address – the impact of the $1.2 trillion in student debt already owed by more than 40 million Americans.

Growing Consensus

Two years ago, analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau uncovered that there was more than $1 trillion in outstanding student debt, and we raised the possibility that excessive student debt burdens may pose a problem for all of us. 1 Since that time, there has been growing consensus that today’s $1.2 trillion can have repercussions that threaten the economic security of young Americans and broader economic growth.

Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew remarked that student debt is “hampering our economy” across multiple sectors of society. 2 The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s monetary policy rate-setting board, identified student debt as a risk to aggregate household spending in coming years. 3The Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprised of financial regulators and monitors from across the U.S. government, noted last month that “high student-debt burdens may dampen consumption and could impact household demand for housing purchases.” 4

Senior executives in the banking industry have also cautioned that the condition of the student loan market “is now having a significantly negative impact on students, the economy, and taxpayers.” 5 America’s largest automaker has cited the overhang of student debt as a key factor explaining the relatively low levels of car purchases by young people. 6

Student Debt Domino Effect

Last year, the Bureau issued a public notice and held a hearing to gather input on the student debt domino effect, as well as potential policy options to mitigate the damage. We received more than 28,000 responses from experts and individuals impacted by student debt. 7 The responses from industry and consumers identified several potential areas of concern.

Homeownership and Household Formation

Respondents cited research that showed that three-quarters of the overall shortfall in household formation can be attributed to reductions among younger adults ages 18 to 34, the age group disproportionately impacted by student debt. 8 In 2011, two million more Americans in this age group lived with their parents, compared to 2007. 9

Professionals on the front line of the housing industry – from real estate agents to builders to mortgage bankers – have all described the challenges posed by student debt to homeownership. 10 There appears to be a number of specific effects, including: down payment accumulation, mortgage qualification, and move-up purchases.

According to a recent survey by the National Association of Realtors, 49 percent of Americans cited student loan debt as a “huge obstacle” to homeownership. Realtors have noted that first-time homebuyers typically rely heavily on savings to fund down payments. When young workers are putting large portions of their income toward student loan payments, this can extend the time it takes to accumulate that first down payment.

One borrower, Heather, told us she owes $115,000 in student loans from earning her degrees, half of which are private student loans. She loves her job as a nurse, but she also wrote, “I would also love to buy a new car and buy a home which I won’t be able to do for a very long time.” 11

The chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association noted that student debt will “have an extraordinary dampening effect on young peoples’ ability to borrow for a home, and that’s going to impact the housing market and the economy at large.” The National Association of Home Builders wrote to the Bureau about the relatively low share of first-time homebuyers in the market compared to historical levels and that student debt can “impair the ability of recent college graduates to qualify for a loan.” 12

Another borrower, Michelle, told us that she would be able to pay less per month if she bought a home rather than rented. But she was told her debt relative to her income meant that she could not qualify for a mortgage. 13

With lower levels of first-time buyers in the market, this also poses problems for existing homeowners. William Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said recently that student debt’s impact on first-time homeownership “makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.” 14

And the impact isn’t limited to those who want to buy a home. One realtor told us how she routinely checks credit reports for prospective renters. With student loans soaking up so much of their incomes, many applications end up being denied. With so many young Americans living with parents or roommates rather than forming their own households, this might have a material impact on purchases of other goods, like furniture and appliances.

Small Business and Entrepreneurship

Small business plays a critical role in creating opportunity and wealth in our economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, small businesses, defined as an independent entity having fewer than 500 employees, created two-thirds of net new jobs from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2012. But student debt may be stymying the efforts of entrepreneurs to sustain and grow their businesses.

One aspiring entrepreneur, Julie, wrote, “I am in the process of starting a business, but am unsure as to whether I can afford to because I have so much student loan debt.” 15

In submissions to the Bureau by coalitions of small businesses and startups, groups cited a number of potential negative impacts of student debt on entrepreneurship, such as access to credit and willingness to take financial risks. There has been an increasing amount of evidence to support these hypotheses.

Preliminary research on student debt and small business formation finds a “significant and economically meaningful negative correlation between changes in student loan debt and net business formation” for small businesses employing 1-4 employees. 16 Unlike larger firms with more seamless access to capital markets, small businesses often rely heavily on the owner’s personal access to credit used primarily for business purposes.

Longitudinal surveys of small businesses illustrate the outsized role that personal credit cards and personal bank loans play in financing the enterprise’s growth and survival. In early years, surviving small businesses rapidly increase their employment, while also heavily utilizing these forms of financing. One of the top reasons for denial of credit to small businesses is attributed to the owner’s personal credit profile. 17

In roundtable discussions with entrepreneurs, founders describe that their student debt forces them to take cash out of the business to make their payments, making it tougher to “bootstrap.” Those early revenues could otherwise be reinvested to hire employees or to expand their product offerings. Others have told the Bureau that prospective investors are concerned when founders have heavy student debt burdens, since the entrepreneur may be unable to maintain an extended period of negative cash flow or may be tempted to leave for a higher salary at a larger firm.

Retirement Security and Asset Accumulation

The impact of heavy student debt burdens may also have a longer-term effect on the ability of households to save and accumulate wealth for retirement. One borrower, Kristi, was quite straightforward when telling us about saving for retirement, “Don’t make me laugh! We can’t save for retirement because we need all of our money for these loans.” 18

Tabulations of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances reveals a large lag in net worth for younger households with student debt. Households headed by a younger college-educated adult had a net worth of just $8,700 – approximately 85% less than equivalent households without student debt, despite nearly identical household income between debtors and non-debtors. The difference is even more dramatic for student debtors who did not complete a bachelor’s degree. 19

Student debt can also have more long-term impacts on an individual’s financial security. Due to the shift away from defined benefit plans and toward 401(k)s, IRAs and other defined contribution plans, ensuring a secure retirement will be largely self-directed for most young workers. Young workers who are able to make early, sizable contributions to these plans can generate significant retirement assets over the course of their careers. But student debt may be impeding workers from making sizable contributions – or even contributing at all.

Recent analysis by the largest provider of employer-based defined contribution plans indicates that 43 percent of young workers participate in their employers’ plans, compared to approximately 70 percent of workers ages 35 to 64. For the greater than two-thirds of employers that do not feature automatic enrollment, participation in these plans by young workers drops to just 23 percent. 20

And according to two industry analyses, 43 percent of young workers do not save enough to receive a full employer match 22 and are more likely to cash out their plans when changing jobs. 22

If student debt acts as a headwind to young worker participation in retirement plans, the opportunity for wealth accumulation diminishes significantly. One recent estimate considered the impact of an average level of student loan debt for a college-educated household compared to a similarly situated debt-free household. The analysis found that student debt could crowd out more than $200,000 in net assets over a borrower’s working life, including a loss of nearly $135,000 in net retirement savings. 23

The impact on retirement security is not limited to younger workers – many older households are forced to reevaluate their retirement plans in light of debt used to finance the education of a child or grandchild. AARP wrote to the Bureau about the impact of student debt on families headed by households over the age of 50, noting that “increasing debt threatens their ability to save for retirement or accumulate other assets, and may end up requiring them to delay retirement.” 24

Health Care, Education and Rural America

The impact of student debt might also skew labor market outcomes. Notably, heavy debt burdens exacerbate the challenges that many communities face when seeking to attract and retain health care professionals and teachers. These problems may be felt even more acutely in rural America.

The American Medical Association noted that high debt burdens can impact the career choices of new doctors, leading some to abandon caring for the elderly or children for more lucrative specialties. 25 New research validates these concerns — the share of new medical school graduates pursuing primary care specialties has declined steadily since 2009 and student debt has been found to have been a statistically significant deterrent on the selection of primary care practice by some medical students. 26
The impact of rising student debt on graduates’ ability to practice in primary care is not limited to physicians. Tara, a nurse working in primary care at a community health clinic told us she “could not in good conscience recommend primary care as a career choice for others” due to her student debt burden. 27

Many graduates pursuing careers in many public service professions share the same concerns. One borrower told us how she was unable to find a repayment plan that made her debt manageable and ultimately chose to abandon her career as a teacher in order to pursue more lucrative work in the private sector. 28 Recent research has shown that for every $10,000 in additional student debt, young graduates are 6% less likely to pursue a career in public service, especially careers as teachers. 29

Classroom teachers submitted letters detailing the impact of private student loan debt, for which forgiveness programs or income-based repayment options are usually not offered. One school district official wrote to the Bureau noting that programs to make student debt more manageable could lead to higher retention of quality teachers. 30

These trends may pose additional challenges to rural communities, where young graduates with already-strained household balance sheets may have limited access to affordable rental housing and may discover that car ownership is a prerequisite for employment. With many rural medical professionals operating in solo practices, high debt levels might reduce availability to secure initial financing.

Student debt can also impact the availability of other professions critical to the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers in rural communities. According to an annual survey conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association, 89 percent of veterinary students are graduating with debt, averaging $151,672 per borrower. 31 Veterinarians encumbered with high debt burdens may be unable to make ends meet in a dairy medicine or livestock management practice in remote areas.

Accountability for Student Loan Servicers

Loan servicers are the primary point of contact on student loans for more than 40 million Americans. High-quality servicing can contribute to an individual borrower’s ability to successfully repay their debt, especially through enrollment into affordable repayment plans.

As the recession decimated the job market for young graduates, a growing share of student loan borrowers reached out to their servicers for help. But the problems they have encountered bear an uncanny resemblance to the problems faced by struggling homeowners when dealing with their mortgage servicers. Like many of the improper and unnecessary foreclosures experienced by many homeowners, I am concerned that inadequate servicing has contributed to America’s growing student loan default problem, now topping 7 million Americans in default on over $100 billion in balances.

The Bureau has received thousands of complaints from borrowers describing the difficulties they face with their student loan servicers. Borrowers have told the Bureau about a range of problems, from payment processing errors to servicing transfer surprises to loan modification challenges. To ensure that we do not see a repeat of the breakdowns and chaos in the mortgage servicing market, it will be critical to ensure that student loan servicers are providing adequate customer service and following the law.

Canary in the Coal Mine

In the mortgage market, a particularly disconcerting occurrence involved the foreclosures faced by active-duty servicemembers, despite prohibitions under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). Like in the mortgage market, the treatment of servicemembers by student loan servicers has been quite troubling. Rather than receiving clear and accurate information, many military families have found themselves buried in and blindfolded by red tape from their student loan servicers.

My colleague Holly Petraeus, who leads the Bureau’s Office of Servicemember Affairs, and I also published a report describing the obstacles military families face when attempting to access their student loan repayment benefits provided by applicable laws. 32 For example, men and women in uniform are entitled to a 6 percent rate cap on their student loans incurred prior to entering active-duty status, as provided for by the SCRA. Unfortunately, some servicers have placed inappropriate requirements on servicemembers seeking the rate cap.

For example, one servicemember who filed a complaint with the Bureau saw his request to his servicer rejected multiple times because his military orders did not include an end date. This is neither a requirement of the SCRA, nor feasible for many military commissioned officers to obtain, as their orders usually do not delineate an end date. Another servicemember with multiple loans sought to reduce the rate on his highest-rate loans, but, simultaneously, the servicer proceeded to raise the rate on the loans that were below 6 percent.

Improper and potentially unlawful servicing errors can cause harm to servicemembers. Admittedly, military families are a small segment of the population. But if a servicer is unable to provide adequate service to those who have special protections under the law, it raises questions about whether it is agile enough to deal with the complexities of the larger population of borrowers facing hardship.

Strengthening Student Loan Servicing

Unlike most markets for consumer products and services, student loan borrowers generally don’t get to choose their student loan servicer. And with few opportunities to refinance with a new provider, a consumer cannot easily take his or her business elsewhere. Ordinary market forces won’t guarantee reasonable customer service, while potentially magnifying incentives to cut corners.

The past decade offers a useful case study about the potential impact of conflicting incentives. In 2004, the Department of the Treasury finalized the privatization of the Student Loan Marketing Association, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) better known as Sallie Mae. This year, SLM Corp., the GSE’s successor company, ceased operating in its current form. 33

During the ten years the successor corporation operated, it generated substantial revenue through government contracts for student loan servicing and debt collection. The company also benefitted from several government-supported emergency programs as problems in the capital markets emerged. 34 Despite these benefits received from the public, the corporation was found to be violating the law on multiple occasions by state authorities, 35 banking regulators, 36 and federal auditors. 37

And just last month, after referrals from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and the FDIC ordered Sallie Mae and Navient to pay nearly $100 million in restitution and penalties for violating multiple laws. Regulators determined 38 that the companies were:

Unfairly conditioning receipt of benefits under the SCRA upon requirements not found in the law
Improperly advising servicemembers that they must be deployed to receive benefits under the SCRA
Failing to provide complete SCRA relief to servicemembers after having been put on notice of these borrowers’ active duty status
Inadequately disclosing its payment allocation methodologies to borrowers while allocating borrowers’ payments across multiple loans in a manner that maximizes late fees
Misrepresenting and inadequately disclosing in its billing statements how borrowers could avoid late fees
The FDIC also noted in the consent order that there were violations of additional consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. 39

While the post-GSE corporation no longer operates in the form it took immediately post-privatization, the challenges it experienced offer a reminder that regulators must be vigilant to protect consumers, since ordinary market forces in the student loan market may not fully align incentives among all market participants.

The Bureau recently finalized a rule that will allow the agency to supervise larger nonbank student loan servicers, closing a significant gap in oversight for compliance with federal consumer financial laws.

In a recent report analyzing student loan complaints related to payment processing and servicing transfers, I recommended that Congress consider the applicability of recent reforms to the credit card and mortgage servicing markets to determine whether they might help the student loan servicing market function more efficiently. 40

For example, many consumers who wish to pay down their loans more quickly find that student loan servicers allocate payments in ways that might increase the amount of total interest they will pay, slowing them down on the path to be debt-free. For credit card borrowers with balances at multiple rates, generally, prepayments are allocated to balances at the highest interest rate, facilitating faster repayment of debt with minimal bureaucratic burden.

Refinance and Restructure

For borrowers who graduated into a difficult labor market, high student debt burdens have added insult to injury. Borrowers and industry observers have repeatedly noted that, unlike other markets, refinance opportunities are few and far between. In a report published last May, we discussed ways to jumpstart a student loan refinance market and spur loan restructuring. 41

Among borrowers who have dutifully managed their monthly payments on high-interest student loans, many told us that they would like an opportunity to refinance. When mortgage borrowers see rates plummet, their incomes rise, or their credit profiles improve, they try to refinance. Responsible student loan borrowers rarely have these options. Fortunately, since our May 2013 report, we have seen some market participants expand their offerings to borrowers, offering them lower rates that can lead to substantial savings over the life of the loan. 42

While the vast majority of outstanding student loan debt is guaranteed or directly lent by the federal government, solutions to promote affordability of student loans must consider the role of private student loans. High-debt borrowers graduating amidst the financial crisis disproportionately used private student loans. According to an analysis of borrowers graduating from a four-year college in 2008 with more than $40,000 in debt, 81% used private student loans. 43

Unlike federal student loans, which include a range of loan modification options to keep payments affordable, private student loan borrowers rarely have these options. The report describes ways to create a uniform framework for borrowers to restructure their private student loans so loan restructuring activity can be dramatically increased, while simultaneously reducing borrower distress.

BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, noted that “initiatives targeted at young workers with high levels of student indebtedness, perhaps surprisingly to some, have an outsize impact in supporting the housing recovery and financial markets.” 44 More robust refinancing and loan restructuring that reduces the burden of student debt can benefit borrowers, market participants, and the economy more broadly.

Demystify with Data and Transparency

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen once noted that, prior to the crisis, financial regulators “missed some of the important linkages whereby problems in mortgages would rebound through the financial system.” 45 The opacity and our collective lack of understanding of the mortgage market had serious consequences for the economy.

While there have been major strides to better assemble mortgage data, the opacity of the student loan market remains deeply problematic, adding further uncertainty over the potential spillovers into the rest of the economy. I am quite concerned that financial regulators and the public lack access to basic, fundamental data on student loan origination and performance. Without these data, we will be challenged to understand the complete set of risks posed by student debt burdens.

Most loan-level mortgage origination data is currently subject to public disclosure, stripped of borrower-identifiable information, under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 46 Data from housing GSEs and mortgage-backed securities filings shed significant light on loan-level performance. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regularly publishes a mortgage metrics report, detailing loan modification performance and other key servicing data. 47

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council collects reports from insured depository institutions on balance sheet holdings, but student loans are aggregated with many other types of non-mortgage credit products. SEC filings from large financial institutions rarely report key data on student loans. Student loan ABS filings and servicer performance reports are much less granular than similar mortgage reports. Unsurprisingly, the drivers of prepayment, delinquency, and default in the student loan market are not well understood by investors and financial analysts. Questionable accuracy of student loan credit reporting data adds further uncertainty.

We must also seek to better understand how student debt is distributed among various segments of the population. The American Association of University Women, citing its 2012 analysis of borrower debt burden, noted that a much higher portion of female college graduates are shouldering heavy debt burdens relative to their income, compared to similarly-situated males. 48

According to the College Board, 49 black students graduating from college in 2008 at the onset of the financial crisis were more likely to have higher levels of debt than other students. Black students were more likely to use private student loans. 50 In addition, an analysis of the Current Population Survey from the Center for Economic and Policy Research reveals that unemployment for black recent college graduates was more than double that of the entire population of recent college graduates in 2013. Even black recent college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields experienced higher than average unemployment. Differences in underemployment rates also showed similar trends. 51 Understanding both loan usage and employment patterns can help determine borrower populations where distress may be more acute.

The Bureau is coordinating with other regulators on potential ways to enhance the quality of publicly-reported data. Over the longer term, we must aim to reduce the transparency gap between the mortgage and student loan markets. This can lead to more efficient market monitoring and shed light on the linkages between student indebtedness and other sectors of the economy. Better data and transparency will help us to better understand the demographics and professions where borrowers may be experiencing distress, as well as whether lenders and servicers are fairly serving their customers.

Preserving the Dream

Our country was built on the promise that if each of us played our part, contributed our labor, our enterprise and our knowledge, the only limit to our success was our own work ethic. College has served as a gateway to opportunity for millions to climb the ladder and achieve their dreams. And the individual rewards of our hard work – owning a car, buying our first home, and securing a comfortable retirement – continue to define the American dream.

But in the aftermath of the Great Recession, behind all of the facts and statistics, is a much broader question – how do we preserve the drive to succeed for so many who feel that the dream is now out of reach?

For borrowers like Andrea, student debt is a direct threat. She writes, “How can someone even dream of taking out a mortgage to purchase a home when she is struggling to pay back student debt? How can a person think of starting a family if he already owes so much money? How can a potential entrepreneur take the risk to start her dream business when she knows that failure will not only mean losing that investment, but everything else as well? We go to college to open doors, to pursue what we truly want out of a fulfilling life. Massive student debt debilitates this mission.” 52

Ignoring the warning signs may prove to hold back not only the future growth and dynamism of our economy, but also our spirits. Addressing these concerns in the near-term may pay dividends for many years to follow.

Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s hearing, and I look forward to discussing potential solutions to help borrowers climb the economic ladder and stop the student debt domino effect.

Executive Summary

This Issue Spotlight explores the challenges that recipients of public cash assistance encounter in accessing funds through financial products or services. Cash assistance predominantly flows to low-income families in need or individuals at a precarious time.1 This includes older Americans via Social Security, low-income children and families via Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), people with disabilities via Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and people who are recently unemployed via unemployment payments. Given the often-acute needs of the populations who receive and rely on cash assistance, it is critical that beneficiaries have full and timely access to these funds.

This Issue Spotlight analyzes the structure of the delivery systems for certain public benefits programs, focusing on TANF, Unemployment programs, and various Social Security payments. It also summarizes CFPB consumer complaints and the results of focus groups with cash assistance recipients.

Cash assistance can be subject to numerous fees that cut into the amount of assistance and can be subject to inaccessible funds due to inadequate customer service. This Issue Spotlight focuses in particular on assistance provided on prepaid cards because of specific recurring issues we have seen arising with the provision of benefits by that method. More specifically,

Consumers can be encouraged by programs to receive their cash assistance through a prepaid card provided by a particular financial institution rather than through direct deposit to an account and financial institution of their choice.
Some prepaid card providers charge numerous fees, such as maintenance, balance inquiry, customer service, or ATM fees, that chip away at people's benefits.
Inadequate customer service from prepaid card providers means that a single problem, such as unauthorized charges on a card, can create a cascade of problems when customer service isn’t available or responsive in a timely manner.

One barrier to reform may be the decentralized nature of public benefits programs that offer cash assistance. Many federal, state, and local entities are involved in running and overseeing these programs. Each program, whether administered by federal or state government, sets up its own system for paying out cash assistance. This decentralized system leaves programs largely unaware of the features of products for which other programs are contracting and creates inconsistencies in products.

Recipients also often have minimal choice in how they receive cash assistance. When cash assistance is provided through a government-administered prepaid card, recipients do not get to choose the specific card and are locked into a relationship with the provider selected by program administrators. Additionally, relatively few vendors participate in the market for government-administered prepaid cards. For these reasons, providers may face minimal competitive pressure from program innovation, new entrants, or customer choice, which may exacerbate or cause the issues with fees and customer service that benefits recipients face.

The CFPB will continue to monitor the practices of entities that facilitate the provision of cash assistance and take action when appropriate to protect consumers from violations of the federal consumer financial laws. We will also collaborate with federal and state agencies that administer public benefits programs to support efforts to increase competition and efficiency in the delivery of cash assistance.

Section 1: Public benefits delivery

Government entities provide cash assistance through a range of programs that were intended to serve many populations—including older adults, individuals with disabilities, people who are unemployed, and low-income families with children. Public benefits programs provide recurring or one-time cash assistance,2 “near cash,”3 or in-kind4 benefits to individuals and families.5 In this Issue Spotlight, we focus specifically on the distribution of recurring cash assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)6, unemployment compensation (“Unemployment”)7, and various Social Security payments. These programs provide cash funds to cover individuals’ essential needs, making it all the more critical that beneficiaries have full and timely access to their cash benefits.

Social Security is administered by the Social Security Administration and thus is delivered in a uniform way across the United States. In contrast, TANF and Unemployment are both administered by states (and in some cases, by county administrators), leading to significant variation in program structure and delivery. TANF’s block grant structure leaves broad discretion to states to determine eligibility criteria and benefit amount.8 Unemployment is an umbrella term referring to several programs involving cash assistance payments to individuals who have lost their job.9 Federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on Unemployment coverage and eligibility. State laws and regulations determine specific eligibility requirements, payment amounts, and duration. In turn, this state-based discretion has resulted in essentially 53 different program implementations, though with some commonalities across programs.10

Public cash assistance is provided by direct deposit, government-administered prepaid cards, or paper checks.11 The administrator of each program decides which of these three options to offer to recipients, subject to any relevant restrictions. One such restriction that applies to the delivery of certain public benefits is the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), implemented through Regulation E.12 EFTA generally provides, among other things, that recipients cannot be required to establish an account with a particular financial institution as a condition of receipt of a government benefit without an alternative.13 EFTA applies to both federally-administered benefits, (including Federal needs-tested programs) as well as state and local government benefits that are not needs-tested programs.14 Accordingly, distribution of federal cash assistance—such as Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and federal tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit—are subject to EFTA; recipients of cash assistance provided by these programs cannot be required to receive their funds with a specific financial institution, whether on a prepaid card or to a deposit account. Similarly, state and locally administered programs subject to EFTA include Unemployment, child support, certain prison and jail ‘‘gate money’’ benefits, and pension plan payments. In contrast, needs-tested programs administered by states to which EFTA does not apply include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

In order for a cash assistance recipient to receive their funds through direct deposit, they must be able to provide an account and routing number for an existing bank, credit union, or prepaid card account. However, a significant number of cash assistance recipients may not be able to use this option as they lack such an account. In 2021, of the households in the United States most likely to receive cash assistance—those with incomes under $30,000—an estimated 4.1 million of them lacked a bank or credit union account (i.e., are “unbanked”).15

Another common way of distributing cash assistance is through government-administered prepaid cards. The two main types of government-administered prepaid cards are the electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system and the electronic payment card (EPC) system. Benefit payments provided through EBT16 allow individuals to get their cash assistance through a network of ATMs and selected merchants that accept EBT cards, whereas EPC cards are branded as Visa or MasterCard, allowing recipients to use these cards to access cash or purchase items through any merchant that accepts those cards.17 As of July 2020, 40 states issued TANF payments via EBT, while 10 states issued TANF payments via EPC.18 To offer government-administered prepaid cards that participants can then use to make purchases and withdraw cash, program administrators contract with service providers; this market will be discussed further in Section 2.

Government-administered prepaid cards provide an important vehicle to distribute cash assistance, even in cases where it transfers only a small fraction of the overall benefits. In 2020, government-administered prepaid cards were used to distribute $409 billion in public benefits, the bulk of which was cash assistance.19 The Social Security Administration, for example, paid out approximately 4.5 percent of the Administration’s benefits on its government-administered prepaid card in 2020.20

Government-administered prepaid cards offer both advantages and disadvantages; their use can benefit government administrators and recipients alike. By reducing supplies needed and demands on employee time, cards provide cost-efficiency for administrators.21 They also present an opportunity for faster access to funds for unbanked recipients over check-cashing. However, some prepaid cards can also present substantial consumer burdens, such as costly fees to access funds, or user experience hurdles, like unresponsive customer service lines, for cash assistance recipients.

Though less frequently used, paper checks are still an option at the discretion of the agency administering public benefits. Practices vary widely from program to program. For instance, paper checks are not available to most Social Security benefits recipients.22 Further, individuals who receive Unemployment in Montana may choose to receive a paper check,23 whereas Unemployment recipients in Alabama may only receive payment by direct deposit or on their government-administered prepaid card.24 In 2020, 21 states allowed consumers to receive their TANF cash payments via paper check.25

Section 2: Barriers to accessing cash assistance

Cash assistance predominantly flows to families in need or individuals at an insecure time. Barriers to accessing that assistance, such as numerous or costly fees or inadequate customer service, can create substantial financial harm. These concerns are not limited to cash assistance provided by prepaid card, but the provision of benefits by prepaid card presents specific recurring issues. Although recipients may sometimes choose the method by which their cash assistance is delivered, in the programs the CFPB examined, recipients do not have a say in the specific prepaid card program administrators use to distribute cash assistance. This presents the potential for consumer harm because a particular prepaid card may not meet a consumer’s unique financial needs.

Fees reduce benefit amounts

Government-administered prepaid cards can have numerous or costly fees associated with their use that may exceed that of other financial products or services.26 Consumers have complained to the CFPB about service fees on their government benefits cards.27 That said, the alternatives to government-administered prepaid cards—direct deposit and paper checks—can also be a source of fees.

State agencies that offer prepaid cards execute contracts with vendors, which can represent a cost saving opportunity to states over processing paper checks repeatedly.28 The prepaid card vendors that states select earn income on cardholder29 and sometimes, interchange30 fees. This relationship structure risks potential misalignment between states’ interest in programmatic cost cutting, vendors’ interest in earning revenue, and the consumer’s desire for a safe and affordable prepaid card to meet their financial needs.

While there are potential convenience and economic advantages for recipients to using government-administered prepaid cards, those benefits may be blunted by large service fees. In 2020, for example, issuers of government-administered prepaid cards collected approximately $1.3 billion in fees.31 While this fee revenue reflects only 0.3% of the $409 billion distributed, these fees may have a significant impact on the individual consumers that pay them. Additionally, public benefits recipients may have little-to-no ability to avoid these fees due to their limited ability to choose or change their card provider; they are often locked into relationships with providers chosen by the program administrator.

Common government-administered prepaid card fees can include ATM, maintenance, balance inquiry, or customer service fees. The assessment of these fees on government-administered prepaid cards has been the subject of complaints to the CFPB, as illustrated by one consumer complaint:

“I had my unemployment compensation disbursed to the provided. Each time my benefits were debited to the account they were immediately credited back under a 'Transaction Type ' called 'RETURN UNPINNED DEPOSIT '. […] I contacted the customer service phone number for [the card] at XXXX ten times through XX/XX/XXXX- they even charged me for each phone call. There is a record of this on my statement.”32

The three largest sources of cardholder fee revenue for government-administered prepaid card providers in 2020 were ATM fees, account servicing fees, and customer service inquiry fees.33

Our review of prepaid cards issued by Unemployment programs indicates that the fees for the same service vary across states, even among states that contract with the same financial institution. For instance, Unemployment prepaid card users in some states pay up to $2 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals or up to $14 for replacements cards, while recipients in other states pay nothing for those same services.34 This is also in contrast to many credit or debit card holders who pay nothing to replace a lost or stolen card.35 Figure 1 shows the variation in out-of-network fees across states. A handful of Unemployment cards also charge in-network ATM withdrawal fees, though these fees may only apply after a certain number of free in-network transactions.36 These variations in fee schedules across states and programs are dictated by the contracts signed by program administrators with financial institutions. The range of fee structures demonstrates that program administrators may have room to negotiate better prepaid card arrangements that limit costs and provide better customer service to recipients of cash assistance.

While Unemployment payments vary from state to state, fees on these cards can represent a significant portion of a recently unemployed consumer’s temporary cash assistance.38 Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing additional payments, the “average weekly benefits were about $387 nationwide but ranged from a low of $215 in Mississippi to $550 in Massachusetts, and were only $161 in Puerto Rico.”39 At these payment levels, replacing a lost card can cost a recipient almost 4% of their average weekly benefit; $2 out-of-network ATM fees that may be relatively insignificant individually can accumulate to diminish cash assistance that is intended to provide financial stability to people who had been working but lost their jobs. As Unemployment replaces income for only a short period of time, the cumulative costs of those fees can place a significant burden on consumers during a period when they are already facing financial hardship. These fees may disrupt a recipient’s ability to pay their rent or mortgage, buy groceries, or purchase other necessities.

The CFPB has observed similar fee variations in the cards used to distribute TANF.40 Some of these EBT or EPC cards charge familiar fees such as out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees, but some programs’ cards charge recipients additional fees, such as a fee to check their account balance at an ATM,41 to call customer service,42 or to receive a “mobile balance alert.”43 Many TANF cards limit the number of free transactions available to users, even in network.44 Because recipients don’t have a choice in selecting the program’s prepaid products on which they receive their assistance, they may not always know what services are available to them, at what cost, or where they can access funds without incurring fees.

Individuals with minimal resources who rely on cash assistance for necessities can experience outsized harm from even low-dollar fees. In California in 2012, the ATM fees on TANF cards were estimated to total $19 million across approximately 450,000 recipient families, or approximately $43 per family per year.45 TANF provides modest payments to very low-income families, even when they receive the maximum monthly benefit, and that is important context in considering the impact of fees. These fees average out to $3.60 per month per family; while that is a low dollar amount, it could also represent, for example, a round trip fare on public transportation.46 These fees may also more acutely affect people who live in rural areas where it may be difficult to access in-network ATMs and users may be forced to incur out-of-network ATM fees, which are often substantially higher.

Inadequate customer service

Complaints to the CFPB about government-administered prepaid cards consistently reflect concerns about the adequacy of customer service. At its core, a functioning customer service system ensures consumers can fully utilize their funds. Full utilization includes an ability to rectify any problems with their government-administered prepaid card; consumers must be able address freezes and unauthorized charges on their financial products. Issues raised by consumers include inadequate protections against unauthorized transfers, high costs to replace a card, and insufficient or hypersensitive fraud filters that cause delays and account freezing.47 These issues intersect, and then can be exacerbated by the company’s poor customer service when consumers need help to resolve any of these issues. Inadequate customer service from prepaid card providers means that if any issue with a card arises (such as a lost card or unauthorized charges), a recipient can be without beneﬁts for weeks to months while they wait for a resolution.48

As discussed in Section 1, above, EFTA applies to the delivery of some, but not all, public benefits. Where it applies, EFTA provides specific error resolution rights and dispute procedures.49 Regardless of whether EFTA applies, prepaid card providers50 and financial institutions providing consumer financial products and services, such as government-administered prepaid cards, are subject to the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA)’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.51 For example, the Bureau has addressed prohibited acts and practices under the CFPA as well as under EFTA and its implementing Regulation E related to the distribution of Unemployment cash assistance in a coordinated enforcement action with the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), through which the CFPB fined Bank of America $100 million in civil money penalties. The CFPB’s order also requires Bank of America to pay eligible consumers redress related to its violations of the CFPA and Regulation E.52

The intersecting nature of customer service obstacles are present in complaints to the CFPB. One problem, such as unauthorized charges on a card, can create a cascade of problems when customer service isn’t available or responsive in a timely manner. This dynamic is illustrated by a complaint submitted to the CFPB:

“[I] noticed my account had unauthorized transactions. I called and reported it immediately and had the card shut off and claims put in for the transactions. I was told to wait for a questionnaire to fill out …The questionnaire never arrived I called in on the morning of the XXXX and was told to type a statement and include my police report of the theft with it. I did that and faxed it to them. I called back in 8 hours later to make sure they received the fax and was told my claims had been denied.”53

In fact, some consumers describe a complete inability to reach customer service representatives.54 These challenges are illustrated by another complaint submitted to the CFPB:

“I was informed … there was a total of $ XXXX dollars taken from this account by someone other than myself. … I called number after number NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE,” (emphasis in original).55

Consumers receiving multiple forms of cash assistance are often asked to use several cards to access benefits, requiring them to manage their finances and fees across different platforms. This may seem to be an inefficient system, however, until benefits recipients can access customer support when an issue arises, a single, centralized card may not be ideal for the cash assistance recipient. For example, if a recipient were to have all of their benefits on a single card and they experience any issue (theft, for example), then all beneﬁts may be cut off until the issue is resolved, which may take days, weeks, or months.

Lack of consumer choice

As a general matter, there is potential for consumer harm when cash assistance recipients do not have a meaningful choice in how they receive their payments.56 A particular product that a consumer is required to use may not meet their financial needs. Moreover, the problems described above regarding fees and customer service may be exacerbated or caused by a marketplace in which providers face minimal competitive pressure.

As discussed in Section 1, above, consumer financial protection laws require consumer choice for certain cash assistance payments. EFTA, where it applies, prohibits financial institutions or other persons from requiring consumers to receive payments on a specific prepaid card with no alternative options.57 In October 2021, the Bureau took action against prison financial services company JPay for, among other things, violating EFTA and Regulation E when consumers in certain states were required to receive a government benefit owed to them at the time of their release from prison or jail on a JPay prepaid debit card.58

Even for benefits programs protected by EFTA and Regulation E, consumers that choose to receive their benefits by prepaid card do not have a choice in which company is selected by the government to provide the card. Instead, states develop contracts with a specific provider. Consumers therefore are not able to choose a product with terms or features that meets their specific needs. Because the consumer is the end-user of the cash assistance but does not select the product for disbursement and cannot switch to a different product, providers have reduced incentives to prioritize product quality and ease of use. Moreover, there is a risk that companies will take unfair advantage of recipients who are locked into a relationship with that particular provider, such as by charging complicated or large service fees.

Although some program administrators may prioritize consumer needs in the contracting process, consumer needs are not inherently part of product selection. Further, program administrators may not be fully aware of barriers to access to funds, and they may not be able to fully account for different needs among diverse groups of consumers.

Currently, the vendor marketplace offering governments prepaid cards is limited to a small number of providers. According to the CFPB’s analysis, only six banks contract with states for Unemployment government-administered prepaid cards. While four companies were under contract to provide EBT cards to states in 2022, just two companies held more than 95% of the EBT contracts.59 Within this limited marketplace, companies may face limited competitive pressure in the contracting process even if program administrators are aware of and prioritize consumer needs. The limited provider marketplace itself may be a result of operating requirements set by program administrators and customer use case. These and other factors could place pressure on some providers to generate expected revenue.

Further, programs that technically offer a choice about how benefits may be received may fail to make the options clear to the consumer or to provide access to them.60 Where EFTA applies, under Regulation E certain disclosures about payment options are required.61 Nonetheless, one consumer complained to the CFPB about their Unemployment payments being directed to a prepaid card against their wishes:

“I never used this card because I did not request it. When I completed my initial unemployment application, I requested direct deposit. 5 weeks of unemployment insurance money totaling {$1800.00} was sent to this card. […] The [agency] when I went to their office after emailing them for months & no response to my emails only confirmed the amounts and when the money was sent each week to the card. I am frustrated that no one is doing their job.”62

Additionally, how programs present options to consumers may have a significant effect on what payment method consumers select. For example, one state includes a link to sign up for direct deposit on the login page for its prepaid card.63 Other states do not present payment alternatives as clearly or accessibly. Research shows that even minor differences in application forms and sign-up processes can have dramatic effects on people's behavior.64

Conclusion and next steps

Public benefits programs offering cash assistance provide an important financial safety net to millions of low-income families and individuals at financially precarious points in their lives. Safe and efficient delivery of these benefits is essential, as it allows individuals to effectively manage their financial lives.

Cash assistance recipients are sometimes offered—or assigned—costly or inaccessible financial products on which they receive their benefits. There are relatively few vendors in the marketplace for government-administered prepaid cards, and the consumer is the end-user of the benefits but has little-to-no input on product selection. These factors may minimize the competitive forces that can improve financial products or services. There is also a risk that companies are not motivated to improve their products because they don’t have a direct relationship with the end user consumers who are locked into a relationship with the provider selected by program administrators. These challenges ultimately undermine the financial well-being of cash assistance recipients by siphoning government funds from eligible individuals and redirecting government dollars to financial institutions.

Cash assistance recipients should be protected from financial harm just like any other consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is committed to making sure entities subject to federal consumer financial laws—including those involved in the delivery of cash assistance—comply with their obligations. Specifically, the CFPB will monitor and, when appropriate, take action against entities that violate the federal consumer financial laws with respect to the delivery of cash assistance.

The CFPB is sharing this Issue Spotlight with federal and state agencies that administer public benefits programs to support efforts to increase competition or otherwise address the issues raised in this Spotlight. To ensure that cash assistance recipients get the full benefit of the funds made available to them, program administrators may want to consider changes to their benefits delivery systems to increase safety, minimize fees, improve customer service, and increase choice and competition.

Endnotes
Public benefits programs generally use the term “cash assistance” for a narrower range of means-tested cash programs. This Issue Spotlight broadens that category to include all public benefits programs that provide cash, rather than near-cash or in-kind benefits. This Issue Spotlight analyzes recurring cash payments that fall under both social welfare and social insurance public benefits programs.
In addition to recurring public benefits payments, even more Americans receive broad cash assistance payments during national emergencies, such as COVID Economic Impact Payments (EIP).6F Congress issued three rounds of EIP to consumers, subject to income limits: EIP1 under the CARES Act; EIP2 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA); and EIP3 under the American Rescue Plan Act. The IRS distributed these payments to consumers, based on information they provided on Federal tax returns, generally through direct deposit to their deposit accounts of record or through physical checks.
Examples of “near cash” benefits are Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which allow discretionary spending but only on approved items at credentialed retailers, or Section 8 vouchers.

For example, effective and safe administration of public benefits—getting the accurate amount of cash assistance to eligible recipients—is essential to maintaining financial stability for the programs, and ultimately, for the programs’ intended beneficiaries. As such, most public benefits systems require that the potential recipient self-identify and apply for any benefits for which they believe they are eligible, with supporting documentation to demonstrate their eligibility, rather than proactively identifying eligible recipients. COVID EIP payments are one recent notable exception. They were disbursed to tax filers based on their previous year’s income level.
Sometimes recipients may choose between all three options and for some benefits programs, options are limited. For example, paper checks are not available to most Social Security, SSI, or Veteran’s benefits recipients, see, Treasury’s Direct Express website, www.fiscal.treasury.gov/directexpress .

Adverse action notification requirements and the proper use of the CFPB’s sample forms provided in Regulation B
Question presented

When using artificial intelligence or complex credit models, may creditors rely on the checklist of reasons provided in CFPB sample forms for adverse action notices even when those sample reasons do not accurately or specifically identify the reasons for the adverse action?

Response

No, creditors may not rely on the checklist of reasons provided in the sample forms (currently codified in Regulation B) to satisfy their obligations under ECOA if those reasons do not specifically and accurately indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. Nor, as a general matter, may creditors rely on overly broad or vague reasons to the extent that they obscure the specific and accurate reasons relied upon.

Analysis

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), implemented by Regulation B, makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.1 ECOA and Regulation B require that, when taking adverse action against an applicant, a creditor must provide the applicant with a statement of reasons for the action taken.2 This statement of reasons must be “specific” and indicate the “principal reason(s) for the adverse action”3; moreover, the specific reasons disclosed must “relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.”4 Adverse action notice requirements promote fairness and equal opportunity for consumers engaged in credit transactions, by serving as a tool to prevent and identify discrimination through the requirement that creditors must affirmatively explain their decisions. In addition, such notices provide consumers with a key educational tool allowing them to understand the reasons for a creditor’s action and take steps to improve their credit status or rectify mistakes made by creditors.5

The CFPB provides sample forms (currently codified in Regulation B) that creditors may use to satisfy their adverse action notification requirements, if appropriate. These forms include a checklist of sample reasons for adverse action which “creditors most commonly consider,”6 as well as an open-ended field for creditors to provide other reasons not listed. The sample forms are used by creditors to satisfy certain adverse action notice requirements under ECOA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), though the statutory obligations under each remain distinct.7 While the sample forms provide examples of commonly considered reasons for taking adverse action, “[t]he sample forms are illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors.”8 Reliance on the checklist of reasons provided in the sample forms will satisfy a creditor’s adverse action notification requirements only if the reasons disclosed are specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action taken.

Some creditors use complex algorithms involving “artificial intelligence” and other predictive decision-making technologies in their underwriting models.9 These complex algorithms sometimes rely on data that are harvested from consumer surveillance or data not typically found in a consumer’s credit file or credit application. The CFPB has underscored the harm that can result from consumer surveillance and the risk to consumers that these data may pose. Some of these data may not intuitively relate to the likelihood that a consumer will repay a loan. The CFPB and the prudential regulators have previously noted that these data may create additional consumer protection risk.10 This Circular addresses adverse action notice requirements under ECOA and Regulation B; financial institutions also must ensure their use of data and advanced technologies fully complies with other legal requirements, such as the prohibition against illegal discrimination. The CFPB, along with the Department of Justice and other enforcement agencies, have pledged to vigorously use the agencies’ collective authorities to protect individuals’ rights regardless of whether legal violations occur through traditional means or advanced technologies.11

Under ECOA and Regulation B a creditor must provide an applicant with a statement of specific reason(s) for an adverse action; these reasons must “relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.”12 A creditor therefore may not rely solely on the unmodified checklist of reasons in the sample forms provided by the CFPB if the reasons provided on the sample forms do not reflect the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. As explained in Regulation B, “[i]f the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed.”13 Rather, the sample forms merely provide an illustrative and non-exclusive list.14 Thus, if the principal reason(s) a creditor actually relies on is not accurately reflected in the checklist of reasons in the sample forms, it is the duty of the creditor—if it chooses to use the sample forms—to either modify the form or check “other” and include the appropriate explanation, so that the applicant against whom adverse action is taken receives a statement of reasons that is specific and indicates the principal reason(s) for the action taken. Creditors that simply select the closest, but nevertheless inaccurate, identifiable factors from the checklist of sample reasons are not in compliance with the law. Creditors may not evade this requirement, even if the factors actually considered or scored by the creditor may be surprising to consumers, as may be the case when a creditor relies on complex algorithms that, for instance, consider data that are not typically found in a consumer’s credit file or credit application.

Because it is unlawful for a creditor to fail to provide a statement of specific reasons for the action taken,15 a creditor will not be in compliance with the law by disclosing reasons that are overly broad, vague, or otherwise fail to inform the applicant of the specific and principal reason(s) for an adverse action. Just as an accurate description of the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor is critical to ensuring compliant adverse action notifications, sufficient specificity is also required. Such specificity is necessary to ensure consumer understanding is not hindered by explanations that obfuscate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action taken. For instance, Regulation B provides the example that a creditor should disclose “insufficient bank references” and not “insufficient credit references,” which is listed on the CFPB’s sample form, if the creditor considers only references from banks and other depository institutions and not from other institutions.16

Specificity is particularly important when creditors utilize complex algorithms. Consumers may not anticipate that certain data gathered outside of their application or credit file and fed into an algorithmic decision-making model may be a principal reason in a credit decision, particularly if the data are not intuitively related to their finances or financial capacity. As noted in the Official Commentary to Regulation B, a creditor must “disclose the actual reasons for denial . . . even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.”17 For instance, if a complex algorithm results in a denial of a credit application due to an applicant’s chosen profession, a statement that the applicant had “insufficient projected income” or “income insufficient for amount of credit requested” would likely fail to meet the creditor’s legal obligations. Even if the creditor believed that the reason for the adverse action was broadly related to future income or earning potential, providing such a reason likely would not satisfy its duty to provide the specific reason(s) for adverse action. Concerns regarding specificity may also arise when creditors take adverse action against consumers with existing credit lines. For example, if a creditor decides to lower the limit on, or close altogether, a consumer’s credit line based on behavioral data, such as the type of establishment at which a consumer shops or the type of goods purchased, it would likely be insufficient for the creditor to simply state “purchasing history” or “disfavored business patronage” as the principal reason for adverse action.18 Instead, the creditor would likely need to disclose more specific details about the consumer’s purchasing history or patronage that led to the reduction or closure, such as the type of establishment, the location of the business, the type of goods purchased, or other relevant considerations, as appropriate.19

As discussed in an Advisory Opinion, these requirements under ECOA extend to adverse actions taken in connection with existing credit accounts (i.e., an account termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor’s accounts20), as well as new applications for credit.21 The CFPB has also made clear that adverse action notice requirements apply equally to all credit decisions, regardless of whether the technology used to make them involves complex or “black-box” algorithmic models, or other technology that creditors may not understand sufficiently to meet their legal obligations.22 As data use and credit models continue to evolve, creditors have an obligation to ensure that these models comply with existing consumer protection laws.

Like ECOA, FCRA also includes adverse action notification requirements. See 15 U.S.C. 1681m(a)(2). For example, when a person takes adverse action based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report and has used a credit score, the person must disclose the credit score and, among other items, the “key factors that adversely affected the score of the consumer,” the total of which shall generally not exceed four (except if a key factor was the number of inquiries made with respect to a consumer report). 15 U.S.C. 1681g(f)(1)(C), 1681m(a)(2). Although this Circular is focused on ECOA’s adverse action notification requirements, similar principles apply under FCRA when a person must disclose the “key factors that adversely affected the credit score of the consumer.” 15 U.S.C. 1681g(f)(1)(C); see also 1681g(f)(2)(B) (defining “key factors” to mean “all relevant elements or reasons adversely affecting the credit score of the particular individual, listed in the order of their importance based on their effect on the credit score”). Despite similar underlying principles, the statutory obligations under FCRA and ECOA are distinct. See 12 CFR Part 1002 (Supp. I), sec. 1002.9, para. 9(b)(2)-9 (“Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer’s credit score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application or extension of credit.”). Moreover, while ECOA’s requirements only apply to creditors, FCRA’s adverse action notice requirements apply to “any person” that takes adverse action based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer report, including employers, landlords, insurers, and other users of consumer reports. 15 U.S.C. 1681m(a). This Circular focuses on ECOA’s adverse action notification requirements and does not address requirements under FCRA.

Today we fined Wells Fargo Bank $100 million for widespread unlawful sales practices. The Bank’s employees secretly opened accounts and shifted funds from consumers’ existing accounts into these new accounts without their knowledge or permission to do so, often racking up fees or other charges.

""Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses. Because of the severity of these violations, Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed. Today’s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences.""

&mdash; CFPB Director Richard Cordray

The Bank had compensation programs for its employees that encouraged them to sign up existing clients for deposit accounts, credit cards, debit cards, and online banking. According to today’s enforcement action, thousands of Wells Fargo employees illegally enrolled consumers in these products and services without their knowledge or consent in order to obtain financial compensation for meeting sales targets.

Bank employees temporarily funded newly-opened accounts by transferring funds from consumers’ existing accounts in order to obtain financial compensation for meeting sales targets. These illegal sales practices date back at least five years and include using consumer names and personal information to create hundreds of thousands of unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts.

The law prohibits these types of unfair and abusive practices.

Violations covered in today’s CFPB order include:

Opening deposit accounts and transferring funds without authorization, sometimes resulting in insufficient funds fees.
Applying for credit-card accounts without consumers’ knowledge or consent, leading to annual fees, as well as associated finance or interest charges and other late fees for some consumers.
Issuing and activating debit cards, going so far as to create PINs, without consent.
Creating phony email addresses to enroll consumers in online-banking services.
Enforcement Action

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we have the authority to take action against institutions that violate consumer financial laws. Today’s order goes back to Jan. 1, 2011. Among the things the CFPB’s order requires of Wells Fargo:

Pay full refunds to consumers.
Ensure proper sales practices.
Pay a $100 million fine.

Today’s penalty is the largest we have imposed. Other offices or agencies are also taking actions requiring Wells Fargo to pay an additional $85 million in penalties.

To read more about the details surrounding this enforcement action, read our press release.

Next steps for consumers

If you were one of the thousands of people who incurred fees as a result of an unauthorized Wells Fargo account, the CFPB has ordered Wells Fargo to refund all of your money. Some payments have already been made; others will be sent in the coming months. You can read our blog on what you need to know if you were harmed by these actions.

It is always a good idea to review your account statements to look for unauthorized accounts or activity. If you find something that seems wrong, contact the company. If you’re still having an issue, you can submit a complaint to us online or by calling us at (855) 411-2372.

It is also a good idea to periodically review your credit report for unusual activity. Get a free copy of your credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com . You can receive a free credit report from each nationwide credit reporting company once every 12 months.

debt-free strategy mindset shifts effectiveness,investopedia,How to Talk About Money with Your Partner,"Learning how to talk about money with your partner can help you manage conflict, create more meaningful financial goals, and build trust. Here’s what you need to know.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-partner-8612447,"Having open conversations about finances is essential for any healthy romantic relationship. But no matter how long you’ve been lovebirds, bringing up money can feel awkward and uncomfortable.

A February 2023 study by Bread Financial found that baby boomers tend to discuss finances with their partners the least of any generation—only 13% of those surveyed admitted to talking about finances daily. Millennials were a different story; 39% claimed to discuss money daily with their partners. Yet, the study also found that “58% of millennials and 57% of Gen Z’ers report arguments with their partner over finances at least occasionally, whereas only 30% of boomers do the same.”1 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Open communication about money is crucial for a healthy relationship.
Building trust about money matters and setting shared financial goals can strengthen your relationship.
Approach the conversation about money with empathy and understanding.
Create financial transparency by discussing income, expenses, and budgeting.

Not all money conversations are good ones, and there is such a thing as talking about the topic too much. Rather than prioritize frequency, it is best to focus on quality.

Certified financial planner R.J. Weiss says one of the easiest ways to start is to “Concentrate on future goals instead of past spending habits. Start with a question like, ‘What do we want our finances to look like in three years?’” This kind of open-ended question avoids finger pointing and provides a neutral starting point to discuss how each of you values money.

Regular and healthy talks about money can help you and your partner unpack financial fears and money scripts, as well as plan for financial independence and shared milestones.

Talking About Money Matters

A recent Forbes Advisor survey of 1,000 divorcees found that their number one reason for getting married was financial security (42%). Although finances didn’t top the reasons why they divorced, money matters played a significant role in common conflicts among couples who wound up divorcing. Forty-six percent reported career choices as the most prevalent topic of disagreement, while 43% said the division of household labor, and 28% named finances.2

If not addressed proactively, money issues like conflicting spending habits, opposing views on saving and investing, and dead-end jobs can breed resentment over time. Keeping lines of communication open within couples is essential to the overall solvency of a committed relationship, but it is just the first step. Discussing spending priorities, savings goals, and debt management can help you find compromises and solutions as a team.

Next, you may need to have financial conversations with children, aging parents, ex-spouses, co-parents, business partners, and anyone else who relies on your household income. Setting priorities within your partnership can help you speak with one voice when discussing boundaries with dependents.

Establish a Foundation of Trust

Many people were raised to believe that talking about money is rude or taboo. Raising the topic of money before your relationship is on solid emotional ground can feel like a recipe for disaster.

Yet, early transparency around money can help you determine if this partnership is going to work in the long term. It is less about how much money is in each bank account and more about whether you both see eye to eye about how you spend, save, and value money.

Starting these conversations from a nonjudgmental place helps both partners feel safe to reveal the emotions behind their money habits and to shift to more sustainable patterns in the future.

Weiss says it’s best to make financial discussions a regular part of your relationship routine, at least monthly. This normalizes conversations—rather than arguments—about money. You can use a common monthly billing cycle as the anchor to review your numbers. If you want to dig deeper into concepts, you can agree to read a personal finance book or listen to a money-focused podcast and discuss it monthly.

These periodic check-ins are opportunities to disclose money woes and craft strategies together. There are also times to acknowledge wins like promotions, investment growth, and debt paydown. Knowing your partner can handle the good and the bad is really what healthy relationships are made of.

However, you must expect that these conversations are going to be emotional. Try not to lash out in fear or anger when gathering new information about your partner’s money hygiene. Also, don’t beat yourself up about any slip-ups throughout the month. Listen with empathy and devise a plan to set things right. The intention is to build a culture of accountability and discipline, not one of extreme austerity or shame.

It may take time and care, but openly sharing money experiences without blame ultimately builds trust and strengthens intimacy.

Get Excited About Shared Financial Goals

The best part of sharing a life with someone is the prospect of doing what you love with someone you love.

Chances are, shared interests are what brought you and your partner together in the first place. Hone in on the meaningful life events and accomplishments you’d like to share with each other, and build conversations around the part each of you will play in ensuring that those milestones come to pass.

Once you get past the initial awkwardness, setting shared money goals can be incredibly bonding.

“Couples should set goals both individually and together and should understand what each of them is trying to accomplish and work towards,” says Lawrence D. Sprung, a wealth advisor and the host of the Mitlin Money Mindset podcast. “Although income and salaries may be different, as long as your goals are aligned, the combined incomes should be viewed as being available towards both your individual goals [and your goals] as a couple.”

Talking about money with your partner ensures that you both have a solid game plan to advance your lives as a couple.

Use These Tips to Talk to Your Partner About Money


Choosing the right time and place for money discussions ensures a nonconfrontational and supportive environment to tackle what could be a sensitive topic for you or your partner. These are effective strategies for initiating a conversation about money with your partner:

Work Through the Details

At first glance, figuring out the nitty-gritty of budgeting and expenses together can feel really overwhelming.

To make combining your finances more manageable, both partners have to be honest about their incomes, debts, and other financial obligations. Excessive privacy or vagueness breeds mistrust. Trust that you can share the details with your partner and that they won’t judge you but instead serve as a supportive sounding board.

Married couples can file their U.S. taxes jointly or separately. While filing jointly is most common, filing separately can be advantageous if there are large differences in medical bills, debts, and income between partners. The details matter.

Discuss Debt

“The important thing here is to have an honest and transparent conversation about your respective debt,” Sprung says. “Put it all on the table and begin to have a conversation about who is going to take care of the debt, one of you or both, and put a plan together to start extinguishing it immediately so you can start off on a clean slate as a couple.”

Couples approach debt in various ways. Some combine finances and include premarital debt in their joint financial goals, while others choose not to work together to pay off individual debt.

“Another approach I’ve seen work is to split debt repayment based on each partner’s income level,” Weiss says. “This method makes a lot of sense when the partner with higher debt, often due to student loans, also has a higher income.”

If either of you is carrying debt from a prior relationship, expect that these discussions might be more heated than those related to the debt you accumulate together. Rely on the foundation of trust to create a plan that you both can commit to.

Use Technology

Gone are the days of spreadsheets and shoe boxes full of receipts. Instead, you can use trackers on your credit and bank cards to closely monitor spending. If you share cards, all the transactions will be visible and accessible to discuss at your monthly money meeting. If you want to combine your finances, try apps that combine bank accounts and track spending as you swipe. 

The budgeting app Mint switched to Credit Karma in 2024 and no longer offers the same budgeting features. However, it will keep past data around net worth and add new finance trackers.3 The EveryDollar app and YNAB (You Need a Budget) are paid alternatives.

To curb frivolous spending or celebrate debt paydown, you can agree to set spending alerts on your accounts. Establish autopay to avoid any penalties or late fees. Don’t rely solely on memory and willpower to reach your collective goals, especially long-term ones like retiring, buying a house, or paying off student loans and consumer debt.

Swap ‘Shoulds’ for ‘Coulds’

Personal finance conversations are often laden with regret, no matter how much or how little money a person has. Hindsight is 20/20, and most people recognize that they could have made smarter money decisions at some point.

Rather than focus on what you or your partner should have done in the past, focus on the future. Consider what you could do now and which strategies resonate most with your financial goals. When talking about money, trade past-oriented shoulds with forward-thinking coulds.

For example, instead of criticizing yourself (or your partner) for not sticking to the budget last month, focus on adjustments that will help you stay on track next month. Keep a positive and hopeful attitude when addressing household finances.

Don’t Wait

It is easy to put off money conversations, but don’t wait too long. It’s better to have early and regular communication about finances in flux than to wait for a perfect moment that isn’t likely to come.

There will always be a payment that hasn’t cleared or an account issue to troubleshoot. That’s the very purpose of having these conversations regularly. Together, you can build solid money habits within your partnership and share oversight of your financial life.

Make It an Occasion

“Make these conversations something you look forward to. I’ve seen couples order takeout from one of their favorite restaurants, get dressed up, or open a bottle of wine,” Weiss says.

These money chats on a date night can be great for confirming if your timeline for the future will match up with the growth of your savings and investment accounts. They can also mark money wins for one or both of you. And these enjoyable settings can mute the blow of financial setbacks.

However, these occasions aren’t ideal for crunching numbers or tackling highly sensitive points of contention. In both cases, you should work with a professional. Accountants, couples counselors, and even tax preparers should be consulted in their offices or in a quiet, private setting where you can get the most value from their expertise.

Seek Outside Help When Needed

Sometimes, you and your partner might feel stuck on money issues even after repeated constructive attempts to work through things together. To get unstuck, consider getting unbiased guidance from a financial professional. Certified experts are required to stay abreast of the latest trends, tools, and tactics to make the most of any situation.

If talks consistently get heated and communication breaks down, try couples counseling to have a neutral party on hand to moderate difficult conversations. A therapist can help reveal the root issues driving money conflicts and provide tools to discuss finances in a healthy manner.

Meeting with a couples financial advisor can offer an impartial outside perspective. An expert can assess your complete financial picture collaboratively and map out customized strategies to help you gain clarity on financial decisions or overcome hurdles.

Other professionals you should seek include career counselors, headhunters, investment advisors, bank account managers, and more.

How Can I Start the Money Talk without Causing a Fight?

Don’t spring it on your spouse or partner suddenly, and don’t come on too strong. Ease into it by mentioning that you’d like to set aside time to casually discuss your hopes and goals related to money. Pick a relaxed day without distractions. Frame it as a chance to dream together, not point fingers.

What Are Some Usual Challenges That Couples Have with Money?

Some of the most common money issues between couples include fears about the economy, saving vs. spending, and how to communicate about money, according to an Orion survey. Nearly half of couples surveyed said that they considered dishonesty about money a form of infidelity.4

How Can Shared Goals Help?

Having a common vision to work toward builds unity and teamwork. It motivates you to compromise or make sacrifices for each other’s benefit. Having a singular and shared goal can also highlight your money strengths and weaknesses. Together, you can improve habits that will sustain your relationship.

Are There Resources for Managing Money as a Couple?

Yes. Try apps like Honeydue or Zeta. They help couples budget and track finances together. Sites like CoupleWise offer courses and tips. Or meet with a financial advisor or counselor for personalized guidance.

When Should We Seek Outside Help with Money Issues?

If you constantly argue about the same topics, don’t struggle alone. Seek counseling or financial help. Money is a top cause of relationship problems, but professionals can help.

What Are Financial Red Flags in a Partner That I Shouldn’t Ignore?

Secrecy about money, uncontrolled spending, reckless gambling or investing, avoiding paying debts, and repeated unwillingness to discuss finances openly can be problematic. Use caution if these are ongoing concerns.

The Bottom Line

Transparent communication is crucial for a healthy relationship, money talks included.

Start with trust and empathy. These early discussions can focus on establishing a baseline of understanding about how your individual money scripts need to change if you’re going to share a future. Raising financial matters with your partner isn’t just about discussing debt. You also need to set shared financial goals, discuss career and income changes, and adjust budgets to suit your needs.

Since financial plans change over a lifetime, expect that the discussion will always continue. Pace yourself. If some topics are heavier than others, give it time and patience before revisiting intractable issues with the help of experts. Whether you combine finances or keep them separate, neither partner should be kept in the dark. Financial transparency is a pillar of a successful relationship.

But by keeping our finances under wraps from friends, we may be missing out on valuable advice, deeper relationships, and new perspectives.

“Having a friend or a group of friends that you can talk to about money can radically shift your relationship with it,” says Grant Sabatier, author of Financial Freedom and creator of Millennial Money. “The more you think about money and talk about money, the more comfortable that you get with it.”

Here are some helpful tips on how to start the conversation, set boundaries, and help one another toward financial independence.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Discussing money with friends can help you build stronger relationships and foster financial well-being.
Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is crucial for open and honest money conversations.
Starting the conversation with interesting and indirect questions can help break the ice and encourage participation.
Setting boundaries and expectations can prevent conflicts and ensure productive discussions.
Seeking educational resources and working with financial advisors and financial therapists can enhance your financial journey.
How to Start the Conversation

Before deciding what you want to talk about, you will want to determine who you want to talk with.

Casually incorporating personal finance topics into your conversations with friends can help you figure out which friends share your financial values and what tone you want the conversation to have. Here are some questions to open the conversation without getting into the nitty-gritty:

Are you more of a spender or a saver?
What’s more worth it: an experience or an item?
Can money buy happiness?

For me and many of my college-aged friends, investing in a Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), opening a high-yield savings account, or amassing a strong credit score are points of pride. As Sabatier suggests, speaking with friends in similar financial situations to your own helps you relate to one another without a sense of competition.

“Talking with people who were in the exact same situation as me about money was very, very effective,” Sabatier says. “It’s being on a life journey with someone else who’s where you’re at.”

How to Create a Judgment-Free Environment

Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is key to having constructive conversations and building relationships with your friends. Here are some tips for setting the tone and building trust.

Set Ground Rules 

Before you jump into a conversation, some financial experts advise setting ground rules and objectives. Here are some sample rules that I have used with my friends:

Keep the conversation confidential
Speak using “I” statements
Actively listen without interrupting
Do not pass judgment
Avoid comparisons

This step may feel overly formal, but it can help define the conversation’s terms and avoid later discomfort.

Lead by Example

Sabatier says that by embodying the tone that you want the conversation to take, your friends will be able to pick up on your language and demeanor to support a constructive conversation.

Especially if you’re initiating the conversation, you may need to demonstrate to your friends that an easy and comfortable money chat is achievable in the first place. Imagine if one of your friends approached you to discuss personal finance, and they immediately began passing judgments on your expenses, insisting that you use the same budget tracker that they do, or complaining about their own financial situation (which you know is more stable than your own). That would be horrible!

Modeling practices can help you avoid these situations and lay a foundation for success.

Adopt a Growth Mindset

You have a whole financial future ahead of you, and nothing is set in stone. Your financial situation will likely ebb and flow throughout your life, and centering growth and positivity in conversations with friends can improve your mindset and help you cultivate stronger financial relationships with your friends.

According to Kristin Wong, author of Get Money, a financial freedom guide for young people, confiding in friends about financial situations can be very helpful and reassuring.

“It can be really hard not to internalize our money challenges and see them as personal shortcomings,” Wong says. “Talking about those issues openly with a friend can make you feel a little less alone. Most of us have been there, and there’s a good chance your friends have, too.”

Set Boundaries and Expectations

The greatest risk when discussing money with friends is that the conversation becomes uncomfortable, and it jeopardizes your friendship. According to Sabatier and Wong, setting expectations and boundaries for money conversations can stop this problem at the root.

Personally, my precise account balances are off-limits to friends. Some of my friends are uncomfortable speaking about their financial support from their parents, and other friends choose not to talk about their college financial aid packages.

We each have different preferences, and being upfront about them can benefit your relationships in the long run.

“You can still have a candid conversation about money without sharing the nitty-gritty details of your financial life,” Wong says. “If you’re talking to the right person, you should feel comfortable setting boundaries on specific details, like your income or debt amounts, to maintain privacy and prevent any potential discomfort.”

If you do run into issues with navigating sensitive topics, it’s best to tackle any miscommunication or discomfort head-on. Some conflicts may represent a flaw in your approach to financial conversations with friends, and they could be signs to reevaluate boundaries or limits on advice.

Set Financial Goals Together

Setting financial goals with your friends can keep you motivated and improve your financial literacy. According to Wong, by sharing financial successes and failures, you can better evaluate your financial strategies.

“Friends in the same age group often face similar financial challenges: student loans, entry-level salaries, budget constraints, and so on,” Wong says. “Most young adults have a shared understanding of what it is to struggle financially, so you can create a community that fosters financial literacy and cheers each other on when it comes to financial goals.”

Address Differences in Financial Situations

When you’re in college, you and your friends all live in the same dorms and eat the same dining hall food, but when you’re in the real world, financial disparities between you and your friends will probably become more obvious—especially as you embark on different career paths.

It’s certainly not impossible to navigate money conversations with friends in different financial situations, especially if you share the same values. However, you should address financial differences head-on and approach these conversations intentionally, to prevent feelings of pity or resentment.

“You really have to come to it from a place of love, and respect, and understanding. Try to put yourself in the person’s shoes that you’re talking with, and recognize how you talk about money will make them feel,” Sabatier says. “If you have more money than them, often talking with someone who doesn’t have as much money can come off as bragging or make them feel bad because they’re not in this similar position.”

Seek Professional Help If Needed

While speaking about money with friends can be very helpful, these relationships have their limits, and you may want or need additional support from a financial advisor or educational source.

“You can get valuable insight from friends while also seeking help from a professional,” Wong says. “It’s like going to a therapist, right? A good therapist is going to help you process whatever you’re going through, but your friends can be there for you, too.”

Here are some helpful resources for finding a financial planner:

National Association of Personal Financial Advisors
CFP Board
XY Planning Network

Of course, hiring a financial advisor may not be financially realistic for many young people. According to Wong, older friends or colleagues can be helpful resources. You can also look into robo-advisor programs, which can help you manage your money for much less than a traditional financial advisor.

As Sabatier notes, a financial advisor can be very helpful, but you should always try to do your own research before seeking out a professional.

“​​Unfortunately, the financial industry is so predatory, and it’s really built around exploiting people and exploiting what they don’t know,” Sabatier says. “So if you know a little bit, you’re not gonna get scammed or the likelihood is gonna be a lot less, and you’re gonna be able to ask better questions for yourself.”

How Do You Start a Conversation Asking for Money?

Asking for money can be hard and often embarrassing. If you want to ask a friend or family member, it is important to approach the matter seriously, being direct and honest. You should explain why you need the money, provide a clear timeline for repayment, and thank the person for hearing you out.

Still, some experts in financial planning for young adults warn against lending or borrowing from friends and family.

“I think it’s probably best to avoid co-signing or lending money to friends because it has the potential to ruin friendships, and our friendships are more important than money,” Wong says.

Can a Friend or Family Member Help Me with Bill Paying and Banking?

You can ask a friend or family member to help you with bill paying and banking, but you should know that this move could come with uncomfortable consequences or power imbalances in your personal relationships.

If you have already decided that you want to ask a friend or family member for help with bill paying and banking, you have both formal and informal options.

Informal loans could involve your close friend cutting you a check with an informal agreement that you will pay the money back in a set amount of time.

More formal options could include a convenience account that allows you to designate a person to help you with depositing, withdrawing, and writing checks. Alternatively, adding a friend or family member to your account as a trusted contact would notify that person if your bank suspects a financial scam, and granting a person close to you power of attorney would give them the ability to act on your behalf regarding your finances.


Who Is the Best Person to Talk to About Finances?

While there is no “best” person to talk to about finances, some financial experts say that you may find it helpful to consult your friends and family about personal finance questions. Given that these people are deeply familiar with your values and character, they may be able to provide you with more candid and personalized advice than a financial advisor or therapist.

Regardless of who you talk to about your personal finances, you should make an effort to educate yourself on different financial products and services before entering into a conversation. Resources like Investopedia’s Financial Literacy Resource Center, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Endowment for Financial Education provide foundational finance knowledge, so you can know your options and control your money.

The Bottom Line

Friends can be a great resource for personal finance matters. However, it’s essential to recognize the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations when engaging in financial discussions with friends. By openly communicating personal preferences and boundaries, you can foster healthier relationships and avoid potential discomfort or misunderstandings.

Beyond friends, you may want to seek professional guidance from financial advisors and external financial education resources. Ultimately, by navigating financial discussions with friends sensitively, you can strengthen your friendships while enhancing your financial well-being."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,4 Easy Budgeting Techniques,"To create and stick to a budget, it’s helpful to have some tricks up your sleeve. Here are some easy tactics to keep you on track.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112116/four-easy-budgeting-techniques-you-should-master.asp,"For some people, budgeting money comes naturally; they like being organized and tracking data. For others, it’s a bit more challenging. Facts and figures aren’t their forte and constant monitoring is tedious. Even if you fall into the latter category, the process can be made easier with a few quick tricks.

Here are four easy techniques that will make budget planning a breeze.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Dump the receipts. Use an app to track your expenses.
Automate your bill-paying and monthly savings.
Be flexible, but if you constantly bust your budget revise it.
1. Automate Your Tracking

There's no real reason these days to save your receipts in a pile and wade through them later. There are apps for that.

A smartphone app or software program can help you track your budget. These programs often use the same security systems that online banks do, so if you choose a reputable tracker, you should not be concerned with the safety of your information.

The programs will not only track your spending but will help you categorize your purchases, send you alerts when you are nearing your budget limits, and help you set long-term financial goals and keep to them.

2. Automate Your Spending

Automatic bill payment and automatic transfers of money into a checking account can take some of the difficulty out of sticking to a budget.

After all, if you never see the money in your checking account you won’t spend it on things that are not in your budget. Just be sure to keep enough funds in the account to cover your automated expenses so that you aren’t hit with overdraft fees. 

Coordinate Deposits and Withdrawals

One way to avoid this risk is to set all automatic withdrawals to hit at the same time that your paycheck is deposited so that your money goes directly toward the bills and your savings goals at a time that you know you will have sufficient funds in your account.

Some employers will even direct deposit a designated amount into a savings account each pay period while putting the balance into your checking account.

3. Be Flexible

Your budget has to be flexible enough to absorb some of life's nasty little surprises. Inevitably, unforeseen expenses will come up and bust your budget.

It's important to recognize that a budget is a tool that can be adjusted if it isn’t aligning with your spending.

If you go over budget a few times, don’t beat yourself up. Instead, plan for a slightly larger emergency fund as a cushion. If you continually go over, it’s time to reassess your spending. You're paying out more than you can afford and you need to make some adjustments.

4. Consider Your Future

Most people understand the difference between wants and needs when it comes to budgeting. However, many people incorrectly place savings in the optional spending category.

The Bottom Line

Planning for your retirement, building an emergency fund, and saving for long-term goals are all critical for your financial health. They should not be considered optional expenses that can be eliminated when they're inconvenient.

Even if it means forgoing dinner out or cutting the cable bill, saving money needs to be a mandatory part of your budget. You want to be financially prepared to meet your long-term goals, whether you want to buy a house, travel the world, or pay off debts."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,How to Start a Family and Save for Retirement,"To start a family and save for retirement, you’ll need to plan ahead and take advantage of cost reduction strategies, tax benefits, and budgeting techniques.",https://www.investopedia.com/family-and-retirement-8599280,"Starting a family while saving for retirement comes with challenges and benefits. In most cases, time is on your side.

If you start early, you still have plenty of time to grow your retirement savings and benefit from compound interest. And there are a number of tax-advantaged plans out there to help you do so without incurring a huge tax bill.

On the other hand, starting relatively young means you may still be building your career and income. According to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2023” report, the average retirement savings account balance for ages 35–44 is $76,354. For ages 25–34, that number is just $30,017. On top of that, there’s buying a home, a car, and paying for your children’s college and weddings to account for.1

The good news is that with the right tools and strategies, planning for both your family’s needs and your retirement is entirely possible.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Plan ahead and start saving early to balance starting a family with building a successful retirement plan.
Understand common costs for individuals and couples who want to raise children while saving for retirement.
Assess your financial situation, set goals as a family, and create a budget to meet those goals.
Take advantage of cost reduction strategies and tax benefits available to families.
Use tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for retirement.
Costs to Consider

In general, the stereotypical American Dream is becoming more expensive. Take the average cost of raising two children until age 18, estimated at $576,896. The average amount needed to retire is even higher, clocking in at $715,968, according to Investopedia’s recent analysis.

Understanding the various costs you may face is the first step to preparing for them. Couples or individuals who are starting a family should consider the following.

Having a Baby or Adopting

If you’re enrolled in a large group plan, out-of-pocket costs for a hospital birth average $2,854 per child.2 When it comes to adoption, costs vary widely depending on whether you adopt via the public child welfare system, a private agency, independent adoption, or intercountry adoption.

According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adoption from a private agency may cost $30,000 to $60,000.3

Independent or intercountry adoption ranges from $20,000 to $50,000, whereas adopting a child from the welfare system is virtually free. The associated expenses may include home study, court and legal fees, and social work or counseling services.4

Paying for Child Care

Child care has long been a substantial expense for families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deems child care as “affordable” when it costs no more than 7% of a family’s household income.5 Yet many families spend 10% to 24% of household income on child care.6

Child care costs vary by state. For example, the average cost of infant care in Alabama is around $500 per month and $432 each month for a 4-year-old. In California, the average monthly cost of infant care is $1,412, and $956 for a 4-year-old. And in Michigan, you’d pay an average of $905 per month for infant care or $741 per month for a 4-year-old.7

Saving for Higher Education

Putting your kids through college is a major cost, no matter how you slice it. For academic year 2021–22, the average total cost for full-time undergraduate attendance was $32,900 at a private for-profit institution and $55,800 at a private nonprofit institution. Meanwhile, public institutions had an average total cost of $26,000.8

These amounts represent the sum of tuition and required fees, books, supplies, and the average cost of room and board for students living on campus at four-year institutions.

Keep in mind that this amount doesn’t reflect the various types of financial aid that students may receive.

Assess Your Financial Situation

Evaluating your current financial situation is a crucial step toward reaching your personal financial goals. A thorough assessment of your income, expenses, and savings potential will provide valuable insights into your overall financial health and areas for improvement.

Here are key aspects to consider when assessing your finances:

Income

Calculate your gross annual income by adding up all sources of earnings, such as wages, salaries, self-employment profits, interest, dividends, and rental income. Be sure to account for any changes in employment status, promotions, or new job opportunities throughout the year.

Expenses

Create a detailed list of all ongoing and ad hoc expenses, categorizing them accordingly. Common categories include housing, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, healthcare, debt payments, entertainment, subscriptions, and miscellaneous expenses.

To get a clear picture of your spending habits, track your expenses over several months by using budgeting tools like spreadsheets, mobile apps, or online resources provided by banks and credit unions.

Savings Potential

Determine your disposable income by calculating the amount left from your income after paying taxes and necessary expenses. Then, evaluate whether you have enough funds available for emergency savings, retirement planning, investments, and discretionary spending.

Establish Family Priorities

With an understanding of the costs involved and a clear picture of your financial situation, you can begin to prioritize and outline future goals—both for your family and your retirement. Specific goals will depend on you, your partner, and your financial situation. But the following are a good place to start:

Start or Grow Your Emergency Fund 

If an unexpected car repair, pet expense, or medical emergency suddenly popped up, would you have enough cash to cover it? What if you got laid off next month?

If you aren’t prepared, an unexpected expense could derail your savings plans. That's why financial experts always recommend having an emergency fund to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses.9 If you’re self-employed or your income is unpredictable, you’ll want to save even more.

Having a safety net set aside keeps you from having to use credit cards or dipping into your retirement savings. The best place for an emergency fund is a liquid and thus easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings or other interest-earning account.


Put Retirement First

When setting financial goals, it’s natural for parents to want to put their children first. But financial planners recommend prioritizing your own retirement over saving for a child’s education.

While students have access to loans, grants, and scholarships, there are no such resources for parents. Saving for retirement falls largely on the individual—with some help from your employer if you’re lucky.

So, contribute as much as you can to your retirement savings accounts, and take advantage of any 401(k) or Health Savings Account (HSA) matching programs that your company offers.

Plan Ahead for Education Savings 

Once you hit your retirement savings goals, the next step is saving for your kids’ college tuition. A 529 plan is a great way to do this, since it’s specifically designed to help pay for higher education.

This tax-advantaged account allows contributions to grow federal income tax-deferred, with tax-free withdrawals for qualified higher education expenses (such as tuition and room and board).10

Establish Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Goals for Your Family 

For families who may feel overwhelmed by competing financial goals—like buying a home, saving for a child's education, or retirement—Mike Kojonen, founder of Principal Preservation Services, recommends setting goal milestones.

“For example, rather than seeing retirement as a distant, abstract aim, break it down into actionable steps like increasing retirement contributions annually or setting up a dedicated college savings fund for their children,” he says.

These targets can be broken down into specific short-, medium-, and long-term financial objectives for your family. For instance, building an emergency fund, contributing to employer-matched retirement plans, and establishing a consistent saving habit might serve as short-term goals.

Long-term goals often include caring for aging parents or, if your children are young, saving for their college education. Medium-term goals (say, five years) could include a family vacation, buying a new car, or remodeling your home.

Consider having a conversation with family members or a financial advisor to help outline these priorities and get on the same page.

Mark Damsgaard, head of client advisory at Global Residence Index, also recommends that couples discuss whether they’ll keep some assets separate or share all assets.

“It’s not wrong to not share the entirety of your assets, especially if you worked hard for them on your own. And then you may talk about having joint accounts for the earnings and assets you acquire when you enter your marriage or partnership,” Damsgaard says.


Revisit Your Budget

Achieving financial goals is often easier when you have a budget to give structure and clarity to your spending habits. A budget works best when it’s based on the specifics of your situation.

Use what you’ve learned about known costs for major goals like family and retirement, your financial situation, and your long- and short-term goals to set a realistic budget. Compare the following common budgeting models to see what works best for you.

50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% of income to needs (such as housing, food, and utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, and hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment (including retirement savings). While it may not work for everyone, this rule is popular because of its simplicity.

Progressive Budgeting

With progressive budgeting, you gradually increase savings and retirement contributions as your income grows or your family’s financial situation improves. Progressive budgeting is particularly useful in working against lifestyle creep, a common phenomenon that can eat into your retirement and family savings if you aren’t careful.

Pay Yourself First

Pay yourself first is exactly what it sounds like. You set aside money from your income for debt payments and savings, including retirement contributions, before taking care of other bills.

Of course, you still need to account for rent and other ongoing expenses. But this method, sometimes called reverse budgeting, makes it easy to prioritize savings goals. For example, you could set up automatic transfers or contributions to retirement accounts before allocating money for other uses.


Tips for Balancing Saving for a Family and Retirement

Reducing costs and maximizing tax benefits mean more money that you can put toward retirement or family goals.

See Where You Can Reduce Costs 

Lowering your child care bill can amount to major savings. Consider enlisting help from neighbors and family members or arranging child care swaps with other parents. Some states also offer government-funded assistance programs to help families pay for child care.

Government resources include Head Start and Early Head Start programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, military child care financial assistance programs, and government vouchers or subsidies. You should also see if your employer offers a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA).

To save money beyond child care costs, look into other possibilities like:

Mortgage refinancing to reduce your monthly payment
Adjusting your thermostat or using energy-efficient bulbs to save on utility bills
Carpooling, using public transportation, or walking/cycling to trim transportation costs
Cutting food costs by cooking at home, buying store brands, and planning meals ahead of time

Maximize Tax Benefits 

There are tax benefits designed to help families save money, including:

Child Tax Credit (CTC): The CTC provides a tax credit of up to $2,000 per qualifying child under the age of 17. For 2024, up to $1,700 of the tax credit may be refundable, depending on your tax situation.11
Child and Dependent Care Credit: This credit covers expenses for child care services, such as babysitting, daycare, or preschool, for children under age 13 or disabled spouses or parents. The credit ranges from 20% to 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents.12
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Low- and moderate-income working families can benefit from the EITC, which reduces the amount of tax owed and may result in a tax refund. The credit is based on a percentage of earned income, with higher income phaseouts for taxpayers with children.13
Credit for Other Dependents: This is available to taxpayers with a dependent who doesn’t qualify for the Child Tax Credit, such as children age 17 or older, qualifying relatives, or dependent parents.14
Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction: This permits self-employed parents to deduct 100% of the cost of health insurance premiums paid for family members, including children under age 27.15

Take Advantage of Retirement Savings Options

Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts to maximize savings and growth.

401(k) Plans: Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary toward retirement savings, often with employer matching contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Traditional IRAs are personal retirement accounts that provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA: SEP and SIMPLE IRAs let small business owners and self-employed individuals save for retirement while receiving tax benefits.16
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): For families or individuals with a high-deductible health plan, HSAs offer flexible options for saving money on healthcare or boosting retirement savings.17

How Much Should I Save Monthly for Retirement?

The amount you should save monthly for retirement will vary based on your income, age, and retirement goals. Financial experts recommend saving at least 10% to 15% of your income for retirement—including your employer match, if you have one. If possible, bumping that up to 20% of your income can help you save significantly more over time. This is especially helpful if you’ve started later on saving for retirement.18

What Are the Best Retirement Savings Options for Families?

You can use a number of strategies to help you save for retirement, including tax-advantaged retirement accounts like traditional or Roth 401(k)s and IRAs, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs (if you’re self-employed), HSAs, or other investment accounts. For parents who want to start putting money away for their children, custodial IRAs offer tax-advantaged savings.

The best retirement plan to build your nest egg will depend on your financial situation, your goals for retirement, and other factors. Understand the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, and tax rules surrounding accounts to help you make the best decision. You may want to consult a financial advisor.


What Is the 5% Rule for Retirement Savings?

The 5% rule is a frequently used rule of thumb for calculating how much you can withdraw from retirement savings each year without running out of money. A modified version of the traditional 4% rule, the 5% rule allows for a higher annual withdrawal rate, which may work for long-term investors with diversified portfolios.1920 Work with a financial advisor to assess whether the 5% withdrawal rate aligns with your retirement objectives, investment strategy, and overall financial plan.

The Bottom Line

Armed with knowledge about your goals, potential costs, financial situation, and available tools for investing, you can achieve a comfortable retirement while also growing a family. Start early and contribute consistently to retirement savings in order to maximize your savings and growth potential. If needed, seek professional financial advice to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning and evaluate the best decisions based on your specific situation."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,Budgeting Calculator,This free budgeting calculator shows how to divide your income between savings and spending.,https://www.investopedia.com/budgeting-calculator-5101411,"A Monthly Budgeting Calculator to Help Take Control of Your Finances

Are you struggling to keep your spending below your income? Do you strategize about how to increase your savings? Our free budgeting calculator will help you save time and avoid mistakes when you need to understand where your money is going every month.

How the Budgeting Calculator Works 

To use our free budgeting calculator, just enter your monthly income and expenses. We’ll show you what percentage of your income you’re spending (or saving) in each category and whether you’re living within or beyond your means.

The output from using the budgeting calculator shows the percentage of your income that goes toward each category. Seeing the results in pie-chart form makes it easy to tell where most of your money goes. It breaks down your total monthly income and total monthly expenses while displaying the percentages of your income that are spent in specific areas. And it shows the total monthly funds that remain after you've accounted for all those expenses. The bigger the gap, the more extra funds you may have.

Key Components of a Budget Calculation

The categories below offer a basic framework that you can use to organize your expenses and think about the amounts that might be reasonable for you in each category. Everyone’s finances are different, and this calculator is a tool to help you, so use it in the way that makes the most sense for how you think about your money. You don’t have to allocate your expenses exactly as we describe.

Start by filling in the budgeting calculator with your real expenses. If some are uneven (you buy more clothes some months than others), calculate an annual average. Take a screenshot of the results. Then see how you can improve your remaining monthly funds by adjusting expenses that are discretionary—what budget experts call ""wants."" Where are your savings opportunities?

Total Monthly Income

Make sure to use your after-tax income for the whole family here—your budget is about the money you have available to spend. This should include your income from wages and salaries, gig work or part-time jobs, bonuses, child support, alimony, tips, Social Security, distributions, settlements, and any other sources of income.

Housing

Four walls, a floor, and a roof comprise most people’s biggest expense. A common rule of thumb is to limit housing costs to 30% of your income. For many households this is a challenge: Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies considers a household “moderately cost-burdened” when housing costs 31% to 49% of income, and “severely cost-burdened” when housing takes up 50% or more of income. In 2021, about 23% of U.S. households were cost burdened.
1
 Include your rent or mortgage payment in this category as well as renter’s insurance or homeowners insurance. Homeowners will also include any maintenance fees in this category.

Electricity, natural gas, water service, trash pickup, and the like are added together and go into this category. It can be hard to make a dent in these monthly bills without significant changes to your energy use, and some of those changes require upfront investments that take a long time to pay off, such as energy-efficient light bulbs, appliances, and heating and cooling systems. Caulking and weather stripping to seal gaps around doors and windows is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to achieve savings here, even if you’re not handy and on a tight budget.

Line items like property taxes or homeowners association fees can fill in the other area, including any other housing-related costs that need to be counted.

Food

In this category, add your essential groceries for the whole family. Add in any prepared meal kits and restaurant meals. Don't forget to account for takeout deliveries.

Transportation

The average household spent $12,295 on transportation in 2022 (the most recently available data), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average income before taxes was $94,003, meaning the average person’s transportation spending takes up 11.6% of their income.
2
 In this category, you’ll include costs such as public transit, car payments, auto insurance, parking, tolls, and gasoline or fuel. If you use taxis and ride-sharing services, be sure to add those into the line item for other/miscellaneous expenses, along with any additional transportation expenses.

Education

Many people have no education expenses. Others are funding their children’s (or grandchildren’s) education or paying back student loans. There’s no rule of thumb for the percentage of your budget that should go toward schooling. Good options for keeping these costs down include creating a 529 savings plan and refinancing private student loans.

Personal and Family

If you have dependents, include expenses here that you haven’t already included in other categories. These might be costs for cellphone bills, clothes and shoes, household supplies, and vacation planning funds. Do you spend money on entertainment? Account for streaming services, museum and fitness memberships, and tickets to events in this section. Personal care (haircuts, toiletries, manicures) and pet care (vet visits, pet food, pet insurance) can also go in this category.

Debt payments outside of mortgages and student loans should go in this section. This involves adding together credit cards and personal loan payments. Add in costs such as child care, adult day care, tutoring and lessons, and charitable donations into the ""other"" section.

Healthcare

Medical, dental, and vision care insurance premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance or copays should go in this category, along with any medications (prescription and over-the-counter ones) and medical devices you use. Your premiums will be the same every month, but the other expenses can fluctuate depending on whether you get sick, need a health screening, require new glasses, or something else. Use past spending or make your best guess at your annual cost in this category, then divide by 12.

Savings and Investments

If your income allows for it, a good rule of thumb is to allocate 20% of your income to savings and investments. In addition to keeping cash in the bank for emergencies, you should funnel money into a tax-advantaged retirement account for investments. If you’ve covered those bases, you might allocate extra money to a college savings account, save for a down payment on a home, or funnel money to a taxable brokerage account in which you hold tax-free or low-tax investments, such as municipal bonds and Treasury securities. You can use the ""other"" section for any additional savings goals you might have.

Budgeting Techniques and Philosophies

Here are some helpful methods for creating a personal spending plan. Would one of these work for you?

50/30/20 Method

This method says you should aim to spend roughly 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and investments. If you live with your parents or have a paid-off mortgage, you might spend less on needs and more on wants and savings. If your housing takes up 50% of your income, you’ll have to spend less on wants and possible savings. You can adjust the percentages to suit your situation; the idea is to take a big-picture approach to your spending instead of nitpicking every category.

80/20 Method

For this method, you save and invest 20% of your income, then spend the other 80% however you want. It’s an even simpler method than the 50/30/20 method. It can work well for people who don’t have the time or desire to account for their expenses in detail. You can change the numbers to achieve your own savings goals. People who want to achieve financial independence and retire early—or those who are trying to catch up on retirement savings later in life—might use a 70/30, 60/40, or 50/50 split.

Zero-based Budgeting

A zero-based budget assigns a purpose to every last dollar of your income. When you subtract your savings and expenses from your income, the result will be zero. It’s helpful for people who prefer something more detailed than the 50/30/20 or 80/20 methods. If your income and expenses are complicated (for example, you have multiple, variable sources of income and more than 100 expenses per month), this method may be too time-consuming for you.

The Envelope System

If you use this budgeting system, you’ll allocate a specific amount of money to each budget category at the beginning of the month. When you’ve spent what you’ve allocated to a category, you’re done for the month, unless you can move money out of another category. For example, if your electric bill is $100 and you only put $80 in your literal or figurative electricity envelope, you’ll have to take $20 out of the grocery envelope (or some other envelope). 

The envelope system is a good method for people who are on a tight budget or trying to stop overspending. It originated with the idea of literally putting cash in envelopes, but you can keep your cash safely in the bank and use software or a pencil and paper instead.

It's easy to get off track if you don't follow a budget when you make one. Tech tools for budgeting can help make tracking a budget easier—even fun. Find a budgeting app or budgeting software that you find easy and helpful to use.

Benefits of Using a Budget

Budgeting adds one more thing to your to-do list, and who has time for that? You should, because the extra time and effort it takes to make a budget are worth it. For the skeptics, here are four main benefits of budgeting.

Benefit 1: Maximize your returns from working—You probably spend 20 to 50 hours a week earning money. If you’re not spending and saving consciously and carefully, you’re not getting the maximum benefit from the time you spend working. That means you’re probably going to spend even more time working and less time enjoying friends, family, hobbies, and sleep.
Benefit 2: Gain a sense of control—It’s easy to feel like expenses are happening to you, especially if money is tight. Planning your budget at the beginning of every month can make you feel like you’re choosing where your money goes. It can also help you see where you might be able to make room for saving more or paying down debt faster so that unexpected costs become less likely to set you way back.
Benefit 3: Achieve your goals—You might have a goal of traveling to Tokyo, buying a car, or becoming a one-income household instead of a two-income household. Whatever motivates you, budgeting can help you get there by helping you set financial goals and prioritize where your money is going.
Benefit 4: Spot problems before they catch you off guard—When you create a budget, you’ll be able to see clearly that only having $30 left at the end of the month to put toward your credit card bill puts you at serious risk of being unable to get out of debt or lack the money you'll need to help put your kid through school. You might not be able to solve the problem immediately, but you could start taking steps in the right direction, whether it’s learning how to improve your credit score so you can refinance your debt at a lower interest rate or researching options for a less expensive education."
snowball method debt repayment success rate,investopedia,"Debt Avalanche: Meaning, Pros and Cons, and Example",A debt avalanche is an accelerated system of paying down debt that is based on paying the loan with the highest interest rate first. Learn how to use the debt avalanche.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp,"What Is a Debt Avalanche?

A debt avalanche is a type of accelerated debt repayment plan. Essentially, a debtor allocates enough money to make the minimum payment on each source of debt, then devotes any remaining repayment funds to the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the debt avalanche approach, once the debt with the highest interest rate is entirely paid off, then the extra repayment funds go toward the next highest interest-bearing loan. This process continues until all the debts are paid off.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The debt avalanche is a systematic way of paying down debt to save money on interest.
Individuals who use the debt avalanche strategy make the minimum payment on each debt, then use any remaining available funds to pay the debt with the highest interest rates.
A debt avalanche is different from a debt snowball, which is when a borrower pays down the smallest debt first.
How Debt Avalanches Work

Paying off your debts can be a daunting task, especially when you're faced with multiple debts, high balances, and sky-high interest rates. Making only the minimum monthly payments each month can make the process seem even more overwhelming, as the majority of your payments go toward interest rather than the principal balance.

This is why it's important to have a strategy in place that will help you become debt-free. Using the debt avalanche strategy is just one possibility. This tactic allows you to concentrate on the debts with the highest rates first. You can then target the one with the second-highest rate until you're left with the one that charges the lowest rate.

The debt avalanche allows you to focus on lowering the debt you have by paying less interest over time. Here's how you should structure the strategy:

The first step in starting a debt avalanche strategy is to make a list of all the debts you owe along with the individual interest rate for each.
Next, designate an amount of your available monthly income to pay debts. This amount should come from any funds not currently obligated for living and household expenses like rent, grocery, daycare, or transportation. 
Make a lump-sum payment (above the minimum required payment) to the debt with the highest interest rate. Ensure that the payment is significant but within your means.
Continue making minimum payments on your other obligations until the highest debt is paid off.
Move on to the debt with the next highest interest rate until all your debts are clear.

This strategy takes time, so it's important to be patient and not lose your focus.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

There are benefits and drawbacks that you must weigh out before you begin tackling your debts using this strategy. We've highlighted some of the key pros and cons of using a debt avalanche strategy to pay off your debts below.

Advantages of Debt Avalanches

The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it reduces the total interest you pay in the long term. Interest adds to your debts because most lenders use compound interest. The accrual rate depends on the frequency of compounding—the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest.

A debt avalanche repayment strategy also reduces the amount of time it will take you to get out of debt—assuming you make consistent payments—because less interest accumulates.


If you find yourself overburdened with debt, consider speaking to a financial professional or an organization that specializes in debt relief. Investopedia has a list of debt relief companies that may be able to help you out.

Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

One of the main disadvantages of using the debt avalanche as a repayment strategy is that it only targets interest rates rather than balances. As such, you may not necessarily put a dent in the debt with the highest balance as it only receives the minimum payment. This can be daunting and cause you to feel like you're not making any progress.

The debt avalanche method requires discipline for consistency, which can be a downside for some people. Even with the best intentions of sticking with the debt-avalanche system, you may revert to making minimum payments on all the debts, especially if your financial situation changes. That’s why most financial planners recommend to first save up a six-month emergency fund before attempting any accelerated debt payoff plan.


Pros

Reduces total interest paid

Less time spent getting out of debt

Cons

Targets interest rates rather than (high) balances

Requires discipline and consistency

Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

The debt avalanche is different from the debt snowball. This is another accelerated debt payoff plan that requires a focused, dedicated approach.

With the debt snowball strategy, the debtor uses money beyond the minimum payments to pay off debts with the lowest balance first before moving on to the one(s) with the largest outstanding balance.

This means that you'll pay more than the minimum payment on the debt with the lowest balance until it's paid in full. You'll then move on to the next smallest debt until you eventually reach the one with the highest balance. As with the debt avalanche, you must continue making the minimum payments on the other debts as you paid down the smallest one in the bunch.

Although the debt snowball method doesn't save as much as the debt avalanche in terms of total interest charges, it can be a better strategy for staying motivated by eliminating small debts more quickly.

Most credit card balances compound interest daily, but there are loans where the interest can compound monthly, semiannually, or annually.

Example of a Debt Avalanche

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a debt avalanche works. Let's imagine you have $500 available every month (after you factor in your living expenses) to put toward paying down your debt. Say your current loans include:

$1,000 on a credit card with a 26% annual percentage rate (APR)
$1,250 on a personal loan with a 12% APR
$5,000 line of credit (LOC) with an 8% interest rate

For simplicity’s sake, assume each debt has a minimum monthly payment of $50. You would need to allot $150 toward paying each loan's minimum monthly payment ($50 x 3). The remaining $350 would also be put toward your credit card, the highest-interest debt. After the credit card balance is cleared, you would put the extra money toward the personal loan until it's paid off. Finally, you would put all $500 toward your line of credit, which has the smallest interest rate.

What Is the Difference Between the Debt Avalanche and the Debt Snowball?

The debt avalanche method involves paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. With the debt snowball method, you focus on putting your extra money toward your smallest debt first. The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it saves more in interest in the long term, while the benefit of the debt snowball method is that it can be more motivating.

What Is the Disadvantage of Debt Avalanche?

The major disadvantage of the debt avalanche method can be seen in cases where your highest-interest debt is also your largest debt. If you start putting your extra money toward paying down this debt first, you may save money on interest, but you may not feel like you're making strides toward paying down the loan.

What Is an Example of Debt Avalanche?

For this example of a debt avalanche, say you have three credit cards and are carrying balances on each. The first credit card has a $600 balance with an APR of 24%, the second has a $1,000 balance with an APR of 26%, and the third has a $1,200 balance with an APR of 19%. Using this method, you would first pay down the second credit card because it has the highest interest rate.

The Bottom Line

Whether the debt avalanche or the debt snowball method is the best strategy for paying off debt will depend on your financial situation. Using the debt avalanche method will save you the most money in interest in the long term, but some people find more success with the debt snowball method, which can be more motivating because you'll pay off smaller debts sooner.

Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt. We’ll go over the costs for five popular debt relief options: debt settlement, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt payoff apps, and bankruptcy.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Debt settlement companies: Often 14% to 30% of your debt

Investopedia / Zoe Hansen

The term “debt relief” often refers to debt settlement companies, but it’s also used as an umbrella term to describe just about anything meant to help ease the financial strain from debt. Many types of loans have specific debt relief options, such as recasting a mortgage or the different income-driven payment plans available for federal student loans. When it comes to anything other than simple unsecured debt (like personal loans and credit cards), it’s best to research the specific debt and contact your lender for assistance. 

Costs of Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?
2

Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.

Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.

Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:

Settlement fees: These fees range from 14% to 30% of your debt, but they’re only paid on debts that the company successfully negotiates. Some debt settlement companies base this fee on the amount of settled debt, while others base it on the amount of enrolled debt (again, only concerning accounts that are settled; if the company can’t negotiate one of your debts, you wouldn’t pay fees for that debt).
Monthly account fees: You may be charged a setup and/or monthly fee for the third-party savings account that debt settlement companies require you to use to build up your lump sum payment.

More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:

Income taxes: You’ll generally be required to pay taxes on the amount of debt your creditors forgive when you file your taxes at the end of the year.
3
 Depending on your tax bracket, that could amount to 10% to 37% (in 2024) of the amount that your creditors forgave.
4
Credit damage: Creditors will report late payments, defaults, collections, and debt settlements on your credit reports, which can cause serious damage to your credit. A closed, delinquent account will generally stay on your credit reports for seven years.
5
Late payment fees: Creditors will charge late payment fees, which can cause the amount you owe to increase while you’re not making payments on your debt. These fees add to your balance and can be included in settlements, but if the debt settlement company isn’t successful, you’ll owe all those extra fees, too.
Unsuccessful debt settlement: Although old, one 2007 Federal Trade Commission analysis found that only about half of people successfully completed a debt relief and settlement program.
6
 People who don’t complete the program can end up with worse credit and in more debt than they started with.

If you’re considering debt settlement, it’s important to work with a trustworthy company that doesn’t charge extra-high fees. See the best debt relief companies to explore our top picks.

Costs of Credit Counseling

Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.

Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.
7

Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.
8
 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:

Debt management plan setup fee: $0 to $99
Debt management plan monthly fee: $0 to $75

You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.

Costs of Debt Consolidation/Refinance

Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.

Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.

If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.

Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:

Loan interest: Loans charge interest from the start, albeit at a lower overall rate on average than credit cards (unless you get a 0% APR credit card).
9
Origination fees: Loans often come with origination fees ranging from 1% to 6% or more, especially if you don’t have good or excellent credit.

And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:

Annual fees: Balance transfer cards may come with annual fees, which are sometimes waived in the first year. The best cards don’t charge such a fee, however.
Balance transfer fees: Most balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically ranging from 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
Credit card interest: A 0% APR balance transfer card will start charging interest at the end of the 0% intro period, giving you a good incentive to pay down as much as you can during the interim. It’s also possible to lose your 0% rate if you miss a payment. And, if you make any purchases with the card, that spending will accrue interest at the purchase APR (which may or may not be 0%).

The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 

If you don’t qualify for a 0% APR balance transfer, you may still be able to transfer a balance to a credit card—but it probably won’t be a cost-saving move, because normal credit card rates tend to be relatively high.
9

Costs of Debt Payoff Apps

Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.

Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.

Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.

App	How It Works	Cost
Undebt.it	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $12/year for premium subscription
Debt Payoff Planner	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $2/month for premium subscription
Qapital	Create an automated holistic financial plan, including a debt payoff plan	Free 30-day trial, then $3–$12/month
Bright Money	Create an automated financial plan, including round-ups to pay down debt faster	$10/month–$89/year
Debt Payoff Assistant	Very basic debt snowball planning tool	Free
Costs of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.
10

After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:

Court costs: You’ll typically need to pay over $300 to file various documents with your local bankruptcy court (fee waivers or installment payments are sometimes accepted).
Attorney fees: Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,000—or more—to hire an attorney.
Credit counseling/debtor education course fees: Those who file bankruptcy must enroll in credit counseling and debtor education courses. The price for each course is capped at $50, although you’ll often pay less than half of that.
1

Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
11
 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:

Credit damage: Bankruptcy stays on your credit reports for up to 10 years.
12
 During that period, it may be difficult for you to get approved for credit, utilities, and even rental housing. The severity of the negative effects decreases over time, however.
Social stigma: People who file for bankruptcy may be treated poorly by others, even if the debt wasn’t their fault in the first place.

Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.

If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”

Don’t forget to look up free legal aid clinics and support available in your area, especially if you’re on a limited income or from an underserved community.

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 

“There are debt relief options for just about anyone who owes money,” said Tayne. “Generally, though, once you know there’s an issue with keeping up on payments, that’s the best time to look for a debt relief option.”

It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.

Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:

Starting (or refining) a budget
Asking for help from family and friends
Cutting expenses and increasing income

The average household was $23,317 in the red, excluding mortgage debt, in the second quarter of 2023.
13
 That kind of debt can add unhealthy stress to your life, making it harder to make ends meet and get ahead in life.

The Bottom Line

You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 

Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. 

Do Debt Relief Companies Charge a Fee?

Generally, yes; most types of debt relief companies charge some type of fee, although some options are free. Here’s a quick rundown of the costs you can expect, according to Investopedia research:

Debt settlement companies: Typically 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Certain services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and for balance transfer cards, balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, with much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more
1
How Does Debt Relief Affect Your Credit?

Different debt relief methods have different effects on your credit. Debt payoff apps, credit counseling, and debt management plans don’t have any direct impact on your credit score.
14
 At the other end of the extreme, bankruptcy and debt settlement have the potential to cause severe damage to your credit that can take years to overcome.

How Long Does Debt Relief Last?

Depending on the type of debt relief program you choose, it could be very quick or take a long time. If you’re just looking for help in making your payments, consolidating your high-interest debt into one personal loan can sometimes be completed in a day. On the other hand, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan can take up to five years to complete.
12

Is Debt Relief Worth It?

“In general, if you take the time to research your options and choose a reputable organization or professional, the initial costs will be transparent from the get-go and well worth the savings and relief you get as a result,” said Tayne. To ensure you’re happy with your decision, it’s important to compare all your options and research the full range of costs, including indirect ones such as taxes owed on settled debt. 

How Much Debt Is Too Much?

If you’re having trouble making your monthly payments, you have too much debt. A more specific number to keep in mind, especially for would-be homebuyers, is a debt-to-income ratio of 43%; above this mark, most lenders won’t approve you for a conventional mortgage.
15
 Some debt-averse people are more concerned about the total amount of their debt. By paying down their debt faster they may be able to sleep better at night, even if their monthly payments are currently manageable. "

Building generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and opportunities for your children, grandchildren, and beyond.

Generational wealth is about more than just financial resources, according to Taylor Kovar, certified financial planner (CFP) and CEO of 11 Financial in Lufkin, Texas. “Its value extends beyond the monetary aspect—it’s also about imparting enduring family values and wisdom, creating a legacy that benefits and shapes the lives of future generations,” he said.

Learn more about why generational wealth is important, how to lay the foundations to build wealth for your family, and how to ensure that your legacy is passed on in the most efficient way.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generational wealth refers to passing down assets from one generation to the next.
Before you can build generational wealth, you must create a strong financial foundation by prioritizing savings, growing an emergency fund, and thinking through future plans.
Generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and open opportunities for your children and beyond.
Strategies for building generational wealth include investing in education, financial markets, and real estate, and creating and preserving assets.
Maximizing tax benefits and avoiding debt are crucial for building generational wealth.
The Importance of Building Generational Wealth

Achieving financial success takes a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and planning. Not only can it help you enjoy things in your lifetime, but it can also help your heirs reap the benefits of your legacy and enjoy a financially secure lifestyle after you’re gone.

Think of it as a wealth snowball. For example, generational wealth paves the way for enhanced educational opportunities and, consequently, greater earning potential for your kids, according to Kovar. And then they can continue building upon that foundation for their kids (your grandkids).

The Challenges of Building Generational Wealth 

Building generational wealth is not an easy undertaking, but it’s especially challenging if you grow up in poverty or face systemic barriers. Unfortunately, that has been the experience of many marginalized groups in this country.

For instance, in 2019, the median wealth of White families was 6.5 times that of Black families, 5.5 times that of Hispanic families, and 2.7 times that of Asian and other families, according to the Congressional Budget Office.1

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, data from the St. Louis Fed showed that Black families owned about 23 cents for every $1 of White family wealth, on average. Hispanic families owned about 19 cents for every $1 of White family wealth.2 

Contributing to this racial wealth gap is the fact that Black Americans are less likely to own a home, which is one of the major ways that people pass on wealth.3 The underlying reason for this is, in part, systemic discriminatory practices in home selling, home lending, and appraisals that have been well-documented in recent decades.

Black Americans and other marginalized groups have also historically had less access to banking and financial services and lower credit scores, which has locked them out of various investment opportunities.

If building generational wealth is a goal of yours, there are a few financial moves you can make that can help you achieve this.

Build a Strong Financial Foundation

Building generational wealth is as much about setting a strong example as it is about making the right financial decisions. You can model the building blocks of healthy personal finances to your family, which includes the following best practices.

Prioritize Savings

“It’s not how much you make, but how much you keep. That’s the key to accumulating savings and wealth,” says J.B. Beckett, founder of Beckett Financial Group in West Columbia, South Carolina.

Many people fall into the trap of saying they’ll save what’s left over at the end of the month but never end up getting around to it, or they spend beyond their means. A better approach is to create a budget to control your spending so that you have guaranteed funds available to save and set up an automatic payment to yourself each month.

Here’s how to get started:

Pick a percentage or dollar amount that you are able to allocate toward savings goals after your expenses are covered.
If you have more than one savings goal, create separate accounts for each one.
Consider a high-yield savings account that earns interest on top of your contributions.
Set up automatic payments to each savings account and watch them grow.

For longer-term savings goals, you might consider putting money in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts for a guaranteed return.

Build an Emergency Fund

One of the most important tools for building generational wealth is making sure that you have financial security in case of an emergency or loss of income. That’s where an emergency fund comes in.

Oftentimes, not having an emergency fund is what leads people into debt or causes them to cash out retirement accounts, which not only incurs penalties but also comes with a big opportunity cost.

Ultimately, you want to end up with enough money saved to cover a few months’ worth of expenses, but that will take some time to build up. In the interim, focus on making regular, automated contributions, and save more aggressively if you find ways to trim expenses or develop new income streams. Most important is that you avoid the temptation to withdraw money from the account—it must be reserved for true emergencies.

Involve Kids in Money Conversations

One often-overlooked aspect of building a strong financial foundation is involving your family, and children specifically, in the conversation. This way, they can understand financial basics from a young age, alongside you.

Kevin M. Curley II, certified financial planner and financial advisor at Global Wealth Advisors in Dallas, Texas, recommends including children in the family finances from a young age through fun and games.

“Play Monopoly and teach them poker at the kitchen table,” Curley says. “Consider giving them an allowance and discuss how they plan to spend it. Later, let them invest a small amount in their favorite video game designer or cosmetics manufacturer and track wins and losses together.”

Invest in Education

Once you’ve made some progress on your emergency fund, you can allocate some of your discretionary income toward other big financial goals. A popular one is to save for your children’s education. If you’re aiming to build generational wealth, you can think of college savings for your kids as an investment in their future earning power.

That’s because degree attainment is directly correlated with an increase in lifetime earnings—in the millions, as a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found. According to the study, someone with a high school diploma can expect to earn $1.3 million over a lifetime; a bachelor’s degree holder will earn $2.3 million; a master’s degree can lead to $2.7 million in lifetime earnings; and a professional degree holder can earn $3.6 million.4

Note

Of course, the costs of education are continuing to rise, and it may not be the best option for everyone. It’s best to take a comprehensive look at your financial situation and life goals before deciding to invest in education.

Consider opening a 529 plan, which is a tax-advantaged account that is tax-free when used for eligible educational expenses.5 

Invest in Financial Markets

To build wealth in a meaningful way, the sooner you get started, the better. “Starting early and consistently saving, even in smaller amounts, can lead to significant growth over time, thanks to the power of compound interest,” Kovar says.

While investing in the stock market comes with some risk, if you diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, you can balance risk with growth potential. One popular strategy for beginners is to invest in index funds, which is a collection of many stocks designed to mimic the performance of major market indexes like the S&P 500.

The key to investing in the stock market is to think of it in the long term by riding out the downturns since, historically, it usually bounces back.

Invest in Real Estate

Another popular investment avenue to explore is real estate, thanks to its potential rental income and appreciation in property value. Plus, it’s a strong investment to pass on to your next of kin.

“Exploring various property types, from residential to commercial, can diversify your real estate portfolio,” Kovar says.

If you’re not ready for that level of investment or don’t want the commitment of running a property, Beckett suggests looking into real estate investment trusts (REITs).

Create and Preserve Assets

Building wealth is just step one in creating generational wealth. The next part is making sure that your assets are protected so that they remain available to pass on to future generations. You also want your heirs to be able to retain as much of their inheritance (if relevant) as possible, which is why tax implications come into play.

To ensure your children are protected and set up in the best possible way financially, consider the following actions.

Build an Estate Plan

As your assets grow and become more complex, working with financial professionals and attorneys on estate planning is the smart move. Some considerations include:

Creating a business that you can pass down 
Considering life insurance. “Life insurance is one of the most tax-efficient vehicles to pass on wealth,” Beckett says.
Making sure other insurance needs are met. Make sure you’re covered in case of a catastrophic event involving your home, car, or a medical event. If not, one incident or lawsuit could wipe out your savings.
Maximize Tax Benefits

A number of tax-efficient investing strategies and vehicles can help you retain a greater share of your returns. Some strategies include:

Tax-deferred accounts: Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, offering you an upfront tax break as you invest. You pay taxes when you withdraw your money in retirement.67
Tax-exempt accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are tax-exempt when you withdraw, since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.8
Health savings accounts (HSAs): You contribute tax-free and enjoy tax-free growth. Then, if used for eligible medical expenses, money comes out tax-free, too.9

Work with a tax accountant or financial advisor to learn what strategies are best for you, and ultimately shield the most money from taxes as possible.

Avoid Debt and Financial Pitfalls

Living within your means and having a healthy emergency fund are the two best ways to avoid unnecessary, high-interest debt like high credit card balances. Those types of borrowing costs can prevent you from making progress on your savings and wealth-building goals.

If you do have some debt to contend with, prioritize paying your highest-interest accounts, while still maintaining your contributions to your emergency fund and retirement accounts (though it’s OK to scale back temporarily). Try to use any windfalls of money such as tax returns or monetary gifts to pay off large chunks when those opportunities become available. 

How to Pass Down Generational Wealth

The last aspect of generational wealth is making sure it goes where you want it to go. This involves getting your wishes documented legally. At a very basic level, you can start with a will. But as finances get more complex, you’ll want to go beyond that, according to Curley.

Beckett recommends setting up a trust. “A trust can be efficient for bypassing probate if it’s set up properly,” he says. “And it’s private. If it’s in a trust, it’s not public record.”

Once you have your affairs in order, keep the lines of communication open with your family, letting them know your plans and how to access your documents. This is beneficial on the off chance that a sudden emergency happens and your family needs to take over the financial plans.

How Can I Start Building Generational Wealth If I Have Limited Financial Resources?

Take it one small step at a time. Create a budget that allows you to allocate money toward savings each month. Make lifestyle choices that help fuel your financial goals. And invest in your retirement as early as possible to give it time to grow.

What Are Some Tax-Efficient Strategies for Maximizing Generational Wealth?

There are many tax-efficient strategies that you may consider adopting, such as investing in tax-deferred accounts or Health Savings Accounts. The route you choose to go will depend on your own personal financial situation, so you may want to work with a tax professional or financial advisor. Plus, these individuals can help you stay current with any new tax rules as they are established.

How Can I Protect My Assets and Ensure They Are Passed Down to Future Generations?

Making sure you’re properly insured (through home, auto, and life insurance) and working with an estate planner are the two best ways to protect your assets. In addition, be sure you at least have a will, and consider establishing a trust.

The Bottom Line

If you’re a first-generation wealth builder, committing to taking those first steps of saving money, building an emergency fund, and starting to invest for the long term and following through with consistency will eventually pay off.

Though it might take some sacrifice upfront, building generational wealth has both short- and long-term benefits that make it worth the effort. In your lifetime, you’ll get to enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that your loved ones will be well taken care of financially. You can also share your knowledge and insights with your children and grandchildren to help instill strong financial habits that can help them keep the family legacy strong for the next generation."

Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.

Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Few schools have courses on managing your money, so it is important to learn how through free online articles, courses, blogs, podcasts, or books.
The core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection.
Smart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more.
Being disciplined is important, but it’s also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines.

The Importance of Personal Finance

Personal finance is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).

Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:
1

Credit card balances: Up by $27 billion
Auto loans: Up by $10 billion
Consumer loans and store cards: Up by $1 billion
Total non-housing: Up by $28 billion
Mortgages: Up by $77 billion

Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.

Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.


Areas of Personal Finance

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.

Income

Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.

Spending

Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.

Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.

Saving

Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.

Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.

Investing

Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.

Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.

Protection

Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.

Personal Finance Services

Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:

Wealth Management
Loans and Debt
Budgeting
Retirement
Taxes
Risk Management
Estate Planning
Investments
Insurance
Credit Cards
Home and Mortgage
Personal Finance Strategies

The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.

The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey surveyed 4,000 adults and found that most Americans are concerned about personal finance basics, retirement funding, and investing in crypto.

1. Know Your income

It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.

2. Devise a Budget

A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:

Fifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.
Thirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.
Twenty percent goes toward the future—paying down debt and saving for retirement and emergencies.

It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:

YNAB (You Need a Budget) helps you track and adjust your spending to control every dollar you spend.
PocketGuard is available in both free and paid versions. It uses an algorithm to help you avoid overspending by analyzing your income, bills, goals, and budget.
3. Pay Yourself First

It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.

Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.

4. Limit and Reduce Debt

It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.

On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.
2

Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it.
1
 There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.

Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:
3

Graduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years
Extended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years
Income-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)
5. Only Borrow What You Can Repay

Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.

Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).
4

Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.

Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs, and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your credit score is to constantly pay bills late—or even worse, miss payments.

Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.

6. Monitor Your Credit Score

Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.
5

Factors that determine your FICO score include:
6

Payment history (35%)
Amounts owed (30%)
Length of credit history (15%)
Credit mix (10%)
New credit (10%)

FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850.
7
 Here’s how your credit is rated:
8

Exceptional: 800 to 850
Very good: 740 to 799
Good: 670 to 739
Fair: 580 to 669
Poor: 579 and below

To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
9

Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.

Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.
10

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three major credit bureaus are providing free credit reports weekly. The program was extended twice in 2022 and it is now permanent.
11

7. Plan for Your Future

To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.

Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.

Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.

Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).

While your children are young, take the time to teach them about the value of money and how to save, invest, and spend wisely.

If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.

Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.

8. Buy Insurance

As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.

Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt.
12
 If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.

9. Maximize Tax Breaks

Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.

You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.

After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.
13

10. Give Yourself a Break

Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.

Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.

Personal Finance Skills

The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.

Finance Prioritization: This means that you can look at your finances, discern what keeps the money flowing in, and make sure that you stay focused on those efforts.
Assessing the Costs and Benefits: This key skill keeps professionals from spreading themselves too thin. Ambitious individuals always have a list of ideas about other ways that they can hit it big, whether it is a side business or an investment idea. While there is a place and time for taking a flier, running your finances like a business means stepping back and honestly assessing the potential costs and benefits of any new venture.
Restraining Your Spending: This is the final big-picture skill of successful business management that must be applied to personal finances. Time and again, financial planners sit down with successful people who still manage to spend more than they make. Earning $250,000 a year won’t do you much good if you spend $275,000 annually. Learning to restrain spending on non-wealth-building assets until after you’ve met your monthly savings or debt reduction goals is crucial in building net worth.
Personal Finance Education

Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.

Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.

Online Blogs

Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.

Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.

Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.

At the Library

You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.

Free Online Classes

If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:

Morningstar Investing Classroom offers a place for beginning and experienced investors alike to learn about stocks, funds, bonds, and portfolios. Some of the courses you’ll find include “Stocks Versus Other Investments,” “Methods for Investing in Mutual Funds,” “Determining Your Asset Mix,” and “Introduction to Government Bonds.” Each course takes about 10 minutes and is followed by a quiz to help you make sure that you understood the lesson.
14
EdX is an online learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
15
 It offers at least three courses that cover personal finance: 'Personal Finance, Part 1: Investing in Yourself"" from Wellesley College, “Personal Finance” from Purdue University, and “Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making” from the University of Michigan. These courses will teach you how credit works, which types of insurance you might want to carry, how to maximize your retirement savings, how to read your credit report, and what the time value of money is.
16
“Planning for a Secure Retirement” is an online course from Purdue University. It’s broken up into 10 main modules, and each has four to six sub-modules on topics such as Social Security, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs. You’ll learn about your risk tolerance, think about what kind of retirement lifestyle you want, and estimate your retirement expenses.
17
Podcasts

Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:

Freakonomics Radio and NPR’s Planet Money both make economics enjoyable by using it to explain real-world phenomena such as “how we got from mealy, nasty apples to apples that actually taste delicious,” the Wells Fargo fake-accounts scandal, and whether we should still be using cash.
American Public Media’s Marketplace helps make sense of what’s happening in the business world and the economy.
So Money with Farnoosh Torabi combines interviews with successful business people, expert advice, and listeners’ personal finance questions.

The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.

Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.

What Personal Finance Classes Can’t Teach You

Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:

Discipline

One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.

There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).

To be eligible for a health savings account, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).
18

Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.

Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.

A Sense of Timing

Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""

However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.

The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.

Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.

Emotional Detachment

Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.

Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.

The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.

Many people have loved ones who always seem to need financial help—it is difficult to refuse to help them. If you include planning to assist them in real emergencies using your emergency fund, it can make the burden easier.

Breaking Personal Finance Rules

The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.

Saving or Investing a Set Portion of Your Income

An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.

For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.

Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.

Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.

Long-term Investing/Investing in Riskier Assets

The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.

Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.

The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.

At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.

Best practices are a set of guidelines, ethics, or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action in a given business situation.

Best practices may be established by authorities, such as regulators, self-regulatory organizations (SROs), or other governing bodies, or they may be internally decreed by a company's management team.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Best practices are the working standards or ethical guidelines that provide the best course(s) of action in a given situation.
Companies, regulators, or governing bodies can all set best practices for businesses.
Best practices serve as a roadmap for a company on how to do business and provide the best way to deal with problems and issues that arise.
Steps to setting best practices include researching the industry and competitors, communicating the standards to all employees, setting metrics, managing change, evaluating and refining the best practices.
Two common best practices that have been implemented for inventory management include ""just in time"" and ""kaizen.""
How Best Practices Work

Best practices serve as a general framework for a variety of situations. For instance, in businesses that produce physical products, best practices that highlight efficient ways to complete tasks might be given to employees. Best practices lists may also outline safety procedures in order to minimize employee injuries.

For corporate accountants, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) represent best practices. GAAP is a common set of accounting standards which aim to improve the clarity, consistency, and comparability of the communication of financial information.

GAAP facilitates the cross-comparison of financial information across different companies within the same sector. This benefits investors and the companies they invest in by promoting transparency.

Investment managers may follow best practices when handling a client's money by prudently investing in a well-diversified portfolio and adhering to a client's risk tolerances, time horizons, and retirement goals.

Corporate governance or a code of ethics can serve as best practices for an organization.

Special Considerations

""Best practices"" is a term that can be applied broadly and across a swath of industries. In the world of business, the phrase is used in connection with everything from project management to audit functions to explain the most efficient method of completing a business task.

With the advent of newer quality control systems came the need for a way to apply measurable benchmarks and communicate ways to rapidly implement new standards of excellence across an organization. This is done by identifying problems, quantifying their frequencies, cultivating solutions, and monitoring the execution of those solutions to ensure they solve the issues at hand.

Best Practices as Industry Benchmarks

Best practices can also be used as a benchmark where one company can share actionable solutions with other organizations. Say there's a firm well-known for its best-in-class product distribution infrastructure. When asked to precisely describe the best practices that led to their hyper-efficiency, the company reveals that it outfits all fulfillment staffers with red markers that they may use to sign off on their highest priority deliveries.

Consequently, all red ink orders are given higher levels of scrutiny than others. As more eyes reflexively search for errors when they see red ink, more mistakes can be flagged and corrected.

Although companies share their best practices as a matter of routine, revealing trade secrets that might be easily replicated by the competition would be unwise.

Steps for Developing Best Practices

Here are eight steps for developing best practices:

Do your homework: Research what companies in your industry do regarding best practices, in terms of customer service, hiring, promotions, production, and anything else of import.
Share your information: Once you have determined what best practices are important, communicate this to key individuals in your company so that everyone is on the same page.
Define your metrics: When you determine your best practices make sure they are measurable so you can keep track of progress towards their implementation, and to boost accountability.
Manage change: Employees and others are typically resistant to change. Prepare for this resistance and develop a strategy to move forward when you implement new practices.
Modify and customize for your business: When implementing a best practice, modify it so that it meets the characteristics of your business and fits with your intended goals.
Involve everyone: Like sharing your information, make certain that everyone in the organization is aware of best practices and that they have agreed to abide by them.
Align business and customer needs: Seek guidance from other businesses or customers that might be able to help you refine and better implement your best practices.
Evaluate and refine: As your business evolves, take stock of your best practices and refine if necessary to meet the ways that your organization has changed.

Examples of Best Practices
Just in Time

Just in time (JIT) is a best practices solution focused on inventory that seeks to align materials ordered from suppliers to a production schedule. The goal of JIT is to ensure efficiency and reduce waste by only receiving materials when needed. While this trims inventory costs, it requires businesses to forecast demand for their goods accurately to ensure proper amounts of supplies are on hand.

Kaizen

Kaizen is a Japanese management philosophy that seeks to improve productivity gradually and methodically. It is a Japanese word that means ""change for the better"" or ""continuous improvement.""

Kaizen seeks to involve all employees and improve operations on a continuous basis. Characteristics of kaizen include designing a workplace to be more efficient and impactful by creating a team atmosphere, improving everyday procedures, making sure employees are engaged, and seeking to make jobs more fulfilling, safer, and less tiring.

Best Practices for Investors

With so many stocks to choose from, it can be hard to know which one to pick for your portfolio. In choosing a stock, it's important to know what you want your portfolio to look like and to keep that in mind as time goes by.

As an investor, it's critical to be aware of daily news, not only for the companies you are analyzing or have already invested in but also for world and financial news, as these impact stocks as well. Reading the news is probably the first step in deciding what stock to pick. Understanding which companies are trending, what sectors are primed to do well, and where the economy is heading, will give you an idea of where to start looking.

From there, start compiling a list of stocks that interest you. For example, if you read that new technology has emerged that has made another product obsolete (for example, smartphones making traditional landlines obsolete), you may start looking into such companies.

You can find stocks through research of who the main players are in the sector you are interested in. Conversely, you can look at exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the sector. You can also use screeners to sort through companies based on a variety of factors, such as market cap and earnings. From there, a detailed analysis of a company's financial statements would provide you with information you need regarding the company's health.

What Are Best Practices in Education?

Best practices in education include staying proactive by ensuring your next teaching activity is prepared and set to go before the current one finishes. This allows students to be engaged by reducing disruptions. Encourage communication by involving students in the classroom setting. This can include varying the way in which they provide answers (e.g. verbal, written, visual, in groups, etc.). Work backward by setting an end goal and figuring out how to reach that goal with your students. Always keep your resources, such as lesson plans, so you can build upon what you have done before and refine the way you approach teaching. And lastly, be a role model by setting the examples you want your students to exhibit.
3

What Are Best Practices in Healthcare?

Best practices in healthcare include training your staff so that they know how to deliver great service and put patient care and experience as their main priority. Ensure patient education, which has been proven to improve the overall healthcare experience. A patient that understands the what and why of their health and the care they are getting are usually happier and more comfortable. Establish a care-orientated environment by incorporating small details, such as remembering a patient's name, smiling, listening carefully, and incorporating follow-up calls.
4

What Are Best Practices in Customer Service?

Good customer service starts with good employees. Ensure you are hiring the best people and incentivizing them to join your firm and stay. This can be done through good pay and benefits as well as the overall corporate environment.

Manage customer expectations. Telling a customer that everything will be taken care of is easy, but this isn't always the case. Being upfront and honest with a customer will always keep them grounded and prevent them from being disappointed.

With customer service, first impressions count. Make sure the first impression is perfect. This sets the tone for future engagement and shapes customers' opinions of the service they're receiving. Collect as much data as you can to help them and also personalize the experience.

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios offers clients a solid choice for online banking and investing, with options for investors of all experience levels, including self-directed and managed accounts. Ally is quite competitive within its industry, offering various online banking features, modest commissions, a reasonable fee structure, and low account minimums. Ally has seen some changes with its wealth management advisory rebranded as Personal Advice. This premium hybrid service combining a human advisor and a robo-advisor also offers tax-loss harvesting, although this feature is still absent in the basic offering. We’ll take an extensive look at all that Ally Invest Robo Portfolios has to offer to help you decide if this investing platform is the right fit for your financial goals.

Pros & Cons
Pros

Low minimum to start investing

Low fees and a no-fee option

Socially responsible investing choices

Earn interest on cash balance

Cons

No tax-loss harvesting with the basic robo-advisor

No access to investment advisors at the self-directed or robo level

High cash balances on no-fee accounts

True goal planning is limited

This review is for Ally Invest's managed account offering. We have also reviewed the firm's self-directed brokerage in our online broker reviews.

Account Overview
Account Minimum	$100
Fees	$0 for high cash portfolios with 30% cash; 0.30% annually for portfolios that have low cash allocations
Goal Setting	Initial robo-advisor questionnaire is basic, starting with four primary goals—retirement, major purchase, income generation, wealth building
Available Assets	ETFs and mutual funds only
Customizable Portfolio	No; four portfolios available with a high-cash and a low-cash option for each
View Portfolio Before Funding	Yes
Customer Service	Portfolio specialists are available Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. ET; 24/7 phone and online chat for clients
Financial Advisor Available	Only with the premium service
Cash Management	Cash management is available through a separate account at Ally, not within the Robo Portfolios account
Tax-Loss Harvesting	Only with the premium service
External Account Sync/Consolidation	No
Mobile App	Android, iOS
Account Setup

New and existing customers interested in opening an Ally Invest Robo Portfolios account will find it to be a straightforward process that can be completed online. The platform provides many of the standard account types that many investors have come to expect, such as individual, joint, custodial, traditional individual retirement account (IRA), Roth IRA, and rollover IRA accounts. 

Investors curious to see the portfolio suggestions Ally Invest will give can take the questionnaire before creating an account. First, you must decide if you want a cash-enhanced or a market-focused account. 

You’ll then select your financial goal:


Retirement
Major purchase
Generate income
Build wealth

In the next step, you will update your timeline, liquid assets, and the initial investment you intend to make towards your goal. Once you have selected your risk tolerance, you can choose the portfolio type; options are core, income, tax-optimized, and socially responsible. The robo-advisor will take what you have given it and lay out the suggested portfolio detailing what investments it will include. 

Investors can redo their portfolios as many times as they would like, but investors who are happy with their selection can move on to open an account. Existing customers who already have an account with Ally can open an account and easily transfer from their existing account to fund the new account. However, new customers who fund their accounts with an external one will need to wait for the transfer to be deposited before the portfolio is funded.

Goal Planning

Clients can update investing goals at any time to keep pace with their current goals or changing financial situation. Clients can also utilize Goal Tracker to log in and see how their portfolio is performing and track progress. Ally offers several financial resources to assist clients wherever they are in their financial stage of life.1

INVESTOPEDIA ROBO-ADVISOR SURVEY

According to Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey, when asked to choose from a list of up to three top investment goals that they are most likely to use their robo-advisor to plan for, the majority of respondents said they would use these digital wealth management platforms to invest for making large purchases like houses, vehicles, and travel.

Respondents were able to select more than one, up to three.
Account Services

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios is a streamlined platform that gives clients the option to pick their investments directly or utilize a robo-advisor and take a more hands-off approach. While Ally does offer both types of investing platforms, self-driven trading and robo-advising cannot be combined in the same account. 

Within a self-direct account at Ally Invest Robo Portfolios, clients enjoy no commission fees on U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, or options, and there are no account minimums to get started. Clients also can choose to invest in bonds, mutual funds, and even margin accounts.2 

For the more hands-off approach, Ally Invest Robo Portfolios’ robo-advisor makes investing simple. With just $100, you can start investing in one of Ally’s robo portfolios. Just decide if you want a cash-enhanced portfolio or a market-focused portfolio.3 From there, Ally will put a portfolio together for you based on your investing preferences and risk tolerance. The platform will then automatically monitor and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your goals and asset allocation are on target.

While Ally’s robo platform does offer a fair amount of account customization, there are some types of investments that you will not be able to access, such as REITs, crypto, international stocks, bonds, and fractional shares.

Cash Management

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios offers two options when it comes to cash management in your robo portfolio: cash-enhanced or market-focused. Both accounts offer a nice annual interest rate on any cash that you have in your portfolio; however, the interest rate is adjustable and can change at any time. Right now it is sitting at 4.40%, which is right at the upper end of what is available from other robo-advisors.3

The cash-enhanced portfolio option is a good choice for investors who want an additional layer of security in a fluctuating market. With this option, there are no advisory fees and approximately 30% of your portfolio is allocated to cash that earns the aforementioned 4.4% annual interest rate. If money is taken out, the portfolio is automatically rebalanced to maintain the cash buffer.

The market-focused portfolio is a nice option for investors who want most of their money invested in the market. There is a 0.30% annual advisory fee, which is charged monthly with this account type. With a market-focused portfolio, almost all of your money is invested, with only about 2% held as cash. Like the cash-enhanced account, investors can earn the current annual interest rate of 4.4% on their cash balance and portfolio rebalancing will occur automatically to maintain the market-to-cash ratio if money is withdrawn from the account.3

Portfolio Construction

In addition to deciding between a more cash-focused or market-focused account, Ally Invest Robo Portfolios offers four portfolio options for investors to choose from within the robo-advisor platform.

Core: This portfolio style contains traditional domestic, international, and fixed-income assets, allowing investors the flexibility to choose conservative to more aggressive risk tolerance. 
Income: This portfolio type offers higher dividend yields, appealing to those with a more conservative approach to investing. 
Tax-optimized: This type of investment portfolio uses an assorted collection of tax-advantaged and low-cost ETFs to help investors minimize after-tax contributions to their investment accounts. While automatic tax-loss harvesting is not an option, there are strategies that Ally Invest Robo Portfolios implements that can help to minimize your overall taxes.
Socially responsible: The ESG portfolio style mimics the core portfolio style but with a significant emphasis on companies that rank highly regarding environmental, social, or governance qualities, as noted by benchmark providers within the industry. 

Ally doesn't offer any exposure to alternative asset classes like cryptocurrency or private equity.

Available Assets
Individual Stocks	No
Mutual Funds	No
Fixed Income	No (only through ETFs)
REITs	No
Socially Responsible or ESG Options	Yes
ETFs	Yes
Non-Proprietary ETFs	Yes
Private Equity	No
Crypto, Forex 	No
Portfolio Customization

Users can customize their portfolio with Ally Invest Robo Portfolios in a limited fashion when they utilize the robo portfolio option. Investors answer questions during setup regarding financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon; based on these answers, Ally Invest Robo Portfolios suggests a portfolio to meet those goals. Aside from this, any further customization would need to take place in a self-directed investing account.

Portfolio Management

Managing your portfolio at Ally Invest Robo Portfolios is quite simple when choosing the robo-portfolio option. After choosing your investment style of cash-focused or market-focused, and then deciding which type of investments you want within that portfolio—core (traditional), income, tax-optimized, or socially responsible—you can basically sit back and relax while Ally tracks your investments to make sure they stay on the right path to meet your financial goals. If rebalancing is needed, that will happen automatically, at no extra charge. 

Real-time reporting is a nice feature at Ally Invest Robo Portfolios. Clients can log in at any time to see how their portfolio is performing and track progress with the Goal Tracker function. This tool is also useful to run what-if scenarios and see how adding extra money might help you reach your goals sooner. At this time, Ally does not have the ability to sync external accounts for the purposes of goal tracking or an overall financial snapshot. You can, however, link external accounts to transfer money in or out.

User Experience 
Desktop

Ally offers an intuitive, easy-to-use dashboard that allows investors to quickly view their account status and track progress. Besides being able to view their account, investors have access to manage their investments to:

Research investments, monitor your portfolio, and place trades whenever and wherever you want
Transfer funds between Ally Bank accounts and Ally Invest Robo Portfolios accounts
Generate watchlists

Customer Service

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios offers support 24/7 for clients. For general support, you can call 1-855-880-2559 day or night, send an email, or log in to your account for an online chat option.4 However, to speak with a portfolio specialist, you need to call Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET.5

Security 

Ally has several security measures in place to keep your account and personal information safe:

Anti-virus and anti-malware protection
Firewalls
Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption
2-Step authentication
Credential confidentiality
Automatic logout
Account monitoring
Site and app review

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios is also a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), covering customer claims up to $500,000, which includes a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims. This SIPC protection covers your money in the event that Ally Invest Robo Portfolios fails institutionally; it does not protect against investment losses from fluctuations in the market.6  

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios also has additional coverage of up to $37.5 million, including up to $900,000 in cash with an aggregate cap of $150 million. Another important item to note regarding this is that protection does not cover forex trading, which is only available to self-directed investors through Ally Invest Forex LLC.7

Education 

Ally has a large financial education section that is updated regularly with content to help you run the numbers to see what it will take to reach your future goals.8 There are still calculators sprinkled throughout, but the education section has been revamped to address overall topics like paying down debt, traveling, and buying a home. The content is clear, well-written, and practical.

Additionally, Ally has educational resources for all ages to learn about finance:9

Adventures With Money: This resource, designed for younger elementary students, pairs a book series with interactive games to teach the fundamentals of financial responsibility and good money habits.
Fintropolis: Geared toward middle and high school students, Fintropolis (a world for Minecraft) utilizes real-world scenarios to acquaint students with financial concepts and the basics of personal finance. In the game, Fintropolis’ residents can earn gold to purchase homes and learn about financial decision-making.
Wallet Wise: This financial resource helps people of all ages take charge of their financial future. People new to investing and budgeting can learn the basics using online resources and live sessions.
Commissions and Fees

Ally is transparent regarding fees and commissions on the services it offers within its portfolios. Investors have two options to allocate their portfolio funds, the cash-enhanced and market-enhanced portfolios. Both require a minimum investment of $100, but that’s where the similarities stop.  

The cash-enhanced portfolio does not charge any advisory fees. However, investors will notice that 30% of their portfolio will be left in cash, which is an abnormally large percentage even if it does earn monthly interest. The cash-enhanced portfolio could experience performance drag in the long term from uninvested money, which is something that investors need to consider.  

The market-enhanced portfolio charges an annual 0.30% advisory fee.10 The fees are incorporated into your account. However, this portfolio only keeps 2% of your portfolio in cash. The cash will still accumulate interest, but most of your portfolio will be heavily utilized in the market, abiding by the goals that you have set. Most investors with longer-term time horizons and more risk appetite will choose this option, as it makes the most sense even if an annual fee is charged.  


Ally also has its rebranded wealth management service for accounts over $100,000 in value, now called Personal Advice. This service has a tiered management fee starting at 0.85% up to $250,000, 0.80% up to $1,000,000, and 0.75% for each dollar above one million. This service still uses some of the robo portfolio features, but the dedicated advisor has more options for customization and other strategies, like tax-loss harvesting, that are unavailable in the basic robo advisory.11

Category	Cash-Enhanced Portfolio Fee	Market-Focused Portfolio Fee
Management Fees for $5,000 Account	$0	$1.25/month, or $15/year
Management Fees for $25,000 Account	$0	$6.25/month, or $75/year
Management Fees for $100,000 Account	$0	$25/month, or $300/year
Termination Fees	$0 ($50 ACAT transfer out fee for all Ally accounts)	$0 ($50 ACAT transfer out fee for all Ally accounts)
Expense Ratios 	0.05-0.11%	0.05%-0.17%
Mutual Funds	N/A	N/A
The Bottom Line

Ally Invest Robo Portfolios has several investing options designed to attract investors of all experience levels. While there is only limited customization with the robo portfolios, the low costs and easy, hands-off approach allow novice investors to put a plan in place to start saving immediately. The desktop and mobile platforms offer several financial tools and the ability to track and manage your portfolio easily.

Overall, the low costs and straightforward platform make Ally Invest Robo Portfolios a solid option. Of course, Ally also has a larger financial ecosystem, making it possible for investors to bring more of their financial life onto a single platform. This includes banking services, credit cards, mortgages, and loans. From an investing perspective, there is also the zero commission stock and ETF trading through a self-directed account to consider. Ally Invest Robo Portfolios becomes a more attractive option for investors if you are looking to consolidate your financial life with Ally anyway.

How We Review Robo-Advisors

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We used our 2023 consumer survey to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 robo-advisor awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 64 questions to each of the 21 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Jan. 8, to Feb. 9, 2024.

We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 59 criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:

Account Services: 10.00%
Account Setup: 5.00%
Customer Service: 5.00%
Fees: 15.00%
Goal Planning: 21.00%
Portfolio Contents: 17.00%
Portfolio Management: 17.00%
Security & Education: 5.00%
User Experience: 5.00%

Additionally, during our 2023 research, many of the companies we reviewed granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.

Read more about how we research and review robo-advisors.

Separately, our research team conducted a survey of 205 U.S. adults aged 18 to 72 who are current clients of one of 18 robo-advisors. While the information collected did not influence the development of our ratings model, it was instrumental in gathering the valuable insights published in Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey.

Participants in our 2023 Robo-Advisor Survey opted in to an online, self-administered questionnaire from a market research vendor. Data collection took place between Aug. 30 and Sept. 15, 2023, with 11 video interviews conducted with volunteer respondents from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17, 2023. Multiple quality checks, including screeners, attention gauges, comprehension evaluations, and logic metrics, among others, were used to ensure only the highest quality responses were included.

These portfolios select stocks based on a company’s ESG practices, along with more traditional financial measures.

This has spawned a new family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on investing criteria for the social good. These relatively new ETFs allow investors to achieve diversification while owning companies that follow specific ESG criteria.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Impact investing securities have outperformed the broader market over the past year.
The impact investing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the best one-year trailing total returns are FXU, PUI, and IHF.
The top holdings of these funds are NRG Energy Inc., EQT Corp., and UnitedHealth Group Inc., respectively.

There are 56 distinct impact investing ETFs that trade in the United States with an ESG score of 9.5 or higher out of 10 from VettaFi's ESG screener, excluding inverse and leveraged ETFs, as well as funds with less than $50 million in assets under management (AUM). Impact investing securities, as measured by the S&P 500 ESG Index, have outperformed the broader market over the past year. The index has provided a total return of -6.5% compared with the S&P 500’s total return of -8.1%, as of Sept. 12, 2022.1 The best-performing impact investing ETF, based on performance over the past year, is the First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund (FXU).

We examine the best three impact investing ETFs below. These ETFs are ones that have a high ranking according to VettaFi's ESG metrics, not ones that explicitly have an ESG goal in their prospectus. All numbers below are as of Sept. 12, 2022.2 In order to focus on the funds' investment strategy, the top holdings listed for each ETF exclude cash holdings and holdings purchased with securities lending proceeds except under unusual cases, such as when the cash portion is exceptionally large.

Our Take

The Betterment platform stands out for its excellent selection of automated portfolios, reasonable fees, and well-designed user journey. Betterment has also been expanding its offerings to crypto and 401(k) and 529 plans (available through Betterment at Work). The robo-advisor's push into serving employers in addition to individuals now includes a new product that allows small business owners to match employees' student loan payments with a 401(k) contribution. This new feature is enabled by the Secure Act 2.0 legislation to help people save for retirement while paying off student loans.

 We'll dig deeper into Betterment to see how it stacks up in an increasingly competitive robo-advisory field.


Pros & Cons
Pros

User-friendly platform makes it easy to set goals and track progress

No weekend phone customer service

No individual stocks or other investments for trading

Cash Reserve is only available to clients of Betterment LLC, which is not a bank, and cash transfers to program banks are conducted through the clients’ brokerage accounts at Betterment Securities. For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.

Checking accounts and the Betterment Visa Debit Card provided and issued by nbkc bank, Member FDIC. Checking is made available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment Financial LLC nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC reimburses ATM fees and the Visa® 1% foreign transaction fee worldwide, everywhere Visa is accepted.

Account Setup

Similar to all the robo-advisors we’ve reviewed, you can set up a Betterment account entirely online. To get started, simply create a username and password on Betterment’s website. Next, you’ll need to provide the following personal information:

Name
Phone number
Email address
Mailing address
Date of birth
Social Security number (SSN)

 You’ll also need to upload a form of government-issued ID, like your U.S. driver’s license.
3

The platform will then give you a questionnaire about your goals, time horizon, and investment risk tolerance. Based on your responses, the platform will recommend stock and bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that fit your goals. Unfortunately, you can’t see the portfolio recommendation without setting up your account first. However, you can get the recommendation without depositing any money.

Betterment does not have a minimum account balance requirement but does require each deposit to be at least $10. Betterment offers free deposits and withdrawals.

Betterment has also been expanding its services to other investment accounts. You can open a 529 plan (only through an employer) to invest for future college expenses with tax advantages. Betterment also works with employers to offer its portfolios through 401(k) plans.

Goal Planning

As a robo-advisor, Betterment’s job is to create a portfolio that matches your financial goals. You start by picking from a list of common financial goal types that include:

Major Purchase
Education
Retirement
Retirement Income
General Investing
Emergency Fund

You can pick multiple goals with a different portfolio for each one. You then set your time horizon for each goal. The Betterment robo-advisor will suggest an appropriate portfolio allocation. For example, if you select retirement with over 20 years to go, the platform will recommend a portfolio made up of 90%+ of stocks. On the other hand, if you’ve already reached your retirement age, the robo-advisor will recommend a portfolio with a lesser amount in stocks to protect your savings.

The closer you are to your goal, the more conservative the recommended portfolio will be. Betterment also adjusts based on your selected risk tolerance, ranging from very aggressive to very conservative.
4

The Betterment platform forecasts how likely you are to reach your long-term goals based on your current savings and project investment returns. If you have other investment accounts, you can also link them to the platform to include those in the forecast.
5

Betterment also lets you set and track goals for crypto investing and saving money in its cash management accounts.
4
 Overall, these goal-setting tools make it easy to figure out how to use Betterment effectively.

INVESTOPEDIA ROBO-ADVISOR SURVEY

According to Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey, when asked to choose from a list of up to three top investment goals that they are most likely to use their robo-advisor to plan for, the majority of respondents chose large purchases like houses, vehicles, and travel.

Respondents were able to select more than one, up to three.
Account Services

You can access investment, cash management, and checking accounts as a Betterment user. With this combination, you can manage all your money in one place. Next, we’ll discuss what these different accounts offer and whether they are worth it.

Cash Management

Betterment has a few different account offerings within its platform. The investing account is the robo-advisor, but there are also crypto, cash reserve, and checking accounts. Betterment’s cash management account lets you safely store uninvested cash and earn a generous interest rate at its program banks. Customers earn a variable APY* of 5.00%,
6
 which is much higher than the competition and right behind Wealthfront's current rate of 5.00% (5.50% when you refer a friend). When you're a new Betterment customer, you also receive an even higher bonus APY of up to 0.75% for three months with a qualifying deposit (terms apply).
6
 There’s no minimum account balance requirement, but you must deposit at least $10 when you open the account. There are no fees, and you can make unlimited, free withdrawals.
7



Betterment also offers a separate checking account with a debit card. You can use this debit card to make purchases and get free withdrawals from any ATM in the world; Betterment reimburses any fees. The debit card also earns cash back when you spend at select retailers like Costco, Adidas, and Aeropostale.
8

For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.

Portfolio Construction

Betterment builds its portfolios using stock and bond ETFs. It follows an asset allocation strategy based on modern portfolio theory that analyzes each asset's overall risk versus return contribution to build these portfolios for investors. Betterment uses equity funds for stocks in U.S., international, and emerging markets.

For bonds, Betterment uses a combination of U.S., international, and emerging market bond funds. This is one area where Betterment stood out, as it’s not common for robo-advisors to allow investments in international bonds. Betterment has also created new cryptocurrency portfolios.
9

As an investor, you pick between a combination of different strategies from Betterment. These are:
10

Core: Built for long-term investing and low costs using stocks and bond investments from around the world
Innovative Technology: Focuses on high-growth tech companies like clean energy, semiconductors, and robots
Climate Impact: Invests in companies with lower carbon emissions while still offering decent long-term returns
Social Impact: Provides more of a focus on companies working towards minority empowerment and gender diversity
Blackrock Target Income: A 100% bond portfolio with different yields to offset stock market volatility
Goldman Sachs Smart Beta: Looks to outperform the market by upping the risk level
Value Tilt: A portfolio that looks for companies that are undervalued and tilts towards investing more in them
Broad Impact: Looks for companies that rank highly in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, balancing this filter with long-term performance
10
Sustainable: Looks for crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that prioritize using less energy to validate transactions on large liquid digital assets
BTC/ETH: Provides direct exposure to the most liquid and well-known coins
11
Universe: Invests across the crypto landscape, including decentralized finances and the metaverse

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one notable asset missing from Betterment’s robo-advisor portfolios. The company believes that real estate as a sector is already well represented in its equity portfolios.
9
 You can, however, access REITs through Betterment’s Flexible portfolio where you customize allocations and assets. The Flexible portfolios still have automatic rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, but choosing a Flexible portfolio does disable the auto adjustment to the portfolio risk level as your target goal date approaches.
12

Available Assets 
Individual Stocks	No
Mutual Funds	No
Fixed Income	Yes (only through ETFs)
REITs	Only in customized portfolios
Socially Responsible or ESG Options	Yes: Broad Impact, Climate Impact, Social Impact
ETFs	Yes
Non-Proprietary ETFs	Yes
Private Equity	No
Forex 	No
Crypto	Yes, through a separate account offering
Portfolio Customization

If you’d like to change your portfolio beyond the recommendations of the standard Betterment portfolios, you can do so through its Flexible portfolio option. You start with a portfolio distribution to match Betterment’s Core portfolio. Then, you adjust what percentage goes into the different investments, such as increasing the percentage in international stocks while decreasing how much you have in U.S. large-cap stocks.

The flexible portfolio also allows you to add asset groups that are not part of the standard robo-advisor portfolios, like commodities, high-yield bonds, and REITs. The Betterment investment review will analyze your customized portfolio to give ratings for your overall risk and portfolio diversification. Betterment also forecasts your future return for both good and bad market conditions.
12

There is a limit to how much you can customize, as Betterment restricts you to only investing in ETFs. You cannot trade through Betterment and buy individual stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Betterment also doesn’t offer margin trading. You need to pay for any investments upfront without borrowing.
13

Portfolio Management

Betterment automatically rebalances your portfolio whenever an asset goes beyond 3% of your target allocation due to portfolio drift or when your account balance is at or past the minimum threshold. Rebalancing is usually done dynamically as deposits come in, but Betterment can sell assets that are overweighted to buy those that are underweighted to get back to your targets. Betterment’s system checks your portfolio once a day for automated adjustment.

Betterment’s system considers taxes for portfolio management. It checks which assets you’ve owned for less than a year that would trigger more expensive short-term capital gains versus long-term capital gain investments. The system prioritizes selling long-term assets for rebalancing to give your short-term investments time for better tax treatment.

If you change your target portfolio allocation, Betterment also rebalances to the new targets. You can turn off the automatic rebalancing so the platform only readjusts when you deposit or withdraw money.
14

Betterment also uses automatic tax-loss harvesting, seeking opportunities to find taxable losses in your portfolio to offset taxable gains. It aims to replace assets with something similar so you keep in the same position while also receiving the tax benefit.
15

Key Portfolio Management Features
Automatic Rebalancing	Daily account monitoring, triggered when portfolio drifts 3% from the target allocation and account meets minimum balance threshold
Reporting Features	Dashboard provides a financial overview with net worth, goal progress, and investment performance; Betterment provides regular nudges and reminders to keep users invested
Tax Loss Harvesting	Yes; it keeps users invested and avoids short-term capital gains tax
External Account Syncing/Consolidation	Yes; clients can link retirement, banking, and brokerage accounts, but only Betterment assets are rebalanced

Betterment is not a licensed tax advisor. Tax Loss Harvesting+ (TLH+) is not suitable for all investors and is subject to certain conditions. Read more at https://www.betterment.com/legal/tax-loss-harvesting and consider your personal circumstances before deciding whether to utilize Betterment’s TLH+ feature. Investing involves risk. Performance not guaranteed.

User Experience
Desktop

The Betterment desktop platform is clear, well-designed, and offers an excellent user experience. In one dashboard, you can see your investment performance, net worth, and balances, including outside accounts you linked to Betterment. You can also schedule deposits and turn features like tax-loss harvesting on or off. You can track your progress towards various goals and adjust your strategies as needed, too. Betterment’s excellent user experience is one of its major strengths.
16

Mobile

Betterment’s mobile app is available for both iOS and Android. It also gives you the same overview of your accounts, including Betterment ratings on performance, and allows you to schedule future deposits.
17
 The mobile app does have some limitations compared to the desktop, however. For example, it doesn’t provide the same level of detail on investments or allow you to access your tax documents. Still, it’s a quality option for checking your account on the go.

Betterment provides phone and email customer service Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. It also provides a virtual chatbot that can answer questions 24/7. The lack of customer support on weekends is a drawback compared to major brokers.
19

If you want to speak with an investment professional, you can buy packages starting at $299 to speak with a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) working for Betterment. You can schedule these calls for free if you have a premium account.

Security

Betterment’s security protocols do an excellent job of protecting your identity and data. They include:

Website encryption
Two-factor authentication for logging in
Biometric authentication for mobile devices
Limited data access for employees
Fraud protection procedures
Protected password storage for third parties
21

In addition, Betterment provides high limits of insurance for your accounts:

Cash Reserve accounts are eligible for up to $2 million ($4 million for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance ($250,000 insurance per program bank)
13
Checking accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 for individual accounts and $250,000 per depositor for joint accounts
22
Investment accounts include $500,000 of SIPC insurance for missing funds, with $250,000 for cash claims
23


Education

Betterment provides an FAQ section, a help center, and an educational library of articles on its website. The educational articles cover investment topics like investment portfolios, retirement planning, and saving money. Betterment has some videos and guides, though most of its resources are articles.
24
  Betterment also provides some online tools like an investment analysis tool and a goal tracker.

While Betterment’s educational resources are reasonable, they are not quite as comprehensive as what’s available from other companies. Betterment’s focus is offering support through the robo-advisor and other investment tools.


Commissions and Fees

Betterment’s fees are transparent and reasonable for a robo-advisor. A basic account is $4 per month. If you have at least $20,000 across all your Betterment accounts, the cost changes to a flat fee of 0.25% of your investment account per year instead. You can also qualify for the annual 0.25% pricing by setting up monthly recurring deposits of $250.

For a premium account that includes access to financial advisors, you must deposit at least $100,000 and will owe an annual fee of 0.65%.

Betterment does not charge commissions for your investment trades. The portfolios themselves will charge an expense ratio, but Betterment works to keep these low. For example, depending on your allocation, its core portfolio charges from 0.05% to 0.16% per year.
25

If you’d like to speak with a financial advisor without a Premium account, you can pay by session. Depending on the topic, the sessions cost between $299 and $399.
20

For crypto investing, Betterment charges 1% of your account balance as trading expenses, which can go up to 0.15% of transactions depending on the trade.
26

The Bottom Line

Betterment has become arguably the most popular robo-advisor for good reason: It offers a wide selection of portfolios, an excellent user experience, high-quality automated portfolio management, and competitive fees. If you want access to human financial advisors, you can access them through Betterment at a competitive rate versus hiring your own. Finally, Betterment continues to expand its offerings with a cash management account, a 529 plan (offered through an employer), cryptocurrency investing, and options for 401(k) workplace retirement plans.

Like any company, Betterment also has some cons. It doesn’t offer customers the ability to trade or buy individual investments, and its educational library also could be more comprehensive. Still, these are minor quibbles for one of the best robo-advisors around. Although it doesn't affect the quality of the robo-advisor, it is interesting to note that Betterment is adding more and more services for companies and employers. As traditional brokerages have gotten into robo-advisors, one of the original robo-advisors is starting to look more like a large, traditional brokerage.

Everything You Need to Know About Robo-Advisors
Does Betterment Charge a Monthly Fee?

Betterment charges a $4 monthly fee for its robo-advisor investment account. However, you switch to an annual management fee of 0.25% of your investment account balance if you have a balance with Betterment over $20,000 or set up automatic deposits for $250 per month. Betterment does not charge any fee to use its Cash Reserve or checking account.
26

How Does Betterment Help You Save Money on Taxes?

Betterment looks for tax-loss harvesting opportunities in a taxable account on a regular basis. The algorithm avoids wash sales and takes external accounts into consideration. Tax-loss harvesting at Betterment may be paused or postponed when markets are choppy, but over time the tax-loss harvesting can reduce an investor's tax burden by realizing losses to offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio. Tax-loss harvesting does not apply to the crypto portfolios.
27

Is Betterment FDIC Insured?

Betterment is FDIC insured for its checking and Cash Reserve accounts. The checking account has standard FDIC coverage of up to $250,000 per account.
22
 The Cash Reserve account offers FDIC insurance up to $2 million for individual accounts and $4 million for joint accounts through program banks. It provides higher limits as Betterment spreads cash across multiple program banks for higher coverage.
13

Betterment’s investment accounts do not have FDIC insurance, which only applies to deposit accounts. Instead, the investment account has SIPC insurance up to $500,000 for missing funds, with a $250,000 limit to cover missing cash.
23

Is Betterment Safe?

Yes, Betterment is safe as it provides numerous security features like two-factor authentication, encryption, and biometric authentication for mobile access. Betterment also has FDIC insurance for deposit accounts and SIPC insurance for investment accounts. If you invest with Betterment, there is always the chance that you could lose money based on your investment performance, but the Betterment security measures are very safe.

Is Betterment Only in the U.S.?

Yes, Betterment is only available in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but not in Guam. It does not accept customers from other countries. Americans living or working abroad also cannot use Betterment. When you sign up, you must provide proof of a U.S. permanent address and a U.S. banking account. Betterment does support U.S. military personnel living abroad as long as they can provide a valid U.S. address.
3

Who Owns Betterment?

Betterment is privately traded and owned by professional investors and venture capital firms who funded the company. This includes Investment AB Kinnevik, Bessemer Venture Partners, Francisco Partners, and Menlo Ventures.
28
 Together, they hold ownership under Betterment Holdings Company. Jonathan Stein founded Betterment. He was CEO until 2020 and now remains with Betterment as a board member.
29
 Stein was replaced as CEO by Sarah Kirshbaum Levy.

How We Review Robo-Advisors

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We used our 2023 consumer survey to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 robo-advisor awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 64 questions to each of the 21 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Jan. 8 to Feb. 9, 2024.

We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 59 criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:


Goal Planning - 21.00%
Portfolio Contents - 17.00%
Portfolio Management - 17.00%
Fees - 15.00%
Account Services - 10.00%
Account Setup - 5.00%
Customer Service - 5.00%

Security & Education - 5.00%
User Experience - 5.00%

Additionally, during our 2023 research, many of the companies we reviewed granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.

Read more about how we research and review robo-advisors.

Separately, our research team conducted a survey of 205 U.S. adults aged 18 to 72 who are current clients of one of 18 robo-advisors. While the information collected did not influence the development of our ratings model, it was instrumental in gathering the valuable insights published in Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey.

Participants in our 2023 Robo-Advisor Survey opted in to an online, self-administered questionnaire from a market research vendor. Data collection took place between Aug. 30 and Sept. 15, 2023, with 11 video interviews conducted with volunteer respondents from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17, 2023. Multiple quality checks, including screeners, attention gauges, comprehension evaluations, and logic metrics, among others, were used to ensure only the highest quality responses were included.

Merrill Lynch & Company was a famous full-service broker that was absorbed by Bank of America in 2009. E*TRADE, the high-profile discount brokerage, was acquired by full-service broker Morgan Stanley in 2020. Additionally, both companies are among the winners in our list of the best robo-advisors of 2024, with Merrill Guided Investing winning best for education, while E*TRADE Core Portfolios is best for mobile.

Both robo-advisors successfully simplify investment decisions by offering a collection of useful portfolio alternatives that don’t require a sophisticated understanding of finances. Both also assume that their clients want a balance of risk management and growth potential, and the option of selecting environmentally friendly investment choices. However, they differ in their approach to delivering these features. As you’ll learn from this head-to-head comparison, the most significant differences are found in the cost, portfolio management, and customer service features of these two platforms.

Account Setup
Merrill Guided Investing

Setting up a Merrill Guided Investing account is a straightforward procedure. You begin by answering basic investment questions in an online questionnaire. Here you’ll specify your investing goals, financial contributions, and timelines for investing. If you have multiple investment accounts, the questionnaire is comprehensive enough to include them in its eventual calculations as well. You can then choose your risk tolerance or answer a few questions that will yield a suggestion to consider.

The next step requires you to choose your primary investing goal and provide a customized name for it. That sets you up to select between a market-tracking portfolio, which focuses on getting the best gains, or a portfolio that favors companies with high scores in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Before completing the sign-up, you receive a targeted asset allocation, ranging from conservative to aggressive, based on your questionnaire answers. This tradeoff between performance-seeking and values-based investing allows the platform to cater to your personal preferences.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

The first step includes answering a dozen or so questions which are mostly aimed at helping you understand your risk tolerance. These sections are very well done and will help you better understand the tradeoff every investor has to make between risk tolerance and targeted returns.

The final step in the online questionnaire asks whether you want to add a specific investing focus. Here you are offered a choice of emphasizing ETFs that target socially responsible investing (SRI), similar to the ESG criteria mentioned earlier. Another alternative mentioned is a focus on smart beta strategies in an attempt to outperform the market. It isn’t abundantly clear that this choice is a mutually exclusive tradeoff between favoring a values-based investment style and performance-hunting investing style, but that is the case since you can only select one or neither of them.

Account Setup Verdict: E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios gets the edge in account setup. While both robo-advisors have an easy onboarding, we appreciated the extra level of portfolio detail with the types of funds that would be in the allocation that E*TRADE Core Portfolios creates. E*TRADE also has an edge in account minimums, at $500 versus $1000 for Merrill Guided Investing.

Account Types

For both Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios, the final setup steps are to choose the account type and fund the account.

The account types available on both platforms include:

Individual or joint brokerage accounts
Retirement accounts, including traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, simplified employee pensions (SEP), SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) to IRA rollovers, and others
Custodial accounts, including Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) and Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts
Account Types Verdict: Tie

Both of these robo-advisors offer all the commonly used accounts as well as the custodial varieties. The vast majority of investors will find the account types they need at either of these companies.


Account Services
Merrill Guided Investing

This platform offers excellent tools and features, including the following highlights:

Research tools: The platform offers excellent goal-planning tools and calculators that can be accessed by all clients who meet the minimum starting balance of $1,000.
2
Access to financial advisors: Clients can speak with financial advisors if they pay a 0.85% management fee and maintain a $20,000 balance.
2
Preferred rewards: Program clients qualify more quickly for Bank of America Preferred Rewards, including management fee discounts and lower interest rates on loans.
3
E*TRADE Core Portfolios

This platform caters to customers who need assistance along the way by including the following features and services.

Access to help: Platform clients can speak with staff by phone or at branch offices.
Values vs. performance portfolios: Clients can select portfolios filtered through sustainability and corporate governance criteria, or they can select portfolios with the goal of beating the market through the use of smart beta strategies.
Low minimum balance: The $500 minimum lets smaller and younger investors get started investing towards their goals with limited risk.
1
Cash Management

Neither E*TRADE Core Portfolios nor Merrill Guided Investing stands out in terms of cash management. These digital investment platforms are part of a larger financial ecosystem that offers more cash management offerings like loans, checking accounts, and so on. In terms of cash inside the platform, E*Trade Core Portfolios holds 1% of your portfolio in cash and it is swept into a money market account that yields just 0.01%.
4
 Merrill Guided Investing also allocates some percentage to cash and offers a solid 5.17%.
5

Cash Management Verdict: Merrill

It is difficult to compare robo-advisors that have added cash management features to full financial firms that have added robo-advisors. Both E*TRADE and Merrill Guided Investing have full-featured cash management adjacent to their platforms, just not within them. Merrill Guided Investing takes the category here for having a higher interest rate on cash held in the account.

Goal Planning
Merrill Guided Investing

Merrill Guided Investing shows its strength in goal planning. It has you select a singular goal for your account and then helps you select a portfolio style that gives you the right mix of risk and reward to accomplish your goal.

This platform walks you through its questionnaire and generates more opportunities for portfolio customization after you enter a birthdate, goal amount, and the goal’s time horizon. The platform is focused on retirement by default, but it allows you to define non-retirement goals that include:

Retirement at a specific age
General investing
Home
Education
Family support
Travel
Special occasions
Other large purchases

While there is no guidance for figuring out appropriate targets or time horizons for these goals, and you can only select one for the entire account, the platform does a great job integrating goal-planning tools and tracking functions, and providing prompts for funding to help investors stay on track. With these tools, you can set target time frames with educated estimates.  

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios doesn’t spend as much time on your choice of goals, but rather assumes you have the singular goal of maximizing your returns for wealth, retirement, or something else. The platform instead orients you to the subject of risk tolerance right from the start.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios seeks to eliminate confusion by simplifying your focus. The platform is built on the assumption that you want to maximize performance, so its opening questionnaire will help you identify your tolerance for fluctuating account values over the years ahead. 

This is a key concept for any investor who wants to achieve their desired performance. Investors who don’t understand their own risk tolerance are much more likely to sabotage their investing goals by changing strategies over time. E*TRADE Core Portfolios users do have access to E*TRADE’s extensive research and educational resources, including retirement calculators and other planning tools, but the functions are not built into the Core Portfolios questionnaire experience, so they are only useful after the account has been opened.

Goal Planning Verdict: Merrill Guided Investing

While both platforms arrive at a similar end through different means, investors who are goal-oriented will appreciate Merrill’s approach.

Portfolio Construction
Merrill Guided Investing

Merrill's offering has several different investment strategies that align both with the firm’s research and your answers to the questionnaire you completed when opening the account. Though the strategies may target various investing approaches, they follow the classic principles of modern portfolio theory (MPT). 

The platform’s offerings have no set schedule for rebalancing, as they can be triggered by changing risk profiles, contributions, and withdrawals or unspecified market conditions. The platform’s portfolios are directed by a mix of algorithms and fund managers’ guidance. The risk tolerances are low, medium, and high, and there is the option to have socially responsible investment principles inform your allocations. Merrill Guided Investing is all through funds, so it does not offer any exposure to alternative assets like cryptocurrency.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios are also based on MPT principles and offer highly diversified swaths of the international and domestic market. This is due to the tie-up with Morgan Stanley increasing the pool of equities and tweaks to the model to consider equities of different sizes to increase overall diversification. In addition to improved asset depth, E*TRADE Core Portfolios has tweaked its risk models. Core Portfolios previously had a range from low-risk portfolios with 20% bonds and cash equivalents and 80% stocks up to high-risk with 80% stocks and 20% bonds. These have been expanded to include an all-risk portfolio which is 100% equities.  E*TRADE Core Portfolios are all done through funds, like Merrill Guided Investing, so no alternative assets like cryptocurrency are available.

Portfolio Customization

As with most robo-advisor solutions, the construction of a portfolio of ETFs and mutual funds begins with a starting allocation algorithmically determined based on the questionnaire answers.  From there, the portfolio strategy can only be enhanced and customized in limited ways, specifically to either incorporate a focus on socially responsible investing (SRI)/ESG criteria or to focus on market-beating strategies, which means accepting greater risk. 

Merrill Guided Investing

Beyond the initial setup of a portfolio, you can specify as part of the questionnaire that you prefer a portfolio solution based on ESG criteria. The fine print on the website adds a bit of caution that investors should take note of; for instance, ESG investing poses certain risks by limiting the account's investment options. Investors who set their preferences solely based on ESG criteria will waive prospecting investment opportunities that could benefit their portfolio.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios customization has improved in the sense that you have more risk models to choose from. With E*TRADE Core Portfolios, you also can nudge the algorithm to go beyond the initial portfolio selection by adopting a focus towards either SRI goals or smart beta goals. This customization creates a tradeoff between a values-oriented strategy and a performance-oriented strategy, though neither customization is a required ingredient of your strategy.

Portfolio Customization Verdict: E*TRADE Core Portfolios

While neither of these robo-advisors stands out in the industry in terms of customization, E*TRADE Core Portfolios takes this category by having more options and a larger underlying tweak to the portfolios with an all-risk model portfolio.

Portfolio Management

This is a major point of differentiation between the two platforms, as E*TRADE’s robo platform uses a set rebalancing schedule and Merrill’s does not. Although this difference is clearly defined, the anticipated benefit or cost of this difference is not. Neither broker provides any data or theory that forecasts which approach is likely to provide better performance. However, it is logical to conclude that the human fund managers included in the Merrill Guided Investing platform are likely related to the higher fees the broker charges. 

Merrill Guided Investing

The platform allows for rebalancing the account under a variety of circumstances. These rules are intended to optimize performance for investors by aligning the account to the target asset allocation. The criteria for rebalancing allows for variations of asset performance, market conditions, and human managers’ discretion to account for unforeseen events.
7
 Merrill Guided Investing also takes your synced accounts under consideration when managing your account.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

Accounts are monitored daily and rebalanced semi-annually to align with the initial allocation identified by the algorithm at the account opening.
8
 E*TRADE Core Portfolios have a drift tolerance of 5%, but most of the rebalancing is going to occur as contributions go in or withdrawals go out.
9

Portfolio Management Verdict: Merrill Guided Investing

Here again, there is not much daylight between these two. E*TRADE has a very clear approach to rebalancing, which is good, but Merrill actually takes synced accounts into consideration when managing your account. This is rare for a robo-advisor and gives Merrill the edge here.

Tax-Advantaged Investing

Merrill Guided Investing does not provide tax-loss harvesting services. Merrill Guided Investing does have tax-aware portfolios that it will place investors in to minimize income with tax-advantaged investments.
10
 E*TRADE Core Portfolios include a component of tax-sensitive strategy in the portfolios it offers. This tax sensitivity includes the addition of municipal bonds in the portfolio, which offer beneficial tax treatment to offset the impact of taxable gains. E*TRADE Core Portfolios also added tax-loss harvesting recently and monitors daily for opportunities to realize losses to offset gains in other parts of the portfolio.

Tax-Advantaged Investing Verdict: E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios has a clear edge over Merrill Guided Investing by offering tax-sensitive portfolio construction and tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

Security

Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios both use heavy-duty 256-bit SSL encryption and client funds are held in-house at both brokerages. Both platforms are part of large financial institutions that provide Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and private excess insurance. Also, state-of-the-art fingerprint, face recognition, and two-factor authentication capabilities are available in mobile apps at both brokerages.

Security Verdict: Tie

Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios use effective security with no differentiation between them. Your money is safe at either of these firms.

User Experience
Desktop

Both brokerage platforms are feature-rich resources available to clients who have opened a robo-advisor account. Each has a wide array of technical analysis tools as well as reports on fundamental measures. Both platforms have gone through years of customer feedback and refinement and are highly useful to the curious investor.

Mobile App

The mobile apps made available from these brokerages are both filled with useful features. E*TRADE’s mobile app was selected by Investopedia as the best for mobile users, where it was praised for being very similar to its desktop counterpart. Its organization and style make it a useful tool for the on-the-go investor. 

While its technical research function is a bit less fluid, the Merrill app has a surprisingly beneficial aspect to its design. It is oriented around the “story” of an individual security. This thematic arrangement of information is less intimidating and creates rapid familiarity for the casual user or beginning investor. 

Customer Service

Both brokerages offer multiple access points for customer service, and both have similar strengths and weaknesses. Customers who enjoy using the mobile apps or desktop version can get their questions answered in comprehensive FAQs and help centers. Phone access to customer service reps is also available for 24 hours per day at both robo-advisors.

Customer Service Verdict: Tie

Both Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios lean heavily on the phone for tricky questions not covered in their comprehensive websites.

Fees
Merrill Guided Investing

Merrill Guided Investing requires at least $1,000 to get started and has a management fee of 0.45%. The online-plus-financial advisor program requires $20,000 in your account and has a higher 0.85% fee. The Preferred Rewards program can lower fees if you qualify, bringing the management fee down from 0.05% to 0.15%.
3
 The higher your account balance with Merrill and Bank of America, the larger the discount on the annual fee. Merrill Guided Investing customers pay the underlying fees for the funds, with expense ratios ranging from 0.05% to 0.16% depending on the portfolio.

E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE’s Core Portfolios accounts require at least $500 to open and have a management fee of 0.3%. In this fee structure, a $10,000 account would have an annual fee of just $30. Core Portfolios customers will also pay ETF expense ratios, which range from 0.05% for the Core offering to 0.14% for smart beta and 0.16% for SRI. 

Fees Verdict: E*TRADE Core Portfolios

E*TRADE Core Portfolios charges less of a headline management fee and has low underlying expense ratios. That said, Preferred Rewards can change the fee picture for Merrill/Bank of America customers, as can a promotional six-month waiver of fees that Merrill Guided Investing currently has.

Fees	Merrill Guided Investing 	E*TRADE Core Portfolios
Management Fees for $5,000 Account	$22.50	$15
Management Fees for $25,000 Account 	$112.50 (Plus Advisor $212.50)	$75

The Bottom Line

Both Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios are successful at simplifying investment decisions for those looking for a set-it-and-forget-it solution. Both offer well-constructed portfolios. E*TRADE Core Portfolio includes rules-based rebalancing for the purpose of keeping the allocations consistent with their recommended targets and tax-loss harvesting. Merrill Guided Investing offers situational rebalancing with the intent that it will optimize the performance of the portfolio. E*TRADE Core Portfolios offers lower costs and a better mobile experience for beginners with smaller accounts, while Merrill offers better goal planning. 

The target customers for Merrill Guided Investing and E*TRADE Core Portfolios are customers who are already in their financial ecosystem. Looking solely at the robo-advisors misses the larger wrap-around ecosystem of services that the companies don't need to bother replicating within the robo-advisor itself. This includes cash management, loans, net-worth analysis, and so on. If you are already with one of these firms, then its respective robo-advisor is the natural choice. If you aren't, then it is worth broadening your search to other services with stronger goal-planning support and cheaper fees.

Is Merrill Guided Investing Worth It?

Merrill Guided Investing is worth it for investors looking for a way to automate their investments. Merrill offers situational rebalancing that will help you optimize the performance of your portfolio. However, if you have a low balance when opening your account, you'll find the fees higher than other robo-advisor options (though the fees even out as your balance grows). Compare all the best robo-advisors before deciding which one is worth it.

How Do You Cancel Your E*TRADE Core Portfolio?

E*TRADE does not offer educational information on its website on how to cancel or close your Core Portfolios account. You can call E*TRADE Core Portfolio's customer service department at 866-484-3658. A specialist should be available when a customer needs assistance.

How We Review Robo-Advisors

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We used our 2023 consumer survey to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 robo-advisor awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 64 questions to each of the 21 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Jan. 8 to Feb. 9, 2024.

We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 59 criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:

Goal Planning - 21.00%
Portfolio Contents - 17.00%
Portfolio Management - 17.00%
Fees - 15.00%
Account Services - 10.00%
Security & Education - 5.00%
User Experience - 5.00%
Account Setup - 5.00%
Customer Service - 5.00%

Additionally, during our 2023 research, many of the companies we reviewed granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.

Read more about how we research and review robo-advisors.


Separately, our research team conducted a survey of 205 U.S. adults aged 18 to 72 who are current clients of one of 18 robo-advisors. While the information collected did not influence the development of our ratings model, it was instrumental in gathering the valuable insights published in Investopedia's 2023 Robo-Advisor Consumer Survey.

Participants in our 2023 Robo-Advisor Survey opted in to an online, self-administered questionnaire from a market research vendor. Data collection took place between Aug. 30 and Sept. 15, 2023, with 11 video interviews conducted with volunteer respondents from Sept. 7 to Sept. 17, 2023. Multiple quality checks, including screeners, attention gauges, comprehension evaluations, and logic metrics, among others, were used to ensure only the highest quality responses were included."

Here's how to set financial independence goals and achieve them, whether you want to retire early, live abroad, or reduce stress.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-achieve-financial-independence-8647093,"A growing number of women say that achieving financial independence is their No. 1 financial goal, according to a Fidelity Investments Survey. Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money.

However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense. 

Whether you're hoping to go full FIRE (financial independence, retire early) or just want to feel more on top of your expenses and planning, this guide will offer practical steps to get you where you want to go.

What Is Financial Independence?

“Financial independence means different things to different people,” says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. “Some see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.” 

Russell continues, “For some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.”

No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences.

Financial Self-Sufficiency

At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. 

For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less—even with three kids in tow. 

“[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,"" says Brock Waterman. 

After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. 

Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. 

While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer.

Freedom From Employment

Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans.

“Investing 10-15% of gross income for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,” says Anna N’Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence.  

While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings.

Autonomy Over Amounts

Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too.

“Many financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,” she says.

Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. “When we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,” he says. 

After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care.  

Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal.

Building Long-Term Security

Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don’t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don’t.

For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. 

“They'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,” Waterman explains. 

Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. 

“Focus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,” he advises. “High-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent financial management and investment strategies.” 

Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul.

Why Women Can Benefit Greatly From Financial Independence

While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities.

According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350.

REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's survey data shows a gender wage gap within marriages, too: 60% percent of women respondents with a male partner said that they earned less than their significant other. 


While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. 

Women Live Longer 

The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,  life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women in the United States and 74 years for men. This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. 

According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man. Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs.

Navigating Caregiving Duties

“With added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,” Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents.

A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000. Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments, lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men.

Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers. So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. 

10 Steps to Financial Independence

Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey.

Step 1: Define Your ""Why""

Defining your ""why"" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path.

Step 2: Assess Your Finances

Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence.

To assess your current financial situation: 

Start by tallying your monthly income from all sources, including your salary, side hustles, and any passive income streams. 
Next, list out your monthly expenses, making sure to account for both fixed costs like rent or mortgage payments, as well as variable expenses such as groceries and entertainment. 
Don't forget to factor in one-off annual bills, such as insurance premiums or property taxes, as these can significantly impact your overall financial picture.

Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages.

To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning.

Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time.

Step 3: Craft Your Financial Independence (FI) Number

Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number—an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions.

To determine this:

Estimate your annual retirement living expenses
Factor one-time goals like buying property
Increase for expected inflation over time
Calculate investable assets needed to generate that income

Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target.

Step 4: Automate Saving and Investing

“For individuals aspiring to achieve financial independence through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,” says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.” 

Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth. “Rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with financial goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to financial independence,” he adds.

He says investing may require the help of a team—a financial advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney—whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner.

Alternatively, DIY apps like Acorns, Betterment, Ellevest, and Wealthfront, among many others, offer set-it-and-forget-it retirement investing convenience.

Step 5: Create a Debt Repayment Plan

Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn’t derail the dream. 

“Achieving financial independence while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,” says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between “good” debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and ""bad"" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. 

Russell says, “Prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance financial security and accelerate the journey to independence.”

Minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can help with financial independence.

To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods:

Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid.

Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts.

Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first.

Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress.

Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free.

Step 6: Keep a Realistic Emergency Savings Fund

Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit.

Most experts advise stockpiling enough emergency savings to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. And whenever funds are low or living expenses increase, the savings target should shift to replenishment. 

Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap. Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. 

Step 7: Maximize Your Human Capital

Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms.

Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. 

Step 8: Build Multiple Income Streams

As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages:

Side hustles: Start a weekend freelancing business doing what you love. Drive for a rideshare service in your spare time. Monetize a hobby or talent.
Online businesses: Launch a digital product, YouTube channel, affiliate marketing blog, or dropshipping store. Multiple streams leveraging the internet scale easily.
Real estate: Invest in a rental property you can hire a manager to oversee. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) provide more passive real estate investing exposure too.
Equity investments: Build a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), etc. over time. Dividends and appreciation compound as the principal grows.

Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow.

Step 9: Manage Costs and Practice Intentional Spending

Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they’re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for.

“You can be very ruthless … don't spend money if it's not important to you,” says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? 

It's helpful to ask yourself, ""What will this purchase contribute to my life?"" before buying.

For the Watermans, traveling isn’t a luxury. It’s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper “why” and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans.

Step 10: Continuously Educate Yourself

Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How Long Does It Take to Achieve Financial Independence?

Timelines vary substantially based on factors like income, frugality, market returns, inheritance windfalls, etc. However, truly achieving FI generally takes decades for the average person.

The key is avoiding short-term scorekeeping and instead focusing on the right money mindsets and behaviors consistency over long time horizons. Marathon mentality perseveres.

Can You Still Become Financially Independent With Kids?

Absolutely! Children do reduce the free cash flow available to invest and delay retirement timelines. However, by sticking to financial independence principles and adjusting savings rates accordingly, parenthood and financial freedom can thrive together.

The key is balancing enjoying special moments with kids today while also sacrificing to fund their futures responsibly. Delayed life milestones like buying a bigger home may be needed but compound investing makes larger catch-up contributions later possible too.

What if Your Significant Other Isn’t on Board?

Pursuing financial independence often requires trade-offs and sacrifices that partners may not embrace or understand initially. Try framing benefits in terms of how achieving FI together unlocks greater family time and potential.

Start where you agree—identify shared dreams, areas of financial stress, and lifestyle upgrades you both want. Pursue small joint money wins together first before tackling bigger mindset shifts. Leading by example also influences over time.

Can Unexpected Events Derail Your Progress?

Job loss, health care issues, and market downturns happen. Life's hiccups test financial discipline and scrappy resilience. Having emergency savings, insurance protections and diverse income streams helps weather storms without surrendering long-term financial independence aims.

Remember, obstacles are inevitable. Progress over perfect financial steps moves you forward despite setbacks.

How Do Taxes Impact Financial Independence?

It's wise to take taxes into account but avoiding investing simply due to tax considerations means leaving substantial wealth unrealized. Focus first on maximizing returns through prudent investing based on risk, fees, diversification, etc.

Once assets grow, work with a financial advisor to legally minimize taxes where possible—contributing to retirement accounts, realizing losses, gifting appreciated assets, etc. Reducing taxes sustains more compound capital working toward your financial independence.

The Bottom Line

The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There’s more than one way to do this.

“I think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,” advises Konte. “In my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.” 

Russell reiterates that “while a high income can expedite financial independence, it's not a prerequisite.” Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families.

Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

Brexit is a portmanteau of the words “British” and “exit” that was coined to refer to the United Kingdom’s decision in a June 23, 2016, referendum to leave the European Union (EU). Brexit took place at 11 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Jan. 31, 2020.1

On Dec. 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU struck a provisional free-trade agreement ensuring the free trade of goods without tariffs or quotas. However, key details of the future relationship remain uncertain, such as trade in services, which make up 80% of the U.K. economy. This prevented a no-deal Brexit, which would have been significantly damaging to the U.K. economy.

A provisional agreement was approved by the U.K. parliament on Jan. 1, 2021. It was approved by the European Parliament on April 28, 2021. While the deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), allowed tariff- and quota-free trade in goods, U.K.-EU trade still faces customs checks. This means that commerce is not as smooth as when the U.K. was a member of the EU.231

The Referendum

The Leave side won the June 2016 referendum with 51.9% of the ballot, or 17.4 million votes, while Remain received 48.1% or 16.1 million votes. Voter turnout was 72.2%. The results were tallied on a U.K.-wide basis, but the overall figures conceal stark regional differences: 53.4% of English voters supported Brexit, compared to just 38% of Scottish voters.4

Because England accounts for the vast majority of the U.K.’s population, support there swayed the result in Brexit’s favor. If the vote were conducted only in Wales (where Leave voters also won), Scotland, and Northern Ireland, Brexit would have received less than 45% of the vote.5

The result defied expectations and roiled global markets, causing the British pound to fall to its lowest level against the dollar in 30 years.6

Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum and campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the EU, announced his resignation the following day. He was replaced as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister by Theresa May in July 2016.7

The Article 50 Negotiating Period

The process of leaving the EU formally began on March 29, 2017, when May triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. initially had two years from that date to negotiate a new relationship with the EU.8

Following a snap election on June 8, 2017, May remained the country’s leader. However, the Conservatives lost their outright majority in Parliament and agreed on a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. This later caused May some difficulty getting her Withdrawal Agreement passed in Parliament.910

Talks began on June 19, 2017. Questions swirled around the process, partly because Britain’s constitution is unwritten and because no country had left the EU using Article 50 before. A similar move happened, though, when Algeria left the EU’s predecessor after gaining independence from France in 1962, and Greenland, which was a self-governing territory, left Denmark through a special treaty in 1985.11

On Nov. 25, 2018, Britain and the EU agreed on a 599-page Withdrawal Agreement, a Brexit deal that touched upon issues such as citizens’ rights, the divorce bill, and the Irish border. Parliament first voted on this agreement on Jan. 15, 2019. Members of Parliament voted 432 to 202 to reject the agreement, the biggest defeat for a government in the House of Commons in recent history.1213

May stepped down as party leader on June 7, 2019, after failing three times to get the deal she negotiated with the EU approved by the House of Commons. The following month, Boris Johnson, a former mayor of London, foreign minister, and editor of The Spectator, was elected prime minister.14

Johnson, a hardline Brexit supporter, campaigned on a platform to leave the EU by the October deadline “do or die” and said he was prepared to leave the EU without a deal. The U.K. and EU negotiators agreed on a new divorce deal on Oct. 17. The main difference from May’s deal was that the Irish backstop clause was replaced with a new arrangement.15

Another historic moment occurred in August 2019, when Johnson requested that the queen suspend Parliament from mid-September until Oct. 14, and she approved. This was seen as a ploy to stop members of Parliament from blocking a chaotic exit, and some even called it a coup of sorts. The U.K. Supreme Court’s 11 judges unanimously deemed the move unlawful on Sept. 24 and reversed it.1617

The negotiating period also led Britain’s political parties to face their own crises. Lawmakers left both the Conservative and Labour parties in protest. There were allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticized for his handling of the issue. In September, Johnson expelled 21 MPs for voting to delay Brexit.1819

The U.K. was expected to leave the EU by Oct. 31, 2019, but Parliament voted to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline and delayed a vote on the new deal.20

Johnson then called for a general election. In the Dec. 12 election, the third general election in less than five years, Johnson’s Conservative Party won a huge majority of 365 seats in the House of Commons out of 650 seats. It managed this despite receiving only 43.6% of the vote due to its opponents being fractured between multiple parties.21

Brexit Negotiations

Britain’s lead negotiator in the talks with Brussels was David Davis. He was a Yorkshire member of Parliament (MP) until July 9, 2018, when he resigned. He was replaced by housing minister Dominic Raab as Brexit secretary. Raab resigned in protest over May’s deal on Nov. 15, 2018. He was replaced by health and social care minister Stephen Barclay the following day.

The EU’s chief negotiator was Michel Barnier, a French politician.

Preparatory talks exposed divisions in the two sides’ approaches to the process. The U.K. wanted to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal alongside the terms of its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, while Brussels wanted to make sufficient progress on divorce terms by October 2017, only then moving on to a trade deal. In a concession that both pro- and anti-Brexit commentators took as a sign of weakness, U.K. negotiators accepted the EU’s sequenced approach.

Citizens’ Rights

One of the most politically thorny issues faced by Brexit negotiators was the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and U.K. citizens living in the EU.

The Withdrawal Agreement allowed for the free movement of EU and U.K. citizens until the end of the transition or implementation period. Citizens were allowed to keep their residency rights if they continued to work, had sufficient resources, or were related to someone who did. To upgrade their residence status to permanent, they had to apply to the host nation. The rights of these citizens were revocable if Britain left without ratifying a deal.22

“EU net migration, while still adding to the population as a whole, has fallen to a level last seen in 2009. We are also now seeing more EU8 citizens—those from Central and Eastern European countries, for example, Poland—leaving the U.K. than arriving,” said Jay Lindop, director of the Centre for International Migration, in a government quarterly report released in February 2019.23

Britain’s government fought over the rights of EU citizens to remain in the U.K. after Brexit, publicly airing domestic divisions over migration. Following the referendum and Cameron’s resignation, May’s government concluded that it had the right under the “royal prerogative” to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal withdrawal process on its own.

The U.K. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Parliament had to authorize the measure, and the House of Lords amended the resulting bill to guarantee the rights of EU-born residents. The House of Commons, which had a Tory majority at the time, struck the amendment down, and the unamended bill became law on March 16, 2017.

Conservative opponents of the amendment argued that unilateral guarantees eroded Britain’s negotiating position, while those in favor of it said EU citizens should not be used as bargaining chips.

Some of the economic concerns included the fact that EU migrants were greater contributors to the economy than their U.K. counterparts. Leave supporters, though, read the data as pointing to foreign competition for scarce jobs in Britain.24

Brexit Financial Settlement

The Brexit bill was the financial settlement that the U.K. owed Brussels following its withdrawal.

The Withdrawal Agreement didn’t mention a specific figure, but it was estimated to be up to £32.8 billion, according to Downing Street. The total sum included the financial contribution that the U.K. would make during the transition period because it was an EU member state and owed a contribution toward the EU’s outstanding 2020 budget commitments.25

The U.K. also received funding from EU programs during the transition period and a share of its assets at the end of it, which included the capital it paid to the European Investment Bank (EIB).

A December 2017 agreement resolved this long-standing sticking point that threatened to derail negotiations entirely. Barnier’s team launched the first volley in May 2017 with the release of a document listing the 70-odd entities it would take into account when tabulating the bill. The initial estimate of the bill was €100 billion. Net of certain U.K. assets, the final bill would be €25 billion to €65 billion.”2627

Davis’ team, meanwhile, refused EU demands to submit the U.K.’s preferred methodology for tallying the bill. In August, he told the BBC he would not commit to a figure by October, the deadline for assessing “sufficient progress” on issues such as the bill.28

The following month, he told the House of Commons that Brexit bill negotiations could go on “for the full duration of the negotiation.”29

Davis presented this refusal to the House of Lords as a negotiating tactic, but domestic politics probably explained his reticence. Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit, called EU estimates “extortionate” on July 11, 2017, and agreed with a Tory MP that Brussels could “go whistle” if they wanted “a penny.”30

In her September 2017 speech in Florence, Italy, however, May said the U.K. would “honor commitments we have made during the period of our membership.” Barnier confirmed to reporters in October 2019 that Britain would pay what was owed.31

The Northern Irish Border

The new Withdrawal Agreement replaced the controversial Irish backstop provision with a protocol. According to the revised deal, the entire U.K. left the EU customs union upon Brexit, but Northern Ireland continued following EU regulations and value-added tax (VAT) laws for goods, while the U.K. government collected the VAT on behalf of the EU.

This meant there was a limited customs border in the Irish Sea with checks at major ports. The Northern Ireland assembly can vote on this arrangement up to four years after the end of the transition period.

The backstop emerged as the main reason for the Brexit impasse. It was a guarantee that there was no “hard border” between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It was an insurance policy that kept Britain in the EU customs union with Northern Ireland following EU single-market rules.32

The backstop, which was meant to be temporary and was superseded by a subsequent agreement, could only be removed if both Britain and the EU gave their consent.32

May was unable to garner enough support for her deal due to it. Euroskeptic MPs wanted her to add legally binding changes, as they feared it would compromise the country’s autonomy and could last indefinitely. EU leaders refused to remove it and ruled out a time limit on granting Britain the power to remove it. On March 11, 2019, the two sides signed a pact in Strasbourg, France, that did not change the Withdrawal Agreement but added “meaningful legal assurances.” But it wasn’t enough to convince hardline Brexiteers.33

For decades during the second half of the 20th century, violence between Protestants and Catholics marred Northern Ireland and the border between the U.K. countryside and the Republic of Ireland to the south was militarized. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement turned the border almost invisible, except for speed limit signs, which switch from miles per hour in the north to kilometers per hour in the south. 

Negotiators in the U.K. and EU worried about the consequences of reinstating border controls, as Britain had to do in order to end freedom of movement from the EU. Yet leaving the customs union without imposing customs checks at the Northern Irish border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain left the door wide open for smuggling. This significant and unique challenge was one of the reasons soft Brexit advocates cited in favor of staying in the EU’s customs union and perhaps its single market.

The issue was further complicated by the Tories’ choice of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party as a coalition partner. The party opposed the Good Friday Agreement and, unlike the Conservative leader at the time, campaigned for Brexit.34

Under the Good Friday Agreement, the U.K. government was required to oversee Northern Ireland with “rigorous impartiality.” That proved difficult for a government that depended on the cooperation of a party with an overwhelmingly Protestant support base and historical connections to Protestant paramilitary groups.34

Arguments for and Against Brexit

Leave voters based their support for Brexit on a variety of factors, including the European debt crisis, immigration, terrorism, and the perceived drag of Brussels’ bureaucracy on the U.K. economy.

Britain was wary of the European Union’s projects, which Leave supporters felt threatened the U.K.’s sovereignty; the country never opted into the European Union’s monetary union, meaning that it used the pound instead of the euro. It also remained outside the Schengen Area, meaning that it did not share open borders with a number of other European nations.35

Opponents of Brexit also cited a number of rationales for their position:

The risk involved in pulling out of the EU’s decision-making process, given that it was the largest destination for U.K. exports
The economic and societal benefits of the EU’s four freedoms: the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people across borders

A common thread in both arguments was that leaving the EU would destabilize the U.K. economy in the short term and make the country poorer in the long term.

In July 2018, May’s cabinet suffered another shake-up when Boris Johnson resigned as the U.K.’s foreign minister and David Davis resigned as Brexit minister over May’s plans to keep close ties to the EU. Johnson was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who favored a soft Brexit.36

Some state institutions backed the Remain supporters’ economic arguments: Bank of England governor Mark Carney called Brexit “the biggest domestic risk to financial stability” in March 2016, and the following month, the Treasury projected lasting damage to the economy under any of three possible post-Brexit scenarios:

European Economic Area (EEA) membership

Adapted from “H.M. Treasury analysis: The long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives,” April 201639

Leave supporters discounted such economic projections under the label “Project Fear.” A pro-Brexit outfit associated with the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), which was founded to oppose EU membership, responded by saying that the Treasury’s “worst-case scenario of £4,300 per household is a bargain-basement price for the restoration of national independence and safe, secure borders.”40

Although Leave supporters stressed issues of national pride, safety, and sovereignty, they also mustered economic arguments. For example, Johnson said on the eve of the vote, “EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal” the day after the vote, in light of their “commercial interests.”41

Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, topped the “Why Vote Leave” page on its website with the claim that the U.K. could save £350 million per week: “We can spend our money on our priorities like the NHS [National Health Service], schools, and housing.”42

In May 2016, the U.K. Statistics Authority, an independent public body, said the figure was gross rather than net, which was “misleading and undermines trust in official statistics.” A mid-June poll by Ipsos MORI, however, found that 47% of the country believed the claim.4344

The day after the referendum, Nigel Farage, who co-founded UKIP and led it until that November, disavowed the figure and said that he was not closely associated with Vote Leave. May also declined to confirm Vote Leave’s NHS promises since taking office.45

Brexit Economic Response

Though Britain officially left the EU, 2020 was a transition and implementation period. Trade and customs continued during that time, so there wasn’t much on a day-to-day basis that seemed different to U.K. residents. Even so, the decision to leave the EU had an effect on Britain’s economy.

The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to around 1.4% in 2018 from 1.9% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017 as business investment slumped. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the country’s economy would grow at 1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. Instead, growth was 1.6% in 2019 but -10.4% in 2020. GDP rebounded, however, touching 8.7% in 2021 before slowing to 4.3% in 2022.4647

The U.K. unemployment rate hit a 44-year low at 3.9% in the three months leading up to January 2019. Experts attribute this to employers preferring to retain workers instead of investing in new major projects.48

While the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote helped exporters, the higher price of imports was passed onto consumers and had a significant impact on the annual inflation rate. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit 3.1% in the 12 months leading up to November 2017, a nearly six-year high that well exceeded the Bank of England’s 2% target. Inflation fell in 2018 with the decline in oil and gas prices but soared after the global COVID-19 pandemic, rising 8.7% in the 12 months preceding April 2023.4950

A July 2017 report by the House of Lords cited evidence that U.K. businesses would have to raise wages to attract native-born workers following Brexit, which was “likely to lead to higher prices for consumers.”51

International trade was expected to fall due to Brexit, even with the possibility of a raft of free trade deals. Dr. Monique Ebell, former associate research director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, forecasted a -22% reduction in total U.K. goods and services trade if EU membership was replaced by a free trade agreement.

Other free trade agreements were not predicted to pick up the slack. In fact, Ebell saw a pact with the BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) boosting total trade by 2.2% while a pact with the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand was expected to do slightly better, at 2.6%.52

“The single market is a very deep and comprehensive trade agreement aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers,” Ebell wrote in January 2017, “while most non-EU [free trade agreements] seem to be quite ineffective at reducing the non-tariff barriers that are important for services trade.”52

June 2017 General Election

On April 18, May called for a snap election to be held on June 8, despite previous promises not to hold one until 2020. Polling at the time suggested May would expand on her slim Parliament majority of 330 seats (there are 650 seats in the Commons). Labour gained rapidly in the polls, however, aided by an embarrassing Tory flip-flop on a proposal for estates to fund end-of-life care.

The Conservatives lost their majority, winning 318 seats to Labour’s 262. The Scottish National Party won 35, with other parties taking 35. The resulting hung Parliament cast doubts on May’s mandate to negotiate Brexit and led the leaders of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to call on May to resign.53

Speaking in front of the prime minister’s residence at 10 Downing Street, May batted away calls for her to leave her post, saying, “It is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party”—the Tories’ official name—“has the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons.” The Conservatives struck a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats, to form a coalition.54

May presented the election as a chance for the Conservatives to solidify their mandate and strengthen their negotiating position with Brussels. But this backfired.

In the wake of the election, many expected the government’s Brexit position to soften, and they were right. May released a Brexit white paper in July 2018 that mentioned an “association agreement” and a free-trade area for goods with the EU. David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest.55

But the election also increased the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The Financial Times predicted that the result made May more vulnerable to pressure from Euroskeptics and her coalition partners. This was evident with the Irish backstop tussle.56

With her position weakened, May struggled to unite her party behind her deal and keep control of Brexit.

Scotland’s Independence Referendum

Politicians in Scotland pushed for a second independence referendum in the wake of the Brexit vote, but the results of the June 8, 2017, election cast a pall over their efforts. The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost 21 seats in the Westminster Parliament, and on June 27, 2017, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government at Holyrood would “reset” its timetable on independence to focus on delivering a “soft Brexit.”57

Not one Scottish local area voted to leave the EU, according to the U.K.’s Electoral Commission, though Moray came close at 49.9%. The country as a whole rejected the referendum by 62.0% to 38.0%.58

But because Scotland only contains 8.4% of the U.K.’s population, its vote to Remain (along with that of Northern Ireland, which accounts for just 2.8% of the U.K.’s population) was vastly outweighed by support for Brexit in England and Wales.

Scotland joined England and Wales to form Great Britain in 1707, and the relationship has been tumultuous at times. The SNP, which was founded in the 1930s, had just six of 650 seats in Westminster in 2010. The following year, however, it formed a majority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, partly owing to its promise to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.

2014 Scottish Independence Referendum

That referendum, held in 2014, saw the pro-independence side lose with 44.7% of the vote. Turnout was 84.6%. Far from putting the independence issue to rest, though, the vote fired up nationalist support.59

The SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster the following year, overtaking the Liberal Democrats to become the third-largest party in the U.K. overall. Britain’s electoral map suddenly showed a glaring divide between England and Wales, which was dominated by Tory blue with the occasional patch of Labour red, and all-yellow Scotland.

When Britain voted to leave the EU, Scotland fulminated. A combination of rising nationalism and strong support for Europe led almost immediately to calls for a new independence referendum. In 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled that devolved national assemblies such as Scotland’s parliament could not veto Brexit, the demands grew louder.

On March 13 of that year, Sturgeon called for a second referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. Holyrood backed her by a vote of 69 to 59 on March 28, the day before May’s government triggered Article 50.

Sturgeon’s preferred timing was significant since the two-year countdown initiated by Article 50 ended in the spring of 2019 when the politics surrounding Brexit could be particularly volatile.

What Would Independence Look Like?

Scotland’s economic situation also raised questions about its hypothetical future as an independent country. The crash in oil prices dealt a blow to government finances. In May 2014, its government forecasted 2015–2016 tax receipts from North Sea drilling of £3.4 billion to £9 billion but only collected £60 million, less than 1% of the forecasts’ midpoint.

In reality, these figures were hypothetical since Scotland’s finances were not (and are not) fully devolved, but the estimates were based on the country’s geographical share of North Sea drilling, so they illustrated what it might expect as an independent nation.

The debate over what currency an independent Scotland would use was revived. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland’s First Minister until November 2014, told the Financial Times that the country could abandon the pound and introduce its own currency, allowing it to float freely or pegging it to sterling. He ruled out joining the euro, but others contended that it would be required for Scotland to join the EU. Another possibility would be to use the pound, which would mean forfeiting control over monetary policy.60

Upsides for Some

On the other hand, a weak currency that floats on global markets can be a boon to U.K. producers that export goods. Industries that rely heavily on exports could actually see some benefit.

In 2024, the top 10 exports from the U.K. were (in U.S. dollars):

Precious metals: $63.5 billion
Motor vehicle manufacturing: $28.8
Aircraft, engines, and parts manufacturing: $27.4 billion
Petroleum refining: $21.4 billion
Pharmaceuticals preparations manufacturing: $15.4 billion
Crude petroleum and natural gas extraction: $12.8 billion
Off-road vehicle manufacturing: $8.9 billion
Measuring, testing, and navigational equipment manufacturing: $8.4 billion
Spirit Production: $6.9 billion

Whiskey production: $5.8 billion61

Some sectors were prepared to benefit from the exit. Multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 saw earnings rise as a result of a soft pound. A weak currency was also a boon to the tourism, energy, and service industries.

In May 2016, the State Bank of India, India’s largest commercial bank, suggested that Brexit would benefit India economically. While leaving the eurozone meant that the U.K. no longer had unfettered access to Europe’s single market, it would allow for more focus on trade with India. India would also have more wiggle room if the U.K. were no longer under European trade rules and regulations.62

U.K.-EU Trade After Brexit

May advocated a “hard Brexit.” By that, she meant that Britain should leave the EU’s single market and customs union and negotiate a trade deal to govern their future relationship. These negotiations would have been conducted during a transition period once a divorce deal was ratified.

The Conservatives’ poor showing in the June 2017 snap election called popular support for a hard Brexit into question. Many in the press speculated that the government could take a softer line. The Brexit White Paper released in July 2018 revealed plans for a softer Brexit. It was too soft for many MPs in her party and too audacious for the EU.63

The white paper said the government planned to leave the EU single market and customs union. However, it proposed the creation of a free trade area for goods, which would “avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and mean that businesses would not need to complete costly customs declarations. And it would enable products to only undergo one set of approvals and authorizations in either market, before being sold in both.” This meant the U.K. would follow EU single-market rules regarding goods.64

The white paper acknowledged that a borderless customs arrangement with the EU—one that allowed the U.K. to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries—was “broader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country.”65

The government was correct that there was no example of this kind of relationship in Europe. The four broad precedents that existed were the EU’s relationship with Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and WTO members.

The Norway Model: Join the EEA

The first option was for the U.K. to join Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in the European Economic Area (EEA), which provides access to the EU’s single market for most goods and services (agriculture and fisheries are excluded). At the same time, the EEA is outside the customs union, so Britain could have entered into trade deals with non-EU countries.

But the arrangement was hardly a win-win. The U.K. would be bound by some EU laws while losing its ability to influence those laws through the country’s European Council and European Parliament voting rights. In September 2017, May called this arrangement an unacceptable “loss of democratic control.”31

David Davis expressed interest in the Norway model in response to a question he received at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. “It’s something we’ve thought about, but it’s not at the top of our list,” he said. He was referring specifically to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which, like the EEA, offers access to the single market but not the customs union.66

The EFTA was once a large organization, but most of its members left to join the EU. Today, it comprises Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland; all but Switzerland are also members of the EEA.

The Switzerland Model

Switzerland’s relationship with the EU, which is governed by around 20 major bilateral pacts with the bloc, is broadly similar to the EEA arrangement. Along with these three, Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association. Switzerland helped set up the EEA, but its people rejected membership in a 1992 referendum.

The country allows the free movement of people and is a member of the passport-free Schengen Area. It is subject to many single-market rules without having much say in making them.

It is outside the customs union, allowing it to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries; usually, but not always, it has negotiated alongside the EEA countries. Switzerland has access to the single market for goods (with the exception of agriculture) but not services (except insurance). It pays a modest amount into the EU’s budget. 

Brexit supporters who wanted to “take back control” wouldn’t have embraced the concessions that the Swiss made on immigration, budget payments, and single-market rules. The EU would probably not have wanted a relationship modeled on the Swiss example, either: Switzerland’s membership in the EFTA but not the EEA, and Schengen but not the EU, is a messy product of the complex history of European integration and—not surprisingly—a referendum.

The Canada Model: A Free Trade Agreement

A third option was to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU along the lines of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a pact that the EU finalized but didn’t fully ratify with Canada. The most obvious problem with this approach is that the U.K. had only two years from triggering Article 50 to negotiate such a deal. The EU refused to discuss a future trading relationship until December of that year at the earliest.

To give a sense of how tight that timetable was, CETA negotiations began in 2009 and concluded in 2014. But just over half of the EU’s 28 national parliaments ratified the deal. Even subnational legislatures can stand in the way of a deal; the Walloon regional parliament, which represents fewer than four million mainly French-speaking Belgians, single-handedly blocked CETA for a few days in 2016.67

To extend the two-year deadline for leaving the EU, Britain needed unanimous approval from the EU. Several U.K. politicians, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, stressed the need for a transitional deal of a few years so that (among other reasons) Britain could negotiate EU and third-country trade deals. But this notion was met with resistance from hardline Brexiteers.68

As of 2024, all EU member countries have signed the agreement yet some still need to ratify it, a process that can take two to five years.6970

Problems With a CETA-Style Agreement

In some ways, comparing Britain’s situation to Canada’s is misleading. Canada already enjoys free trade with the U.S. through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was built on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This means that a trade deal with the EU was not as crucial as it is for the U.K. Canada’s and Britain’s economies are also very different—CETA does not include financial services, one of Britain’s biggest exports to the EU.

Speaking in Florence, Italy, in September 2017, May said the U.K. and EU “can do so much better” than a CETA-style trade agreement since they were beginning from the “unprecedented position” of sharing a body of rules and regulations. She did not elaborate on what “much better” looked like besides calling on both parties to be “creative as well as practical.”31

Monique Ebell, formerly of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, stressed that even with an agreement in place, non-tariff barriers were likely to be a significant drag on Britain’s trade with the EU. She expected total U.K. foreign trade—not just flows to and from the EU—under an EU-U.K. trade pact. She reasoned that free trade deals did not generally handle services trade well. Services are a major component of Britain’s international trade; the country enjoys a trade surplus in that segment, which is not the case for goods.

Free trade deals also struggle to rein in non-tariff barriers. Admittedly, Britain and the EU started from a unified regulatory scheme, but divergences would only multiply post-Brexit.52

WTO: Go It Alone

If Britain and the EU weren’t able to agree their relationship, they would have had to revert to WTO terms. But this default solution wouldn’t have been straightforward, either. Since Britain was a WTO member through the EU, it would have to split tariff schedules with the bloc and divvy out liabilities arising from ongoing trade disputes.

Trading with the EU on WTO terms was the “no-deal” scenario that the Conservative government presented as an acceptable fallback, though most observers see this as a negotiating tactic. In July 2017, U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said, “People talk about the WTO as if it would be the end of the world. But they forget that is how they currently trade with the United States, with China, with Japan, with India, with the Gulf, and our trading relationship is strong and healthy.”71

But for certain industries, the EU’s external tariff would have hit hard: Britain exports 77% of the cars it manufactures, and 58% of these go to Europe. The EU levies 10% tariffs on imported cars. Monique Ebell of the NIESR estimated that leaving the EU single market would reduce overall U.K. goods and services trade—not just that with the EU—by 22% to 30%.727352

Nor would the U.K. only be giving up its trade arrangements with the EU; under any of the scenarios above, it would probably have lost the trade agreements that the bloc struck with 63 developing countries, as well as progress in negotiating other deals. Replacing these and adding new ones would have been an uncertain prospect. In a September 2017 interview with Politico, Fox said his trade office, which was formed in July 2016, turned away some developing countries looking to negotiate free trade deals because it lacked the capacity to negotiate.74

Fox wanted to roll the terms of existing EU trade deals over into new agreements, but some countries were unwilling to give Britain (66 million people, $2.6 trillion GDP) the same terms as the EU (excluding Britain, around 440 million people, $13.9 trillion GDP).74

Impact on the U.S.

Companies in the U.S. across a wide variety of sectors have made large investments in the U.K. over many years. The U.S. hires a lot of Brits, making U.S. companies one of the U.K.’s largest job markets. The output of U.S. affiliates in the United Kingdom was $129.3 billion in 2021.75

The United Kingdom plays a vital role in corporate America’s global infrastructure, from assets under management (AUM) to international sales and research and development (R&D) advancements.

American companies have viewed Britain as a strategic gateway to other countries in the European Union. Brexit is believed to jeopardize the affiliate earnings and stock prices of many companies strategically aligned with the United Kingdom.

American companies and investors that have exposure to European banks and credit markets may be affected by credit risk. European banks may have to replace $123 billion in securities depending on how the exit unfolds. Furthermore, U.K. debt may not be included in European banks’ emergency cash reserves, creating liquidity problems. European asset-backed securities have been in decline since 2007.7677

Who’s Next to Leave the EU?

Political wrangling over the EU wasn’t limited to Britain. Even following Britain’s departure, most EU members had strong Euroskeptic movements that, while they struggled to win power at the national level, heavily influenced the tenor of national politics in the years that followed. There is still a chance that such movements could secure referendums on EU membership in a few countries at some point in the future.

In May 2016, global research firm Ipsos released a report showing that a majority of respondents in Italy and France believe their countries should hold a referendum on EU membership.78

Italy

The fragile Italian banking sector has driven a wedge between the EU and the Italian government, which provided bailout funds to save mom-and-pop bondholders from being “bailed in,” as EU rules stipulate. The government abandoned its 2019 budget when the EU threatened it with sanctions. It lowered its planned budget deficit from 2.5% of GDP to 2.04%.79

Matteo Salvini, the far-right head of Italy’s Northern League and the country’s deputy prime minister, called for a referendum on EU membership hours after the Brexit vote, saying, “This vote was a slap in the face for all those who say that Europe is their own business and Italians don’t have to meddle with that.”80 

The Northern League has an ally in the populist Five Star Movement, whose founder, former comedian Beppe Grillo, called for a referendum on Italy’s membership in the euro—though not the EU. The two parties formed a coalition government in 2018 and made Giuseppe Conte prime minister. Conte ruled out the possibility of “Italexit” in 2018 during the budget standoff.81

France

Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s Euroskeptic National Front, hailed the Brexit vote as a win for nationalism and sovereignty across Europe: “Like a lot of French people, I’m very happy that the U.K. people held on and made the right choice. What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible.” She lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in May 2017, gaining just 33.9% of votes. He won the election again in 2022, beating Le Pen once more.828384

Macron has warned that the demand for “Frexit” will grow if the EU does not see reforms. According to a 2020–2022 European Social Survey poll, 16% of French citizens want the country to leave the EU, down from 24.3% in a 2016–2017 poll.85

When Did Britain Officially Leave the European Union?

Britain officially left the EU on Jan. 31, 2020, at 11 p.m. GMT. The move came after a referendum voted in favor of Brexit on June 23, 2016.1

What Were the Reasons Behind Brexit?

There were many reasons why Britain voted to leave the European Union. But some of the main issues behind Brexit included a rise in nationalism, immigration, political autonomy, and the economy. The Leave side garnered almost 52% of the votes, while the Remain side received about 48%.4

How Many Countries Are Part of the EU Post-Brexit?

Britain’s departure from the European Union left 27 member states. They are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.86

The Bottom Line

The European Union was established in November 1993 with the Maastricht Treaty. The original members included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Fifteen other countries would gain membership in the union.

Rising nationalist sentiment, coupled with concerns over the economy and British sovereignty, led the majority of voters in the U.K. to vote to leave the EU. Britain left the union at the end of January 2020 in what is commonly called Brexit. But the move didn’t come without challenges. It required two years of negotiating a deal and a year-long transition period before everything became final."

The current top rate available for a high-yield savings account is 5.12% annual percentage yield (APY), with many accounts offering rates over 4.50%. Brokerage cash management accounts, also known as cash reserve accounts, currently top out at 5.00%.

Considering the Fed is widely expected to pause rate hikes at this week's policy meeting, it's likely we're at or approaching peak savings rates.1 That means rates on cash reserves and savings accounts probably won't go much higher. And since both types of accounts come with variable rates—meaning they can change at any time without warning—the main considerations for someone choosing one over the other are rates, deposit requirements, and the accessibility of funds.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Cash reserve account rates top out at 5.00% right now.
High-yield savings accounts are also around 5.00%, with the top rate sitting at 5.12% APY.
If you have cash in your brokerage account, you could leave it in the cash reserve account and capitalize on the interest there until you are ready to invest it.
If you need that money for something else, like an emergency, you may want to deposit it in a high-yield savings account.
Comparing Cash Reserve and Savings Account Rates

Rates on both cash reserves at brokerages and savings accounts have risen significantly in the last year, pushed up by the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate hikes to tame inflation. Though savers will find that savings accounts tend to pay better rates.

The highest-yielding savings account is currently from CFG Bank, which provides 5.12% APY with a minimum initial deposit of $1,000 and a $10 monthly fee. What's more, we found seven other accounts offering 5.00% or more, some with no minimum deposit and no monthly fees.

By comparison, the highest yield on cash reserves we found was the 4.65% Robinhood offers to Robinhood Gold subscribers, who pay $5 a month. Regular Robinhood customers earn 1.50% on their cash reserves.

Only a few other brokerages offer similar rates. Wealthfront's cash management account pays 4.55% and Betterment's pays 4.50%.23 More conventional brokerages tend to pay less, with Fidelity's cash management account offering 2.60% and Schwab's Bank Investor Savings Account providing 0.48%.45

Other Considerations for Choosing a Cash Reserve Account or a Savings Account

Cash reserve accounts are linked directly to brokerage accounts, offering depositors a quick and easy way to transfer funds from savings to investment accounts. There's also no limit on the number of transfers one can make between these accounts. Cash accounts often have low or no minimum balance requirements and fees, and they usually provide checks and free ATM access.

Another benefit of cash reserve accounts is the breadth of their Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 of customer funds at each institution where that customer banks.6 If an investor has more than $250,000 in their cash reserve account, their brokerage will often split the funds between multiple partner banks, ensuring the customer's funds never go uninsured.


High-yield savings accounts do not offer checks, and many are online-only, meaning they do not have ATM access. They are also not held with a brokerage, making the process of transferring funds into an investment account a little more arduous. Though these transfers are by no means hard and can usually be completed same-day. But keep in mind some high-yield savings accounts may limit the number of transfers a customer can make in a month without paying a penalty, which could raise the cost of transferring funds to make a quick trade.

current high-yield savings account interest rates comparison,investopedia,CD vs. Savings Account: What’s Smarter Right Now?,"Both CDs and high-yield savings accounts are paying record rates right now, with dozens of options that earn 5.00% or more. Find out how to choose what's best for you.",https://www.investopedia.com/cd-or-savings-account-whats-the-smarter-choice-right-now-7567858,"It's a lucky time to have savings in the bank. Thanks to the Federal Reserve's 17-month run-up in the federal funds rate, which drives the interest rates banks and credit unions offer, you can earn record-high yields on deposits, whether they're in a savings account, a certificate of deposit (CD), or both. So how should you choose?

What Pays More: CDs or Savings Accounts?

Typically, CDs pay higher interest rates than even high-yield savings accounts. That's because CDs require you to keep your funds committed for a set period of months or years. Banks and credit unions make up for that loss of flexibility by offering the incentive of a more attractive rate.

On the flip slide, you may earn a lower annual percentage yield (APY) by keeping your money in a savings account, but in return, you can withdraw funds or make additional deposits essentially anytime you like.

That said, a comparison between the best CD rates and the best high-yield savings accounts can get a bit more complicated. One reason is that there is not one set of top rates for all CDs, but rather top rates that vary by CD term. For instance, today's top savings account rates are lower than most of the best short- and mid-term CD rates. However, they pay more than the top long-term CDs.

The CD terms paying the highest yields fluctuate over time, however, since the rates banks and credit unions are willing to pay consumers is influenced not just by where rates are now, but by where they expect interest rates to move in the future. So when they think the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates down the road, they are less willing to promise high CD rates on long terms.

You can see this is playing out right now, in a period where the Fed has already aggressively raised the federal funds rate, but with the general expectation that rates will probably come down in 2024 or 2025. As a result, the best 6-month, 1-year and 18-month CDs are paying higher rates than the best high-yield savings accounts, but long-term options like 4-year and 5-year CDs are paying less.

Should You Lock Your Rate or Keep Your Funds Flexible?

If you have so much money in cash savings that you won't need any of it for several years down the road, the math is simple: Locking in one of today's record CD rates for three, four, or even five years is almost certainly going to earn you more than keeping it in a savings account. Here's why.

Savings and money market accounts pay a variable interest rate. That means the bank can change your rate at any time and without warning. Right now, interest rates are at record highs. But that party can't last forever. And when rates begin to come down in the future, your savings account rate will come down as well.

While the big advantage of CDs is that you can lock in a rate today and keep it for the full term of the CD, not everyone has money they can afford to tie up in a CD for a long time. So if you're not sure when you'll need to access your money, keeping it in a liquid savings or money market account can be smarter.

Pros and Cons: High-Yield Savings Accounts vs. CDs
	High-Yield Savings Accounts 	Certificates of Deposit 
Pros	• Let you withdraw at any time (sometimes with limits)
• Rates nearly as good as CDs right now	• Higher rates than savings accounts usually
• Fixed rate for the entire CD term—great when rates are falling
• Early withdrawal penalties may thwart the temptation to spend
Cons	• Don't earn quite as much as top-paying CDs
• APY can fall any time without notice
• Easier withdrawals may tempt you to spend	• if you need the money early for an emergency, you'll pay a penalty
• Most CDs don't let you add more to the account
• Fixed rate could cost you in a rising rate environment

One of the best options is the hybrid strategy. You move a portion of your savings you feel comfortable living without for a while into a CD with a term that feels reasonable to you. Then you keep the other portion of your funds in a high-yield savings account. When rates go down, you'll start earning less on the money in your savings account, but you'll be able to access it without worry, should you need it.

Why It's So Important to Shop Around

Whether you choose a CD, a high-yield savings account, or both, your smartest move is to shop around to find a top-paying option. The rates offered by your primary bank or credit union may be a fraction of what you can earn if you do your homework and open your account at another institution.

As you can see, the difference between the top rates in the country and the national averages is stark. You can earn three to five times more with a top CD, and as much as 12 times more with a top savings account than if you settle for an average rate.1

If you're considering a high-yield savings account for some of your funds, it's also smart to check the best money market accounts. Sometimes they pay more than the best savings accounts, but sometimes they pay less. The only real difference is that money market accounts offer check-writing, so if that's not a critical feature for you, your best move is to shop both types of accounts and choose whichever will pay you a higher APY.

How High Will Savings and CD Rates Go This Year?

On July 26, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate for the 11th time in 12 meetings, continuing its fast and furious campaign to combat decades-high inflation.2 Since March 2022, the central bank has raised its benchmark rate a cumulative 5.25%, taking the fed funds rate to its highest level since 2001. In turn, rates on all kinds of bank deposit accounts have surged over the last year and a half.

But where will rates go from here? The answer is that no one knows right now. The Fed has only signaled that it will take each rate-setting meeting one by one, and decide whether to further raise the fed funds rate or hold it steady after seeing the latest economic data.3 The Fed will not meet again until September 19-20, meaning the current benchmark rate will stay steady at its current level for another seven weeks at least.2

With the Fed's July increase less than a week in the rearview mirror, some banks and credit unions are expected to nudge their savings and CD rates a bit higher in coming weeks. But the impact will probably be minor, since the latest Fed increase was small compared to the massive hikes of 2022.

If the Fed opts in September—or at a later 2023 meeting—to raise the federal funds rate again, it's reasonable to assume bank and credit union deposit rates will inch a little higher still. But it's too soon to reliably predict what the Fed will do in those meetings.

At some point further down the road, it will become clear that the Fed has reached the end of its rate hikes and will hold its benchmark rate steady before ultimately lowering it. When that signal comes through, you can expect savings account and CD rates to begin their decline.

What Is a Checking Account?

A checking account is an account held at a financial institution that allows you to make credit and debit transactions. These accounts can offer both a debit card and check-writing capabilities.

Withdrawals can take the form of cash withdrawals made at a branch or an automated teller machine (ATM), as well as debit card purchases, checks, money orders, ACH transfers, and wire transfers. Similarly, deposits can be made by depositing cash, checks, or money orders at a branch or an ATM, as well as via mobile check deposit, automated clearing house (ACH) transfer, or wire transfer.

“If you need to use funds for daily transactions, a checking account is the best way to do that,” John Bergquist, President at Lift Financial in South Jordan, Utah, said.

A checking account is useful if you need to:

Pay bills electronically or via check
Make purchases or ATM withdrawals using a linked debit card
Transfer money to an account at a different bank electronically

Checking accounts may or may not be interest-bearing. If it is, the money you deposit earns interest as long as it stays in your account. These accounts can be offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.

What Is a Savings Account?

A savings account is a deposit account that’s designed for holding funds that aren’t earmarked for everyday use. For example, you might open a savings account to grow your emergency fund, set aside money for a vacation, or build your down payment.

Like checking accounts, savings accounts have different rates and are from different financial institutions like traditional banks, online banks, and credit unions.

You're more likely to earn higher interest with savings accounts. Banks pay savers an annual percentage yield (APY) as an incentive for depositing and keeping money in their savings accounts. The APY savers can earn isn’t uniform, however. It can vary from bank to bank. On average the national savings rate was 0.46% as of Aug. 19, 2024.
1

“An online savings account is a much better option at almost 20 times higher a rate than the traditional checking account,” Bergquist says. “In fact, it’s even very similar to what you would earn when purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond.”

Online banks often have the capability to pass on higher interest rates to savers, owing to their lower overhead and operating costs. The rates can vary widely, but it’s not unthinkable to find high-yield online savings accounts from banks and credit unions earning an APY of up to 5.50%.

In addition to higher interest rates on savings, online banks may charge fewer fees. For example, a traditional bank may charge a monthly maintenance or minimum balance fee for a savings account. An online bank may not charge either of these fees.

Withdrawal Limits on Checking and Savings Accounts

An advantage of checking accounts is that withdrawals are virtually unlimited. You could use your card multiple times a day to shop, make daily cash withdrawals, and pay your bills without being penalized. But that may not be the case with your savings account. This started with Regulation D, which was a rule imposed on banks by the Federal Reserve.

According to Regulation D:

Share savings accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts (MMAs) were limited to a maximum of six withdrawals per month. Your account provider could charge excess withdrawal fees if you exceed the maximum number of withdrawals per month.
Transactions that counted toward the limit included ACH withdrawals, overdraft transfers from savings to checking, transfers made via online banking or by phone, debit card point-of-sale (POS) transactions, and transfers or withdrawals made via fax.
Unlimited withdrawals from savings accounts were allowed when made in person, via mailed request, or at an ATM.
2

Although Regulation D withdrawal restrictions were lifted in April 2020, some financial institutions may still charge their customers excess withdrawal fees if they're made from a savings account.
3
 It's always a good idea to ask your bank or credit union for the rules about your savings account so you're not surprised with fees that you weren't expecting.

Shop around to get the best deal—one that fits your needs and lifestyle. For instance, if you're looking for a better return, some banks reward customer loyalty with higher rates if they open both a checking and savings account and link them together.


Checking vs. Savings Accounts: Which Is Better?

When comparing checking and savings accounts, you may find that one is better suited to your needs. In some cases, you may benefit most from using both. Here are some questions to consider when shopping around for a checking or savings account.

What are the fees associated with the account? For example, is there a monthly maintenance fee?
Is there a minimum balance requirement?
Does a savings account come with an ATM card or a debit card?
Are there daily limits on ATM withdrawals for checking accounts?
Are there daily limits on deposits for a checking or savings account?
Does the account earn interest, and, if so, what is the APY?

You should also check whether the bank offers any special perks for opening an account.

“Banks are highly competitive in a ridiculously low-interest-rate environment, and there are occasional incentives that could make a checking or savings account more attractive,” O’Donnell says. For example, you may be able to join a debit card rewards or discount program that could save you money. Or you could take advantage of promotional deals for opening other accounts, such as a money market or certificate of deposit (CD).

Lastly, keep in mind the kind of access you need when it comes to banking. Whether you choose a checking or savings account, consider whether the bank offers the online and mobile banking tools you need to manage your money digitally, the number of ATM locations, and whether branch banking is available, if that’s something you occasionally use.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How Much Money Should You Have in Your Checking Account?

How much you should have in your checking account depends on a few key factors. If your bank requires you to hold a minimum balance in your account, you should at least have that amount or you risk being hit with service charges that eat away at your balance. But it's always a good idea to keep at least one to three months' worth of expenses in your checking account. This ensures you have enough to cover your living expenses and bills in case of an emergency.

What Do You Need to Open a Checking or Savings Account?

There are several things you'll need before you can open a bank account of any kind, whether that's a checking or savings account. That's because the financial institution needs to verify your identity. This means you'll need a valid piece of government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver's license, proof of your address, or your Social Security number.

 If your bank has a deposit requirement, you'll have to bring that with you, too.

Which Savings Account Earns You the Most Interest?

The interest rate on most savings accounts is fairly low. But that doesn't mean all is lost as there are several options available for higher rates—you just have to look. Consider tiered accounts that offer higher rates as you deposit more money. Another option is the high-yield savings account, which pays more when you deposit a higher balance, usually over $5,000. If that's not enough, you may want to open a money market account, which has the features of both a checking and savings account. This type of account uses the money you deposit to invest in other vehicles. But it's still highly liquid.

How Do You Choose a Savings Account?

Savings accounts have several features to consider when choosing one for yourself. First, the interest rate will help you earn money. The higher the interest rate, the more you will earn. Compare the fees and withdrawal restrictions when shopping for a savings account.

The Bottom Line

Both checking accounts and savings accounts can be valuable tools in your financial life. While they both hold your money safely, they are designed for different purposes. With checking accounts, you can use your money to make convenient purchases. With savings accounts, you can earn some interest and keep your funds safe. Before you open a checking or savings account, compare different rates and terms to ensure you get the best account for you.

top high-yield savings accounts 2023,investopedia,"The New Nation-Leading Rate on Money Market Accounts, July 27, 2023","The top nationwide rate on a money market account rose today to 5.21%, up from 5.06% APY. You can also find other options above 5.00% in our daily money market rankings.",https://www.investopedia.com/new-nation-leading-rate-money-market-accounts-7566613,"For the first time in four weeks, we've seen a change in the top rate you can earn on a money market account. The best nationally available money market account rate in the country is now 5.21% APY, which bests the previous leading rate of 5.06% APY. It's also a tad better than the top high-yield savings account rate of 5.20% APY.


Today's New Money Market Leader

Coming to the fore today in our daily ranking of the best money market accounts is Republic Bank of Chicago. Its 5.21% APY rate is available with a minimum deposit and ongoing balance of $2,500. It's available for anyone in the U.S. to open online, with the exception of residents of four states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

If the minimum balance or your state of residence is an obstacle, don't fret, as there are plenty of other options to earn an exceptional rate right now. Our rankings list the top 15 rates in the country, including three other options that pay 5.00% or better.

If you don't care about the option to write paper checks from your account, you should also consider the best high-yield savings accounts. Though the rate leader there is paying 5.20% APY—one basis point below the new money market leader—the list of options paying at least 5.00% is more robust for those accounts, giving you 14 other choices paying 5.00% APY or more.

Money Market and Savings Account Rates Are at Record Highs

Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has been aggressively hiking the federal funds rate rate in a fight against inflation that reached a 40-year high in June 2022.1 Over the last 17 months, the Fed has implemented 11 rate increases, raising rates in every meeting except one. With its latest increase yesterday, the benchmark rate has reached a target range of 5.25-5.50%, its highest level in more than 22 years.2

The central bank's moves have a direct impact on savers, because when the federal funds rate climbs, it pushes banks and credit unions to raise the rates they pay customers on savings, money market, and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. As a result, the rates on these accounts have surged in 2022 and 2023, and they are still climbing.

Money Market vs. High-Yield Savings Account: Which Should You Choose?

In times past, money market accounts required a larger balance and paid a higher interest rate than standard savings account. But the arrival of high-yield savings account on the scene has changed that, with the top-paying savings account in the country often paying a higher rate than the best money market account.

The requirement to deposit a large balance is also largely gone. There are certainly money market accounts, as well as high-yield savings accounts, that require a minimum balance of $10,000 or $25,000. But there are also plenty that stipulate no minimum deposit or a very modest one.

As a result, money market and high-yield savings accounts are fairly interchangeable these days, with one exception: Money market accounts allow you to write paper checks from your account.

If this is useful to you, shop from the best rates on true money market accounts that offer this feature. Just don't assume that if the account has ""money market"" in its name it offers check-writing. Some banks simply use the term on regular savings accounts as a marketing tactic.

If writing paper checks from your savings is not important to you, it's smart to consider both the top high-yield savings accounts and the top money market accounts, and then choose whichever option offers you the best features for your needs.

Will Savings and Money Market Rates Climb Higher?

Yesterday's rate increase by the Federal Reserve was widely expected, prompting many banks and credit unions to raise their deposit rates ahead of the official announcement. That's why we've been seeing increases over the last many weeks.

But it's probably true that some banks deferred a planned rate increase until seeing the Fed hike on the books. Alternatively, some may find themselves having to offer higher rates to compete in light of other institutions raising their savings and money market rates.

Also, the Fed won't meet again on rates until September 19–20, meaning the fed funds rates will stay put for eight weeks.3 During that stretch, it's likely that some banks and credit unions will bump up their savings and money market rates to attract customer deposits in this high-rate environment.

What happens to savings and money market rates further down the road is impossible to predict right now. That's because the Fed's written announcement yesterday, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's post-announcement comments, have made it clear the committee has not decided whether it will or won't implement any more rate hikes in 2023. Powell emphasized that each rate decision will be taken ""meeting by meeting.""4

What we do know is that today's record rates on money market and savings accounts, as well as CDs, will probably inch up a bit more as a result of the Fed's July increase. But whether they keep climbing after that is currently anyone's guess.


For funds you know you won't need for a while, you could lock in one of today's record rates for months or years down the road with a CD. Unlike savings and money market accounts, whose rates can drop at any time, a CD's rate is fixed for the full term you choose. To make your shopping easy, simply visit our daily ranking of the best CD rates.




Rate Collection Methodology Disclosure

Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.

Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

Since October, the leading rate on a nationally available savings account had been holding at 5.40% APY.
A new offer of 5.50% APY was unveiled today by Milli, taking it to the top of our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings account rates.
Milli is an app-based account offered by the FDIC-insured First National Bank of Omaha. Anyone nationwide can apply for a Milli account.
For those who prefer banking via a computer-accessible webpage, the previous leader, Popular Direct, is still offering its high-yield savings account rate of 5.40% APY.
Savings accounts are paying their highest rates in roughly two decades, thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign aimed at taming inflation.

The full article follows below this list of offers from our partners.

The New High-Yield Savings Account Leader

Back in October, high-yield savings account rates climbed to a new record high of 5.40% APY. But since then, the leading savings account rate has marched in place. Until today, that is. You can now earn 5.50% APY on your savings with Milli, an app-based account backed by the brick-and-mortar First National Bank of Omaha.

Anyone in the U.S. can apply for a Milli account, but note that if you're accepted, you can only do your banking via Milli's mobile app. There is no online banking via a website.

For anyone comfortable with app-based banking, Milli offers its record rate with the added perks of no required minimum balance and no monthly maintenance fees. Milli also offers the handy feature of setting up special savings ""jars,"" which allow you to earmark certain funds for specific savings goals.

Like all the institutions in our daily ranking of the best savings account rates, your deposits with Milli are federally insured. Because Milli is run by an FDIC-insured parent bank, your Milli deposits of up to $250,000 are also FDIC-insured.

Prefer to Bank With Your Computer?

Our runner-up, the previous leader, is another good option—particularly if you don't want to rely only on app-based banking. Popular Direct's high-yield savings account pays an almost-as-high rate of 5.40% APY, also with no required minimum balance. You do have to open the account with an initial deposit of at least $100, but you're not required to leave the money there. Popular Direct also does not charge a monthly maintenance fee.

In addition to offering web-based banking, Popular Direct also provides mobile check deposit, something that Milli's app does not. So if you think you'll want to deposit paper checks to your high-yield savings account, Popular Direct is your best-paying option.

Savings and money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means the bank can change your rate at any time without warning. Right now, rates are high, and it looks likely they will remain elevated in the coming months. But at some point in the future, the Federal Reserve will begin reducing the federal funds rate. When it's clear that day is imminent, banks will begin lowering their savings and money market rates.

Many More Options for Earning a Historically High Rate

You have plenty of other stellar options to choose from, too. Our daily ranking of the best savings account rates includes almost 20 additional accounts that pay 5.15% APY or higher. So it's easy to find one that pays many times more than the national rate average of 0.46% APY.
1

You may find that the savings account at the ""big bank"" where you perhaps have your checking account is paying pennies. By moving some of your cash to an outside high-yield account, you can earn much more interest every month.

If you're not used to holding money somewhere other than your primary bank, you might worry that it will be inconvenient. But online banking makes transfers between institutions extremely easy these days. And though the transfer process can take one to three days, you can plan for this by not moving every penny of your savings to the new account. Just keep some portion in reserve where you have your checking account, in case you need immediate access to some of your savings.

Money market accounts are another good option to consider for your cash savings, and we make the research easy with our daily ranking of the best money market account rates. Like high-yield savings accounts, the best-paying money market accounts offer a great rate with easy access to your money. On top of that, money market accounts offer the ability to write checks, unlike savings accounts.

Earn Even More by Putting Some Savings in a CD

Another smart option for your cash savings is to stash some of it in a top-paying certificate of deposit (CD). Though you won't have access to funds put in a CD for months or years, depending on the term you choose, you stand to earn even more with one of the options in our daily ranking of the top nationwide CDs than you could in a savings account. That's because the best CD rates—which currently reach up to 5.88% APY—tend to be higher than the best savings account rates.

CDs are an excellent option when rates are high because they allow you to lock in one of today's record rates and extend it far into the future. Just remember that cashing out your CD before its maturity date will incur an early withdrawal penalty, so it's best to think carefully about how much you can lock away and for how long.

Best CD Rates for September 2024: Up to 5.25%
Will Savings Account Rates Go Higher This Year?

Savings rates closely follow the federal funds rate, the target interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. In an effort to combat decades-high inflation, the Fed has been rapidly raising the federal funds rate since March 2022. The Fed implemented seven bold and rapid rate hikes in 2022, totaling 4.25%, and has more modestly raised the fed funds rate four times in 2023. This has brought the central bank's total increase to 5.25% so far.
2

This aggressive campaign of hikes has pushed banks and credit unions to raise savings, money market, and certificate of deposit rates to record levels. In fact, today's top savings account rate of 5.50% APY is likely the highest we've seen since 2001, as that's the last time the fed funds rate has been this high.
2

But it's appearing increasingly likely that the Fed is finished with its rate hikes and will hold rates steady for some uncertain amount of time. Though it's difficult to predict Fed rate moves several months down the road, it's reasonable to expect that savings rates will likely hold somewhat stable for the time being—but will begin to decline once it appears the Fed is ready to consider a rate cut.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
It generally takes around 10 minutes to open a high-yield savings account online.
High-yield savings accounts may pay an interest rate of 10 to 12 times the national average.

Online-only banks tend to offer the best high-yield savings account rates because they don't carry the overhead expense of running physical branches.

Though the interest rate should be a top consideration, an institution's fees, requirements, and account features are also key factors.
You can likely earn much more by opening a savings account at a different institution than where you do your primary banking.

Investopedia / Jake Shi

1. Shop for the Top Rates

Hundreds of savings accounts at banks and credit unions are accessible via the internet. If you hope to beat inflation, you may need to move funds into a high-yield savings account outside your primary bank. There's no limit to the number of checking and savings accounts you can have at multiple banks.
1

That said, you may already bank at a top-paying institution. So, check what you can earn in a savings account at your existing bank or credit union. Then, review the top national high-yield savings account rates.

Many of the top rates are offered by online banks. Internet-only banks don't carry the overhead costs of physical branches and often pay the most competitive deposit rates in the country. However, many brick-and-mortar institutions now offer separately-branded online banks with competitive rates.
2



When shopping for rates, be sure to read the fine print regarding:

Rate: Is the rate introductory or promotional, and available for a limited time only?
Compounding: How often is earned interest added to your balance?
Minimum requirements: Do you need a minimum account balance to earn the high-yield APY?
Maximum requirements: Can you earn high-yield interest rates only up to a certain account balance?

Keeping your savings at a different institution, where it may take a bit more effort to access, may help you avoid the temptation of withdrawing from your account and reach your savings goals faster.

2. Choose the Institution Best for You

After identifying rates of the top-paying savings accounts, it's time to figure out the right choice for you. If you find your existing bank's savings rate competitive and worthwhile, open a new account with your current bank. You'll enjoy the convenience of a single bank login, instantaneous transfers between checking and savings accounts, and a streamlined signup process.

But if you're like most rate shoppers, you'll find that you can earn more by opening a savings account at a new institution. Top national rates are often 10 to 12 times higher than the national average rate.
3

If a top rate is from a credit union, ensure you qualify. Banking at a credit union requires you to first become a member of that institution. Any credit union appearing on Investopedia's ranking of the top savings accounts accepts members nationwide, although some may require a small membership fee in the form of a charitable donation.


Review any fees that may be associated with the institution's account. Common bank fees include:

Inactivity fees
Account closing fees
Paper statement fees

You may also want to research the institution by reviewing complaints regarding high-yield savings accounts in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Complaint Database. However, there are very few complaints—only 53 out of over 5 million complaints total—as the CFPB has taken action against companies that misrepresented high-yield savings accounts.
4
5

Check to be sure that any institution you bank with is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which federally protects up to $250,000 of your deposits at that institution.
6

3. Complete the Account Application

Once you've selected your new high-yield savings account institution, complete the required application, likely online. In most cases, it should only take 10 minutes or so.

You will need to provide the institution with your:
7

Full name
Address
Telephone number
Email address
Identification number, such as your Social Security number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)
Driver's license, passport, or other government-issued photo ID number


You'll also need to decide whether to open this account as a single individual or jointly with another person, such as your spouse. If you opt for a joint account, provide all of the second applicant's information, as well.

You can visit a branch if you're opening an account at a physical bank in your community. But even with local institutions, you can likely open an account online. This saves you a trip to the branch and makes for a faster process than in-person with a banker.

You must provide your Social Security number because your savings account interest earnings will be taxable income you must pay taxes on.
8

4. Fund Your New Account

Some institutions require you to set up an electronic transfer of funds from an outside account into your new account. You may be asked to do so immediately to fund the minimum initial deposit, while others allow you some time, and others don't have minimum deposit requirements.

Ways to fund a new savings account include:

Transfer from another bank
Send a paper check
Perform a mobile deposit of a check

Funding your new account from an existing bank account usually requires you to provide the institution's routing and account numbers. The online application may also ask for your bank's login credentials to instantly verify the account.

If not, your new account may send two trial deposits to the account you're linking, which you'll use for account verification over the next few days.

5. Enroll in Online Banking and Download the App

Once you've opened your new account, it's typically wise to enroll in online banking. You may be able to do this right away after completing your online application. For some banks and credit unions, you may have to wait a few days until you get an email or letter with the account information for online enrollment.

As you set up online banking, note your username and password in a secure physical place or with password storage software. Then, set up the bank's app on your smartphone or tablet. Bank apps are free for customers. Within the app, you'll need to log in with your username and password to interact with your accounts.

6. Establish Beneficiaries

Unless you already did this during the application process, log in to your account and designate one or more beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are those you name to inherit your account balance should something happen to you.

Almost all accounts allow for establishing a primary beneficiary. Many also accommodate secondary beneficiaries, who inherit the account balance if the primary beneficiary isn't alive.

A typical scenario is to designate your spouse as the primary beneficiary (if they are not jointly named on the account) and your children as secondary beneficiaries. But your beneficiary choices are up to you and your situation.

7. Turn On Alerts and E-Statements

Review your choices for account alert options. You might want to get alerts regarding deposits or withdrawals over a certain amount or if your account balance drops below a designated amount. You can often choose whether activity alerts are sent by email, text, or notifications from the app.

Also, consider whether you want electronic account statements. E-statements may offer more secure protection against identity theft, and some online-only banks may require opting into e-statements—or charge a monthly fee if you request paper statements.

8. Link Additional Transfer Accounts

If you set up a transfer for the initial deposit, you likely linked an external bank account to your new high-yield savings account. But with most accounts, you can link multiple external bank accounts. This can be useful if you bank at multiple institutions or often transfer funds to your children's accounts.

Start the account linking process immediately so it's ready when you need it; the setup can take a few days.

9. Follow Your Account's Rules

Lastly, understand all of your account's rules and requirements to avoid future fees. Fees could quickly eat into any interest returns.

While some accounts have no monthly fees, others do have such fees. But there are usually specific actions you can take to avoid them. These actions could include:

Carrying a certain minimum balance in the account

Setting up a direct deposit for a minimum amount monthly
Establishing a recurring transfer
Having a linked account at the same institution

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What Is a High-Yield Savings Account?

A high-yield savings account pays a much higher interest rate than other savings accounts. One reason these rates are typically higher is because they're offered by online-only banks, which have much lower overhead costs. Brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions sometimes offer high-yield accounts, but they are more common at online institutions.

How Does a High-Yield Savings Account Work?

A high-yield savings account pays you interest on the money deposited in that account. However, institutions that offer the highest rewards may not provide other standard banking features and services, so you may need to have your checking account at a different location. Most high-yield savings accounts don’t offer ATM cards, so incoming and outgoing money transfers happen via electronic transfer or mobile check deposit.

Who Should Open a High-Yield Savings Account?

You should consider opening a high-yield savings account if you like the account rates and terms, and you accept the bank's guidelines and limitations. A high-yield savings account could be a good fit for someone who doesn’t mind the inconvenience of having multiple accounts at different banking institutions.

High-yield savings accounts can be ideal for those who want to leave some extra money in the bank and don't need immediate access. They can be used for an emergency fund or to save up for a large purchase.

Is a High-Yield Savings Account Worth the Cost?

There usually aren’t many costs associated with high-yield savings accounts as long as you meet the minimum balance requirements and follow the account guidelines. High-yield savings accounts offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. They’re still insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000.
1

Bottom Line

High-yield savings accounts can be great for accumulating money for future purchases or emergencies, and they're usually quick and easy to open. Some of these financial institutions might also offer high-yield checking accounts. Typically, you'll find that your primary banking institution doesn't offer the best rates, so opening a new account at a different institution can be smart. Online-only banks tend to offer the best rates, although this isn't always true. You'll earn much more than a typical savings account, but keep an eye on fees that might eat up that interest."

If you’re a fan of uncomplicated banking, Barclays could suit you. You don’t have to worry about account minimums. There’s no minimum deposit requirement you must meet, and no limit to the number of withdrawals you can make per month. Likewise, you don’t need to maintain a minimum balance to keep your savings account open, and for the Online Savings account you don't have to satisfy any minimum balance requirements to qualify for a higher APY tier. (Note: If you have a balance of less than $1 for 180 days or more, Barclays does reserve the right to close your account.)

As far as other bank fees are concerned, Barclays’ fees are notably lower than what other financial institutions might charge. For example, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the average non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee was $34 in 2022.
6
 Barclays, by comparison, charges just $5 for NSF fees. 

Here are some of the fees you might incur using your Barclays Savings account.

Stop Payment Fee: $0
Cashier’s Check Fee: $5
Returned Deposit Fee: $5 (per item)
Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) Fee: $5 (per item)
Paper Statements: $0.50 per statement

Barclays savings accounts and CDs also come with insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

 So, you can rest easy knowing that your deposits are safe in the unlikely event of a bank failure. 

The FDIC insures deposits for up to $250,000 (per depositor, per ownership category, per FDIC-insured bank).

Pros and Cons of Barclays Savings Accounts
Pros

Low fees

No minimum balance requirement

No withdrawal limits

Cons

No U.S. branches

No checking accounts

Limited withdrawal options

Pros Explained
Low fees: Barclays doesn’t charge monthly maintenance fees, and its other fees are relatively low compared to many competitors. 
No minimum balance requirement: Some banks require that you maintain a certain minimum balance to earn interest, but Barclays does not.  
No withdrawal limits: Certain savings accounts have monthly withdrawal limits, but there are no monthly withdrawal limits with the Barclays Online Savings Account.
Cons Explained
No U.S. branches: Barclays has ample physical branches in the United Kingdom, but it doesn’t have any brick-and-mortar locations in the United States.
No checking accounts: While the Barclays Online Savings Account has some perks, this bank doesn’t offer a checking account you can use for everyday spending. 
Limited withdrawal options: You’ll need to complete a transfer to an external bank account or request a paper check if you want to withdraw money from your Barclays savings account. There’s no ATM access with this account.
About Barclays: Other Savings Options

Barclays is a British international bank with headquarters based in London, England—where it traces its roots back over 300 years. The U.S. subsidiary of Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank, is located in Wilmington, Delaware. 

Barclays is perhaps best known for its variety of co-branded credit cards. Well-qualified applicants can open Barclays credit cards that feature rewards, cash back, and sometimes balance transfer opportunities. 

The online bank has limited options where savings are concerned. Aside from the savings accounts above, the only other type of savings-related deposit accounts the bank offers are certificates of deposit, but they sometimes have very competitive APYs; see Barclays CD rates to learn more.

Alternatives to Barclays Savings Accounts
Other high-yield savings accounts: Barclays' savings accounts offer competitive rates, but you may find that another high-yield savings account suits your needs better. Fortunately, many banking institutions offer high-yield savings accounts, often with rates above 4%.
Money market account: Money market accounts (MMAs) may come with rates similar to high-yield savings accounts, but they also have features you’d get with a checking account. Many MMAs come with checks and ATM cards, making it easy to withdraw your money when needed. (Read the fine print before opening a money market account. While these accounts have some features similar to checking accounts, they often come with monthly withdrawal limits.)
Certificates of deposit: Certificates of deposit (CDs) come with relatively high rates and set terms that may range from a month to 10 years. If you can afford to keep your money invested for a set period, a CD could be a smart option. While the best certificates of deposit (CDs) come with generous rates, you’ll typically pay a penalty if you withdraw your money before your CD matures. This penalty is often equal to a few months’ worth of interest. 
Series I savings bonds: Series I saving bond rates are partially tied to inflation rates, so when inflation is high, so too are I bond rates. These bonds are backed by the U.S. Treasury and can continue to earn interest for 30 years. You can also cash them in sooner if you’d prefer, but if you do so earlier than five years, you’ll pay a penalty.
9
Brokerage account: Purchasing stocks and other assets through a brokerage account could result in higher earnings than you’d get with the Barclays Online Savings Account. That said, you can also lose money when you invest, so keep that in mind before opening a brokerage account.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is Barclays Good for Savings?

Barclays Bank could be a solid choice for savers who are comfortable with online banking and don’t need direct ATM access to their funds. The bank’s Online Savings account offers a simple, uncomplicated way to earn above-average interest rates without having to worry about minimum balances, APY tiers, or monthly maintenance fees. And the Tiered Savings account may offer a higher rate than that for a higher balance. However, if your primary goal is to earn the highest interest rate possible on your savings, you might want to consider other savings account options as well; check out the best high-yield savings accounts to see what you could get.

How Often Does Barclays Pay Interest?

You earn interest on your Barclays savings account in the same basic way that interest works on savings accounts from other financial institutions. Interest begins to accrue on the same business day you deposit cash into your savings account. From there, the interest will compound daily. The bank credits any interest you earn to your account once a month.
5

Is Barclays’ Savings Account FDIC-Insured?

Barclays Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Therefore, any cash you deposit in a Barclays savings account, certificate of deposit, or other type of deposit account will receive the backing of FDIC insurance.
7
 

Not all bank accounts are insured by the FDIC. When you choose a financial institution, it’s important to choose a bank that’s a member of the FDIC or a credit union that’s a member of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to protect your savings. 

Is Barclays Bank Based in the U.S.?

Barclays’ online banking business along with its credit card and payment group is based in Wilmington, Delaware. The Barclays Wealth unit is headquartered in New York, New York. However, the parent company of Barclays Bank, now called Barclays UK, traces its roots back to 1690 in London, England.

Snowball method debt payoff effectiveness studies,investopedia,Top 6 Marriage-Killing Money Issues,Strengthen your marriage by understanding and dealing with these six major financial stressors.,https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/marriage-killing-money-issues.asp,"According to Fidelity's 2024 Couples and Money study, 45% of partners argue about money at least occasionally and 25% of couples identify money as their greatest relationship challenge.1 Here are six common financial issues that stress married couples.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
One-quarter of all couples say money is their greatest relationship issue.
Couples can employ various tools and strategies to pay off debt.
Couples should communicate their expectations and ideas about how to raise and pay for children.
A financial advisor or planner can provide couples with unbiased advice.

1. Separating Earnings

Sometimes couples split the bills down the middle or allocate them in some other manner that seems fair and equitable. Once the bills have been covered, each spouse can spend what's left as they see fit. This may cause resentment over the individual purchases made. It also divides spending power, eliminating much of the financial value of marriage.

This method may not address long-term goals like buying a home or securing retirement. One spouse may even hide money from the other, known as financial infidelity.

2. Carrying Old Debts

Many people come into a marriage with student debt, credit card debt, a gambling habit, or something else. Sparks can fly between partners while discussing income, spending, and debt servicing.

Most debts brought into a marriage stay with the person who incurred them and are not extended to a spouse. Your partner's debt won't likely hurt your credit rating. In states that operate under common law, debts incurred jointly after marriage are owed by both spouses.

In nine states all property and debts are shared after marriage regardless of individual or joint account status. They are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. In these community-property states, any debt incurred after the wedding is automatically shared—even when applied for individually.2

3. Personality Differences

Even if both partners are debt-free, the age-old conflict between spenders and savers can play out in multiple ways. It is important to know your money personality—as well as that of your partner—and to discuss these differences openly.

Many may display characteristics of either over time but usually revert to one main type. Whichever profile you and your spouse most closely fit, it's best to recognize bad habits, address them, and moderate them for the relationship.

4. Power Plays

Power plays may occur in one of four scenarios if one partner has a paid job and the other doesn't, one spouse earns considerably more than the other, or one partner comes from a wealthy family money and the other doesn't.

When one or more of these situations are present, the one who makes or has the most money may want to dictate the couple's spending priorities.

5. Supporting a Growing Family

Whether and when to have children is a financial decision. Food, clothing, shelter, Little League, ballet, prom gowns, minivans, and college tuition are on the list of child-related expenses.

Having kids isn't just about the cost. If one partner cuts their hours, works from home, or leaves a career to raise children, couples should address how that changes marriage dynamics, assumptions about retirement, lifestyle, and more.

$374,634

In 2023, the average cost of raising a child to age 18 in a middle-income household.3

6. Coping With Extended Family

Sometimes partners help with the costs of their family of origin. His parents need a new car. Her brother can't make the rent. One spouse is writing a check and the other wants to know why that money wasn't used to address needs at home or fund a vacation for ""us.""

When a serious crisis arises, such as illness, major storm damage, or an unexpected death, the pressure to help is often magnified.

Couples can enlist the help of a financial advisor or planner for expert, impartial advice.

How To Handle Money Issues

According to Fidelity, effective communication is key to financial success for couples. Those who communicate well are more likely to discuss their finances and anticipate living comfortably in retirement.4

Communicate: Talk openly about your preferences for handling money, your goals for the future, and any concerns you have about how you jointly handle your income. Attitudes about money filter through many aspects of daily life.
Set Financial Goals: A couple should agree on their long-term goals and how to get there. Much of that discussion will involve financial matters. Whether your priorities include having children, buying a house, saving towards a comfortable retirement, or all of the above, they should be planned for and agreed upon.
Deal With Debt: For many couples dealing with debt, partners should have an honest, nonjudgmental discussion about the debts they would bring into a marriage. Couples can apply debt payoff strategies, such as paying off the higher-interest debt first (the debt avalanche method) or paying off the smallest loans first (the debt snowball method).
Sign a Prenup or Postnup: For couples unsure about joint financial matters before marriage, they may choose a prenuptial agreement. If you've already said ""I do,"" and want more than vows to protect yourself, you may want to create a pain-free postnuptial agreement, also called a marital contract.
Know Thyself: Personality will play a major role in your financial plans. Talking about your views and feelings can help put both partners at ease, or at least let them know what to expect. If you've got more cash, you need to be sensitive about how you present spending decisions. If you don't have the money, be prepared for stress and tension that is almost inevitable, even in good marriages. Studies have shown that people with more power are more likely to act selfishly, impulsively, and aggressively, and approach others with less empathy.56
Address Family Matters: Extended family can be a huge challenge, and no advice addresses every situation. When choosing to help a family member or accept financial help from a family member, it helps to have a policy agreed upon in advance.
How Can Couples Pass Good Money Habits to Their Children?

Couples can start teaching children about money when they are young. Preparing them for a financially responsible future reduces the odds that they will dip into your wallet as adults and knock your savings plan off track. Use allowances and goals to teach children about earning, saving, and spending money.

Should a Couple Have Individual or Joint Accounts?

Some experts argue that couples should have joint checking accounts and credit card accounts. As personal finance expert, Rachel Cruze points out, the household income and expenses are no longer ""his"" or ""hers,"" they're ""ours."" Joint accounts lend themselves to open, transparent spending habits. Separate accounts can lead to secretive and selfish behavior.7

What Is Financial Infidelity?

Acts of financial infidelity may include opening a separate bank account that a partner is unaware of. It may be hiding debts or an expensive bad habit. It may be squirreling away a secret stash of cash.

The Bottom Line

Good communication before and after tying the knot can dull the blow of bad financial news and lead to honest exchanges about each partner's money anxieties, habits, and expectations. Financial anxieties can become far bigger problems with much more difficult solutions. Couples may find it helpful to schedule a time once a month, once a quarter, or once a year to check in on short- and long-term goals. An annual financial plan and regular check-ins can defuse the tension of talking about money and keep you both on track."
Snowball method debt payoff effectiveness studies,investopedia,How To Make the Most of Your First Paycheck,"To make your first paycheck work best for you, you'll need to learn how to calculate your net pay, budget for expenses and nice-to-haves, and save money for the future.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-paycheck-8642764,"Your first job after high school or college comes with a critical rite of passage into adulthood–earning a regular paycheck. Sometimes, that first paycheck can be a bit of a letdown. You may be surprised that your net earnings are considerably lower than the gross amount. Plus, not all paychecks are created equal depending on your job. You may even panic a little about how you will cover all your expenses. 

The good news? It is possible to get what you need out of your paycheck. Budgeting, financial planning, prioritizing savings, and paying down debt are all ways to help you manage your money, one paycheck at a time. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Understanding the amount of your first paycheck, including payroll deductions and taxes, is crucial for effective financial management.
Creating a budget is essential for managing your paycheck and ensures you can get the most out of it.
Prioritizing saving and investing a portion of your paycheck can lead to long-term financial security and growth.
Managing debt is important for stability and reducing financial stress.
Seeking financial education resources can help raise your financial literacy IQ and, in turn, help you make smart money decisions. 
Understand Your Income

At one time, when an employee received a paycheck, they were handed a literal paper check with all the withholdings listed on it. While employers still provide paycheck notices, most issue paychecks via direct deposit directly into employees' bank accounts.1 If you're not in the habit of looking at your digital pay stub, it can be easy to overlook how taxes and deductions affect your pay. 

Sometimes withholdings can even be surprising, says Joni Alt, a certified financial planner and senior wealth advisor at Evermay Wealth Management. 

""I remember after my daughter graduated from college, she and her friends had started their jobs, and they were at our house, and the conversation was, 'What is FICA, and why did they take my money?'"" shares Alt. ""I chuckled because they were becoming adults in real life.""

Alt suggests that young people should educate themselves about FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), the paycheck contributions that fund Social Security and Medicare. Employees and employers split FICA contributions, paying 6.2% each toward Social Security and 1.45% each toward Medicare in each paycheck.2

To estimate your net pay, you must calculate your FICA contributions, plus other withholdings like state and federal taxes, shared costs for employer-sponsored health insurance, and contributions to retirement funds like a 401(k) or 403(b). This will enable you to create a budget.

How To Calculate Your Net Pay

How much money is withheld depends on your salary, where you live, and how many dependents you have. 

Typical withholdings include:3

Federal and state taxes: Your total will depend on where you live and how much you make.
FICA (Social Security and Medicare): 6.2% of your salary for Social Security; 1.45% for Medicare
Health insurance: Most employers ask you to contribute something towards your health insurance. For example, according to 2023 information from KFF, employees with health care coverage contributed 17% of the total costs on average.4  
Retirement benefit contributions: Your amount will depend on how much you choose to contribute. Experts advise giving some amount each paycheck. 
Net Pay Example

Let's say you earn $61,600 a year, the median earnings for a 25- to 34-year-old with a bachelor's degree, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.5 At this salary, your gross pay would be $61,600. Divide that by 12 and you have your monthly gross pay of $5,133.33. 

To figure out your net pay, determine how much you contribute to FICA, federal and state taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions. Then, subtract those contributions from your gross pay.  

Here's an example of how to determine monthly net pay, assuming a 12% effective federal income tax rate and 4% state tax: 

Federal and state taxes (16%): $821.33
FICA (7.65%): $392.70
Health insurance: $100 
Retirement contributions (10%): $513.33

After these expenses, your monthly take-home pay would be $3,305.97. If you get paid semi-monthly or weekly, divide your yearly pay by the number of paychecks you receive per year, determine your payroll deductions, and subtract those deductions from your gross pay. 

Try online paycheck estimator tools like the ones at ADP and Charles Schwab to get a quick estimate of your net pay. 

Create a Budget

Creating a budget is the best way to track your income, expenses, savings, and discretionary spending. It can help you decide where you need to save or splurge. According to a survey by Empower, 53% of Americans across generations found learning how to make a budget to be their most valuable financial lesson. (The next most popular lesson: creating an emergency fund.)6 

Having a budget is especially useful when cost-of-living expenses, like groceries and rent, are high. Today, many Americans report feeling pinched due to inflated prices at the supermarket and the gas pump. Plus, over half of U.S. renters are paying over 30% of their income on housing, including utilities, as reported by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.7

A Few Elements To Include in Your Budget:
Net income: This is the money you have coming in each month after withholdings and deductions. 
Expenses: Rent or mortgage, utilities, car payments or other transportation costs, student loans, credit card payments, groceries, and pet food (if you own an animal companion), plus anything else that you have to pay for (versus want to pay for, which goes under another category). 
Savings: Any account designed to save, such as an emergency fund (up to six months of expenses, in case you lose your job) or contributions to a retirement fund.8
Discretionary spending: This is the fun money that goes to nonessential items like dining out, entertainment, gym memberships, and anything else you want to spend on. 
Popular Budget Types 

There are several ways to create a budget, including using pen and paper or one of the many budgeting apps. Popular budgeting plans include:

50/30/20: This is a plan that divides your paycheck into needs, wants, and savings. Fifty percent goes to needs (rent, utilities, or car), 30% to wants (eating out, saving for a trip), and 20% goes into paying off debts beyond minimum payments and putting money into savings. 
The envelope method: This form of budgeting uses envelopes for each expense, such as rent, groceries, entertainment, student loans, etc. You allocate a specific amount for the month in each envelope, and once the money is gone, it's gone. 
Pay yourself first: This is more of a savings strategy. You automatically contribute to a savings or investment account directly from your paycheck. Anything left over is to be used for your expenses or discretionary spending. 

""When my son was in high school and would ask for money, I would ask him if this was a want or a need,"" shared Alt. ""The answer often depended upon the current environment and time. People can control how much they spend and/or save. It's a choice. The 50/30/20 rule is a good guide and starting point. But everyone has a unique situation, so slight modifications may be needed."" 

The most important thing when creating a budget is to consider your individual situation, according to certified financial planner Melissa Joy. 

""I don't subscribe to any one particular rule about budgeting because they all have benefits, and what works for your budget may not work for your roommate, for example, if you have student loans and they don't,"" says Joy, who also hosts the Women's Money Wisdom podcast.  

Ultimately, Joy advises making sure to ""pay yourself first to meet your needs and understand that there isn't a one-size-fits-all-all budget. It depends on your own situation."" 

Prioritize Saving and Investing

It can feel difficult to part with your paycheck for a future you can barely imagine, but the earlier you start investing in your retirement, the better. Contributing your retirement early adds up, thanks to compound interest, which allows you to earn interest on your principal and then interest on that interest, growing over time.9 In addition, any amount contributed to a 401(k) or 403(b) is subtracted from your gross pay, which lowers your taxable income.  

Find out if your employer offers a retirement plan; if so, allocate a percentage of your pay to that account. Some employers will offer to match (up to a certain percentage) their employees' contributions. Taking an employer match is one of the easiest ways to start investing in your retirement, and it is essentially free money. 

Other accounts you can consider funding, even a small amount if you can afford it, are:

Emergency fund
Health Savings Account (HSA)
High-yield savings account
Roth or traditional IRA
Stocks or mutual funds
Where To Start Saving

""I would recommend starting an emergency savings account, over investing in stocks and mutual funds, or opening a Roth or IRA when you are first starting out,"" says Joy. 

After you create an emergency fund, Joy suggests contributing to another account, such as an HSA, which can be used as emergency reserves for medical expenses. Note that you are only eligible to contribute to an HSA if you have a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).10

Joy also encourages young people to take advantage of high-yield savings accounts. ""At this time, these types of high-yield savings accounts can pay off, and there are plenty online to consider that offer high interest rates,"" she shares. 

Alt agrees about using a budget as a beginning point and starting an emergency fund first; when you get that going, ""put money into saving in your company retirement plan to maximize employer matching contributions."" 

She encourages young people to pay down debts such as student loans, credit cards, and other personal loans. ""If there are still extra funds left in your monthly budget, consider contributing to your Health Savings Account (HSA) if available and finally to taxable investments.""

If your current budget doesn't stretch to allow for extra saving at first, practice patience patient. By sticking to a budget, you'll pay down your debts and create room to set aside more funds to save and invest, which will pay off in time.

Manage Debt

Unfortunately, most graduates leave school with some debt, either student loans, credit card debt, or both. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the amount of student loan debt in the United States was $1.6 trillion, approximately $37,087.96 per borrower.11  The College Board estimates that half of the students (2021-2022) from public and private institutions who graduated with a bachelor's degree have student loan debt; the average debt amount was $29,400 per loan holder.12 

According to a 2023 study by Experian, the average credit card debt among Generation Z (18 to 26 years) is $3,262.13 It's not surprising that experts say paying down debts is an important part of budgeting your paycheck. 

Figuring out the best way to pay down your loans for your individual circumstances is key. 

""I recommend doing a personal finance audit every month or so of how you are spending, and then see where you can cut back and put more money towards debts or investments,"" suggests Joy. 

How To Reduce Debt 

When you need to tackle debt, there are options, such as the snowball method, where you pay off your smallest debts first, or the debt avalanche strategy, where you pay the minimum amount due on all debts and then use any extra money left to pay the card or loan with the highest interest. You could also choose to use a debt payoff app. 

""Make sure you make your student loan payments on time, and investigate if you qualify for student loan repayment plans or student loan forgiveness programs,"" says Joy. In terms of credit card debt? ""Get rid of it, especially the cards with high interest rates,"" she recommends. 

If you don't have a credit card, be careful about taking them out, especially if you are on a tight budget. ""I would not recommend getting a card unless you can afford to pay it off each month,"" cautions Joy. ""And if you have debt that you can't manage, consider credit counseling with a reputable advisor."" 

Seek Financial Education and Resources

Learning more about personal finance is a good way to prepare yourself ahead of time for managing your money in those first paychecks at a new job. Many books for a younger audience, personal finance podcasts, apps, and even banking or investment websites are available.

""I like the podcast Money Wisdom,"" shares Joy. ""‘[And] You Need a Budget' is a good budgeting app if you like to track everything because it offers feedback on your finances,"" she recommends. ""Also, check to see if your workplace offers meetings with financial advisors connected to the retirement plan you are enrolled in."" 

Alt asked her younger colleagues to get a sense of what they like in a budget app. ""I decided to take a census of the 'young people' in my office about budget apps. Simplifi by Quicken was at the top of the list, followed by Excel spreadsheets. Rocket Money had an honorable mention because it helps identify all the subscription services being utilized and where there might be overlap,"" shares Alt. 

She advises young people learning to manage their paycheck to be cautious of the financial education provider, especially if they are trying to sell a product or service. ""Those are not the people you necessarily want to speak to because it might not be in your best interest,"" she explains. 

Joy advises that people should ""take everything from financial influencers on social media with a grain of salt. It's always best to speak to professionals for advice.""  

If your family has a financial advisor or planner, ask your parents about meeting with them. They will likely be a trusted source for advice, and you may be able to pay by the hour for guidance. 

""If that's not available, do research online and look for a fiduciary (an advisor that must put their client's interest ahead of their own). The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is a terrific way to research and look for an advisor that is a fiduciary,"" suggests Alt. 

Tips to Make Sure Your Paycheck Pays the Bills
If you are following a 50/30/20 budget plan, make paying down your debt a ""need"" and put more money into getting rid of debt. 
Try the envelope method of budgeting. Put cash in envelopes (real or virtual) based on your monthly income, and then earmark each envelope for expenses (based on your budget), from groceries to entertainment. Set a cash amount aside for each category. Once the cash is gone, you will have to go without. 
Set up automatic payments to your credit cards and student loans, utilities, and other recurring charges. 
If there is money leftover after your bills are paid, consider setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. Even $25 a paycheck will add up over time. 
Joy recommends doing a financial audit on a regular basis. You may be able to cut corners by simply cutting down on subscriptions, which can add up. ""Look back on a few months and see where your money is going, then audit what you can cut back on,"" she suggests. 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
What Is the 50-30-20 rule?

The 50-30-20 rule is a form of budgeting in which you divide your net income into three areas: 50% goes to expenses (needs) like shelter, transportation, and groceries; 30% goes to wants, like entertainment or other non-essentials, and 20% on savings, like a high-yield savings account or an investment account. 

What Is the ""Pay Yourself First"" Strategy?

Pay yourself first is a personal finance strategy recommended by many financial planners and advisers. This means setting up automatic payments from your paycheck to be delivered straight to a retirement or savings account before you get a chance to pay monthly expenses or engage in any discretionary spending. 

How Much Interest Does a Savings Account Earn vs. a Checking Account?

Likely, your direct deposit is linked to a checking account that offers no interest or much less interest than a savings account, especially a high-yield savings account. Interest on savings accounts varies from financial institution to financial institution. As of May 2024, the best option for earning interest on a savings account is 5.55% at My Banking Direct, a service of Flagstar Bank, N.A.14 By comparison, a Sapphire Chase Checking account only offers 0.01% interest.15 

How Much Should I Contribute to a 401(K) Plan?

You should always try to take advantage of any matching program your employer offers by contributing at least the percent that they will match. Most financial experts recommend contributing anything versus nothing, but if you can contribute up to 10% or 15% of your annual salary to a retirement account, it will likely pay off over time.16 If you cannot afford that amount, try to add 1% incrementally to your contributions each year. 

What Is a Budgeting App and Which One Should I Use?

Budgeting apps take the guesswork out of a paper-and-pen budget by allocating funds to different categories as set by the user. There are many budgeting apps on the market—some are free, others have fees. The one you use should align with your personal budgeting style and easily integrate with your financial accounts and your phone. 

The Bottom Line

When you get your first full-time job, it may feel challenging to see your net pay and understand how to make it work for you. However, there are several strategies that you can use to help, including setting a realistic budget, contributing to an emergency fund, participating in your employer's retirement plan, and taking advice from the right financial experts. A little planning today will set you up for a positive financial future."
Avalanche method debt repayment savings analysis,investopedia,How Much Does Debt Relief Cost?,"Some debt relief methods come with costs of their own, which can be quite steep. Learn which options are best for you and the debt relief costs you may have to pay.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-a-debt-relief-program-cost-7371803,"Debt relief costs vary widely depending on the method—debt payoff apps are often free or inexpensive, while debt settlement and bankruptcy can cost thousands of dollars in fees.

Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt. We’ll go over the costs for five popular debt relief options: debt settlement, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt payoff apps, and bankruptcy.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Debt settlement companies: Often 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Many services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and—for balance transfer credit cards—balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, although there is much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1

The term “debt relief” often refers to debt settlement companies, but it’s also used as an umbrella term to describe just about anything meant to help ease the financial strain from debt. Many types of loans have specific debt relief options, such as recasting a mortgage or the different income-driven payment plans available for federal student loans. When it comes to anything other than simple unsecured debt (like personal loans and credit cards), it’s best to research the specific debt and contact your lender for assistance. 

Costs of Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?2

Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.

Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.

Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:

Settlement fees: These fees range from 14% to 30% of your debt, but they’re only paid on debts that the company successfully negotiates. Some debt settlement companies base this fee on the amount of settled debt, while others base it on the amount of enrolled debt (again, only concerning accounts that are settled; if the company can’t negotiate one of your debts, you wouldn’t pay fees for that debt).
Monthly account fees: You may be charged a setup and/or monthly fee for the third-party savings account that debt settlement companies require you to use to build up your lump sum payment.

More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:

Income taxes: You’ll generally be required to pay taxes on the amount of debt your creditors forgive when you file your taxes at the end of the year.3 Depending on your tax bracket, that could amount to 10% to 37% (in 2024) of the amount that your creditors forgave.4
Credit damage: Creditors will report late payments, defaults, collections, and debt settlements on your credit reports, which can cause serious damage to your credit. A closed, delinquent account will generally stay on your credit reports for seven years.5
Late payment fees: Creditors will charge late payment fees, which can cause the amount you owe to increase while you’re not making payments on your debt. These fees add to your balance and can be included in settlements, but if the debt settlement company isn’t successful, you’ll owe all those extra fees, too.
Unsuccessful debt settlement: Although old, one 2007 Federal Trade Commission analysis found that only about half of people successfully completed a debt relief and settlement program.6 People who don’t complete the program can end up with worse credit and in more debt than they started with.

If you’re considering debt settlement, it’s important to work with a trustworthy company that doesn’t charge extra-high fees. See the best debt relief companies to explore our top picks.

Costs of Credit Counseling

Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.

Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.7

Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.8 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:

Debt management plan setup fee: $0 to $99
Debt management plan monthly fee: $0 to $75

You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.

Costs of Debt Consolidation/Refinance

Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.

Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.

If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.

Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:

Loan interest: Loans charge interest from the start, albeit at a lower overall rate on average than credit cards (unless you get a 0% APR credit card).9
Origination fees: Loans often come with origination fees ranging from 1% to 6% or more, especially if you don’t have good or excellent credit.

And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:

Annual fees: Balance transfer cards may come with annual fees, which are sometimes waived in the first year. The best cards don’t charge such a fee, however.
Balance transfer fees: Most balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically ranging from 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
Credit card interest: A 0% APR balance transfer card will start charging interest at the end of the 0% intro period, giving you a good incentive to pay down as much as you can during the interim. It’s also possible to lose your 0% rate if you miss a payment. And, if you make any purchases with the card, that spending will accrue interest at the purchase APR (which may or may not be 0%).

The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 

If you don’t qualify for a 0% APR balance transfer, you may still be able to transfer a balance to a credit card—but it probably won’t be a cost-saving move, because normal credit card rates tend to be relatively high.9

Costs of Debt Payoff Apps

Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.

Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.

Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.

App	How It Works	Cost
Undebt.it	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $12/year for premium subscription
Debt Payoff Planner	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $2/month for premium subscription

Bright Money	Create an automated financial plan, including round-ups to pay down debt faster	$10/month–$89/year
Debt Payoff Assistant	Very basic debt snowball planning tool	Free
Costs of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.10

After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:

Court costs: You’ll typically need to pay over $300 to file various documents with your local bankruptcy court (fee waivers or installment payments are sometimes accepted).
Attorney fees: Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,000—or more—to hire an attorney.
Credit counseling/debtor education course fees: Those who file bankruptcy must enroll in credit counseling and debtor education courses. The price for each course is capped at $50, although you’ll often pay less than half of that.1

Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.11 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:

Credit damage: Bankruptcy stays on your credit reports for up to 10 years.12 During that period, it may be difficult for you to get approved for credit, utilities, and even rental housing. The severity of the negative effects decreases over time, however.
Social stigma: People who file for bankruptcy may be treated poorly by others, even if the debt wasn’t their fault in the first place.

Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.

If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”

Don’t forget to look up free legal aid clinics and support available in your area, especially if you’re on a limited income or from an underserved community.

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 

“There are debt relief options for just about anyone who owes money,” said Tayne. “Generally, though, once you know there’s an issue with keeping up on payments, that’s the best time to look for a debt relief option.”

It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.

Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:

Starting (or refining) a budget
Asking for help from family and friends
Cutting expenses and increasing income

The average household was $23,317 in the red, excluding mortgage debt, in the second quarter of 2023.13 That kind of debt can add unhealthy stress to your life, making it harder to make ends meet and get ahead in life.

The Bottom Line

You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 

Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. 

Do Debt Relief Companies Charge a Fee?

Generally, yes; most types of debt relief companies charge some type of fee, although some options are free. Here’s a quick rundown of the costs you can expect, according to Investopedia research:

Debt settlement companies: Typically 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Certain services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and for balance transfer cards, balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, with much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1
How Does Debt Relief Affect Your Credit?

Different debt relief methods have different effects on your credit. Debt payoff apps, credit counseling, and debt management plans don’t have any direct impact on your credit score.14 At the other end of the extreme, bankruptcy and debt settlement have the potential to cause severe damage to your credit that can take years to overcome.

How Long Does Debt Relief Last?

Depending on the type of debt relief program you choose, it could be very quick or take a long time. If you’re just looking for help in making your payments, consolidating your high-interest debt into one personal loan can sometimes be completed in a day. On the other hand, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan can take up to five years to complete.12

Is Debt Relief Worth It?

“In general, if you take the time to research your options and choose a reputable organization or professional, the initial costs will be transparent from the get-go and well worth the savings and relief you get as a result,” said Tayne. To ensure you’re happy with your decision, it’s important to compare all your options and research the full range of costs, including indirect ones such as taxes owed on settled debt. 

How Much Debt Is Too Much?

If you’re having trouble making your monthly payments, you have too much debt. A more specific number to keep in mind, especially for would-be homebuyers, is a debt-to-income ratio of 43%; above this mark, most lenders won’t approve you for a conventional mortgage.15 Some debt-averse people are more concerned about the total amount of their debt. By paying down their debt faster they may be able to sleep better at night, even if their monthly payments are currently manageable. "

Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money.

However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense. 

Whether you're hoping to go full FIRE (financial independence, retire early) or just want to feel more on top of your expenses and planning, this guide will offer practical steps to get you where you want to go. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
There are a variety of definitions for financial independence, and it’s important to find which feels right for you.
Financial independence is the key to achieving long-term financial security and freedom.
Assessing your current financial situation is crucial for identifying areas of improvement and potential savings.
Creating a budget and a savings plan fosters independence.
Investing wisely can accelerate your path toward financial freedom.
What Is Financial Independence?

“Financial independence means different things to different people,” says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. “Some see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.” 

Russell continues, “For some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.”

No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences.

Financial Self-Sufficiency

At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. 

For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less—even with three kids in tow. 

“[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,"" says Brock Waterman. 

After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. 

Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. 

While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer.

Freedom From Employment

Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans.

“Investing 10-15% of gross income for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,” says Anna N’Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence.  

While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings.

Autonomy Over Amounts

Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too.

“Many financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,” she says.

Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. “When we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,” he says. 

After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care.  

Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal.

Building Long-Term Security

Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don’t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don’t.

For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. 

“They'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,” Waterman explains. 

Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. 

“Focus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,” he advises. “High-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent financial management and investment strategies.” 

Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul.

Why Women Can Benefit Greatly From Financial Independence

While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities.

According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350.

REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's survey data shows a gender wage gap within marriages, too: 60% percent of women respondents with a male partner said that they earned less than their significant other. 


While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. 

Women Live Longer 

The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,  life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women in the United States and 74 years for men. This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. 

According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man. Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs.

Navigating Caregiving Duties

“With added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,” Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents.

A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000. Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments, lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men.

Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers. So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. 

10 Steps to Financial Independence

Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey.

Step 1: Define Your ""Why""

Defining your ""why"" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path.

Step 2: Assess Your Finances

Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence.

To assess your current financial situation: 

Start by tallying your monthly income from all sources, including your salary, side hustles, and any passive income streams. 
Next, list out your monthly expenses, making sure to account for both fixed costs like rent or mortgage payments, as well as variable expenses such as groceries and entertainment. 
Don't forget to factor in one-off annual bills, such as insurance premiums or property taxes, as these can significantly impact your overall financial picture.

Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages.

To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning.

Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time.

Step 3: Craft Your Financial Independence (FI) Number

Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number—an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions.

To determine this:

Estimate your annual retirement living expenses
Factor one-time goals like buying property
Increase for expected inflation over time
Calculate investable assets needed to generate that income

Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target.

Step 4: Automate Saving and Investing

“For individuals aspiring to achieve financial independence through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,” says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.” 

Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth. “Rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with financial goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to financial independence,” he adds.

He says investing may require the help of a team—a financial advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney—whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner.

Alternatively, DIY apps like Acorns, Betterment, Ellevest, and Wealthfront, among many others, offer set-it-and-forget-it retirement investing convenience.

Step 5: Create a Debt Repayment Plan

Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn’t derail the dream. 

“Achieving financial independence while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,” says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between “good” debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and ""bad"" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. 

Russell says, “Prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance financial security and accelerate the journey to independence.”

Minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can help with financial independence.

To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods:

Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid.

Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts.

Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first.

Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress.

Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free.

Step 6: Keep a Realistic Emergency Savings Fund

Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit.

Most experts advise stockpiling enough emergency savings to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. And whenever funds are low or living expenses increase, the savings target should shift to replenishment. 

Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap. Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. 

Step 7: Maximize Your Human Capital

Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms.

Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. 

Step 8: Build Multiple Income Streams

As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages:

Side hustles: Start a weekend freelancing business doing what you love. Drive for a rideshare service in your spare time. Monetize a hobby or talent.
Online businesses: Launch a digital product, YouTube channel, affiliate marketing blog, or dropshipping store. Multiple streams leveraging the internet scale easily.
Real estate: Invest in a rental property you can hire a manager to oversee. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) provide more passive real estate investing exposure too.
Equity investments: Build a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), etc. over time. Dividends and appreciation compound as the principal grows.

Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow.

Step 9: Manage Costs and Practice Intentional Spending

Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they’re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for.

“You can be very ruthless … don't spend money if it's not important to you,” says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? 

It's helpful to ask yourself, ""What will this purchase contribute to my life?"" before buying.

For the Watermans, traveling isn’t a luxury. It’s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper “why” and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans.

Step 10: Continuously Educate Yourself

Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades.

Read personal finance books, listen to financial independence podcasts, attend investment seminars, and join money-minded online communities. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will teach you new, useful skillsets, rather than discourage you from reaching for your goals. 

Also, work with a financial advisor—a fiduciary who crafts a holistic plan for you. Their expertise navigates optimized outcomes not possible alone. Investment pros protect wealth too —steering you away from emotional decision pitfalls novice investors succumb to.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How Long Does It Take to Achieve Financial Independence?

Timelines vary substantially based on factors like income, frugality, market returns, inheritance windfalls, etc. However, truly achieving FI generally takes decades for the average person.

The key is avoiding short-term scorekeeping and instead focusing on the right money mindsets and behaviors consistency over long time horizons. Marathon mentality perseveres.

Can You Still Become Financially Independent With Kids?

Absolutely! Children do reduce the free cash flow available to invest and delay retirement timelines. However, by sticking to financial independence principles and adjusting savings rates accordingly, parenthood and financial freedom can thrive together.

The key is balancing enjoying special moments with kids today while also sacrificing to fund their futures responsibly. Delayed life milestones like buying a bigger home may be needed but compound investing makes larger catch-up contributions later possible too.

What if Your Significant Other Isn’t on Board?

Pursuing financial independence often requires trade-offs and sacrifices that partners may not embrace or understand initially. Try framing benefits in terms of how achieving FI together unlocks greater family time and potential.

Start where you agree—identify shared dreams, areas of financial stress, and lifestyle upgrades you both want. Pursue small joint money wins together first before tackling bigger mindset shifts. Leading by example also influences over time.

Can Unexpected Events Derail Your Progress?

Job loss, health care issues, and market downturns happen. Life's hiccups test financial discipline and scrappy resilience. Having emergency savings, insurance protections and diverse income streams helps weather storms without surrendering long-term financial independence aims.

Remember, obstacles are inevitable. Progress over perfect financial steps moves you forward despite setbacks.

How Do Taxes Impact Financial Independence?

It's wise to take taxes into account but avoiding investing simply due to tax considerations means leaving substantial wealth unrealized. Focus first on maximizing returns through prudent investing based on risk, fees, diversification, etc.

Once assets grow, work with a financial advisor to legally minimize taxes where possible—contributing to retirement accounts, realizing losses, gifting appreciated assets, etc. Reducing taxes sustains more compound capital working toward your financial independence.

The Bottom Line

The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There’s more than one way to do this.

“I think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,” advises Konte. “In my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.” 

Russell reiterates that “while a high income can expedite financial independence, it's not a prerequisite.” Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families.

Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

Our Take

Fidelity remains our top overall choice for best online broker as well as our choice as the best broker for low costs and for ETFs this year. In addition, Fidelity earned top ranks as the best broker for cash management, which are new additions to our best online broker and trading platforms awards this year. 

Fidelity has excellent investment platforms for active traders and investors of all types, including mobile, desktop, and the downloadable Active Trader Pro. In contrast with competitors, fees are negligible and many services and products are fee-free. The platform’s investment assets include ETFs, mutual funds, options, cryptocurrency, and fixed-income products including U.S. Treasury, corporate, agency, municipal bonds, and CDs. Penny stocks and options trading require additional trading permission, while investors looking to trade currencies and international stocks will need an international account. Those seeking management, pre-packaged investment products, and access to rich banking features won’t be disappointed. 

FIdelity's research and educational tools are superior and suitable for nearly all investor levels. Portfolio analysis, tools, and calculators are good, although scattered across the platform. The only assets lacking on the platform are futures, options on futures, and commodities. 


EDITOR'S NOTE

In addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Fidelity Go.

Pros & Cons
Pros

Standout pricing for trading, products, and services

Superior trading platforms for all types of investors

Accessible and knowledgeable customer service

Extensive research and screeners

No payment for order flow on stocks and ETFs

Cons

Portfolio analysis and planning tools lack a centralized location

Virtual assistant needs improvement

Only two digital coins for trading

Pros Explained
Standout pricing for trading, products, and services: Many low-cost and fee-free mutual funds, fixed income, stocks, and ETFs are available for trading. Commission and margin rates are relatively low. Users can select from many free research reports. Numerous services are free, such as returned checks, account management, and more.
3
 
Superior trading platforms for all types of investors: For frequent, active, and advanced investors, Active Trader Pro aligns with the top trading platforms online. Access to mobile, desktop, and downloadable Active Trader Pro makes trading accessible for beginners through advanced investors. 
Accessible and knowledgeable customer service: Round-the-clock live customer service, specialized trading and fixed income customer service, and branch financial advisor access give customers quality help, seven days per week.
4
 
Extensive research and screeners: The breadth of third-party reports, along with quality rankings of the data, provides self-directed investors with superb research. The screeners, with scores of filters, give stock, ETF, mutual fund, fixed income, and options investors excellent asset selection tools.
No payment for order flow (PFOF) on stocks and ETFs: Some brokers earn money by accepting payments from market makers for directing equity and options orders to them, in a practice called payment for order flow (PFOF). Fidelity does not accept PFOF from market makers for equity and ETF trades.
5
 This is a critical reason why Fidelity is able to deliver top-tier order execution.
Cons Explained
Portfolio analysis and planning tools lack a centralized location: Users can link external accounts to the Fidelity Full View, Free Financial Plan, and Digital Portfolio summary. While these tools are useful, they don’t have a centralized home on the platform.
Virtual assistant needs improvement: Our trials with the virtual assistant were unsatisfactory. Fortunately, live help is easy to access. 
Only two digital coins for trading: Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only two coins available, along with several ETFs that trade spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. Serious cryptocurrency traders should seek a platform that caters to digital currency investors.

Usability

Fidelity has improved its website and user experience over the past few years. Desktop navigation is intuitive, while mobile use requires some trial and error to locate the features. Online account setup is straightforward and requires the typical demographic information and Social Security number. Self-directed investors benefit from a wide library of research tools and screeners. The platform provides expedient user access to trading through mobile, desktop web-based, and the downloadable Active Trader Pro. 

The mobile app works on Android, iOS, Amazon, and Google Assistant-enabled devices. The mobile trade screen is decent, with a company profile, detailed quote, price and earnings history, and analyst ratings. For research, screening, and other features, the desktop platform and Active Trader Pro are superior to mobile. New users can access educational videos and articles to familiarize themselves with the nuances of the platform. The Fidelity app is limited to active mobile investors.

Trade Experience

Trading at Fidelity is available via its web-based platform, downloadable software, and mobile apps, and is suitable for all investors including, beginners, and advanced active traders. The third-party research reports, graded on prior accuracy, and vast screening tools set up all investors with a wealth of corporate knowledge.

Mobile Trade Experience

For occasional traders and those keeping track of their assets, placing basic trades, reading news, depositing checks, and watching markets, the mobile app is fine. If you’re seeking a full-service and comprehensive trading experience, the Fidelity desktop or Active Trader Pro are suggested. 

On mobile, the Home screen displays portfolio value with a choice to view one month through three years of data. Accounts are listed, along with easy access to activity, individual positions, and forms. The menu is limited to Investing, Transact, Planning, and Discover options. 

The mobile trade experience is accessed through the Transact and Trade icons. Inputting the ticker for the security takes you to a comprehensive and detailed quote page. From there, choose the “Buy” or “Sell” button. Mobile order choices include limit, stop loss, stop limit, trailing stop loss, or stop limit (% or $). Approved options traders can transact basic options trades, but the desktop and Active Trader Pro are more comprehensive.

Range of Offerings

Fidelity has evolved into a full-service, low-fee, comprehensive platform with offerings for nearly all investors along with premier research.

How This Broker Makes Money From You and For You

Unlike many competitors, Fidelity does not receive payment for order flow from market makers for equity and ETF trades. Many products and services are fee-free. So, with the favorable low or no-fee structure, how does Fidelity make money?

Fidelity makes money from you via:

Interest on cash: Fidelity makes money from the difference between what it pays you on your idle cash or through money market mutual funds and what it earns from the cash balances. 
Stock loan programs: Fidelity earns revenue by loaning stocks in your account for short sales, with your permission, and it shares that income with you. 
Margin interest: Fidelity benefits from the interest received on margin lending. 
Fidelity Wealth Management: Those with more than $500,000 can hire credentialed Fidelity advisors for portfolio management. Fees range from 0.2% through 1.50% of AUM (assets under management) depending upon the account value.
14
 

Fidelity makes money for you with:

Savings on expedient trading: Previously discussed savings per trade
Specialty products such as SMA tax-advantaged accounts: Low-fee Fidelity-managed portfolios with tax savings
21
High yields: On money market mutual funds
22
 
Low or no transaction fees: Fee-free stock, ETF, and Fidelity mutual funds
Comparatively low margin rates: In comparison with the market average
23
No or low fees: On account management and services 
Stock loan programs: Earn income on stocks and ETFs that you own by lending them out. Earnings vary based on assets loaned and their value.
24
Account and Research Amenities

Fidelity’s screening and research capabilities are superior to the crowd and contribute to its Best Overall Brokerage and Trading Account Investopedia win. Read on for a window into Fidelity’s breadth of asset screeners, tools, calculators, news, research reports, and educational offers.

Stock Screeners

Fidelity's stock screener is so comprehensive that on occasion, it might be overwhelming. Those seeking pre-made screens can choose from the following strategies: Popular, Growth, Growth/Value, Value, Technical, and Income. The “most popular” strategies include another nine categories, from bargains, bottom-fishing, dividend payers, and growers to momentum and value stocks. Those seeking self-directed screening can pick from 26 criteria and set parameters according to their preferences.

ETF Screener

Investors can search ETFs by Fund Family, Market Cap, Sector, Fixed Income, Socially Responsible, Actively Managed, or Digital Assets. For more in-depth screening, there are an additional 86 criteria to manipulate. The ETF screening options span nearly any category an investor might want, including type, expense ratio, investment philosophy, objectives, trading characteristics, performance, fundamentals, technicals, and more.
25

Mutual Fund Screener 

Finding a comprehensive mutual fund screener is difficult, but Fidelity fills this need. With a pool of 9,330 mutual funds, its screener is among the best run by online brokerages. The pre-set mutual fund screeners for quick results include:
26

Asset Class and Category
Key Criteria including 5 choices: Fidelity Funds, Fidelity Picks, environmental-social-governance (ESG), Minimum Below $2,500, Actively Nanaged, or Index Funds 
Morningstar: Overall Star Ratings, Returns, Expenses

For in-depth screening, there are 32 additional screening criteria including those mutual funds that can be purchased with no transaction fees. 

Options Screener

LiveVol powers Fidelity’s option screener. Like Fidelity’s other screeners, users can choose from built-in scans or use their own criteria, such as volume, implied volatility, time spreads, and order flow. There are more than 25 predefined filters in Active Trader Pro, and there are nearly 200 individual criteria that can be incorporated into a search.

Crypto Screener

While Fidelity offers two coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, through a separate Fidelity crypto account, it does not offer cryptocurrency screening capabilities. Available comparison research for each digital coin includes detailed quotes and charts including price performance, market cap supply, and news. 

Fixed Income Screener

Fixed income assets including bonds, CDs, mutual funds, and ETFs are all accessed from the News & Research > Fixed Income menu. Investors hunting for CDs, corporate bonds, and Treasury bonds can scan a grid. With assets from CDs through all credit quality bonds listed down the Y axis and maturities on the X, users can view average interest rates and click on the match that fits their portfolio. For example, investors exploring five-year, A-rated corporate bonds will click on the intersection which shows the average interest payment is 5.44% today. By clicking on the interest rate, users are taken to a screen with a list of bonds that fit the criteria. All fixed-income assets have dropdown menus with additional screening capabilities. 

Tools and Calculators

The Fidelity Free Financial Plan enables self-directed investors to link external accounts, including spending, saving, debt, and investment accounts, to create a comprehensive, goal-based, financial plan. Embedded within the plan are calculators to guide your saving, debt payoff, goal, and retirement planning. Additionally, users can create a budget, view all of their holdings, and organize their finances with the “Fidelity Full View” tool.
27
 

Charting

Basic charts are available on mobile, desktop, and Active Trader Pro and can be customized for beginners through advanced investors and traders. Basic charting for beginner through intermediate investors includes primary indicators and timeline customizations. 

Technical and fundamental investors seeking advanced charting capabilities will gravitate towards Active Trader Pro, with its extensive customization and charting capabilities including display options, drawing tools, and scores of indicators.
28
 Users can select over 60 indicators, draw trendlines, and customize dates. Active day traders will also appreciate key tools for capturing price inefficiencies, such as the ability to place statistical bands on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) study. All but the most basic charting is best done on the desktop or Active Trader Pro platforms. 

Trading Idea Generators

Active Trader Pro is replete with tools to capture profitable trading ideas for options, day, and other types of traders. There are many educational videos on the website that delve into trading ideas. Several of the customizable tools on Active Trader Pro include the Strategy Ideas Tool, the Filters Tool, Technical Analysis, Charting, Social market, and Sentiment analyses. The Technical analysis tools are useful for trend analysis, with filters, and many other indicators such as volume, volatility, or momentum. All tools are customizable and have scores of filters to guide you in uncovering profitable trade ideas.
29
 

Three of the main trading idea generator tools on Fidelity Active Trader Pro include: 

Filters
Real-time analytics
Trade armor

With data updating in real time, the Fidelity platform is among the strongest platforms for active traders. 

News

Although News is a common feature on most investment platforms, Fidelity News & Guidance integrates a searchable and customizable Newsfeed with curated news from across the internet. News is categorized according to U.S. Markets and Economy, Company News, Technology, International, and Investing Ideas. Fidelity syndicates the most relevant news from major news sites from across the U.S. and internationally.
30
 The customized Newsfeed enables readers to filter each category by source, including Reuters, Benzinga, Kiplinger, and MT newswires, and various topics.
31

News topics include:

Economy
Investing
Investing: Bonds and CDs
Investing: Commodities
Investing: Stocks
Third-Party Research

Fidelity is among the few investment brokerage companies to provide a large, free third-party research library of stock reports for clients. After visiting the stock research tab and inputting a stock ticker, users are provided with a detailed quote page with six menu items including chart, dividends and earnings, sentiment, analyst rating, comparisons, and statistics. The analyst research selection delivers an average rating and roughly eight research reports from well-known providers such as Argus, Zacks, Ford, Refinitiv/Verus, and more. Accompanying the reports are Refinitiv StarMine Relative Accuracy scores that measure the relative historical accuracy of the firm's opinions versus a peer group over a 24-month period. Fidelity provides an additional 20 analyst opinions without a full report. 

Fractional Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)

At any point, investors can request that all share dividends be automatically reinvested into the asset. This practice compounds investment returns. Even fractional shares are purchased with a dividend repurchase request.
32
 

Cash Management

Clients at Fidelity are automatically enrolled in a cash sweep program, where the customer chooses among a selection of money market mutual funds. While the interest paid on this cash is not at the high-end of what is being offered by other brokers, at 2.69% as of August 2024, this still compares favorably with many of Fidelity’s peers, since they often offer negligible interest on cash balances.
33

It's also important to note that a strong cash management product is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It’s also about seamless integration with critical, no-fee banking features, and industry-leading insurance. In these areas, Fidelity’s cash management offering is unmatched, and it all comes with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs.

Investors seeking high cash management interest rates can elect to transfer their cash allocation to higher-yielding Fidelity Money Market Mutual Funds:
22

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX)
Fidelity Money Market Fund (SPRXX)
Fidelity Municipal Money Market Fund (FTEXX)
Portfolio Analysis

Fidelity has upped its game with a fully customized, self-directed Financial Planning Tool. This tool is similar to a basic financial plan one might receive from an investment advisor. After linking external accounts, you can view all of your investments in one place and gain guidance on managing spending, debt paydown, and investment analysis.
27
 For investing, you can input your goals and receive personalized investment strategy advice. 

Portfolio analysis tools deliver an analysis of your investment portfolio from asset allocation, top positions and ratings, stock, and fixed income screens. The Fidelity Full View tool also delves into your investment allocation across popular asset classes. These various tools, while all on the site, are not integrated into one portfolio analysis vertical, making access a bit of a challenge.


Investopedia's latest Reader Survey shows that, despite concerns about the election, inflation, and extended valuations, individual stocks remain survey respondents' the top investment choice if they had an extra $10,000 to spend.

Education

From the News & Research menu tab, scroll down to the Learn tab for access to the wide range of educational offers. The main menu spans:

Financial essentials
Life events
Investing and trading
Investment products
Advanced trading 

Additional categories cover expert insights, money tips, women, and Wealth Management Insights. Within each category, users will find articles, videos, Webinars, and question-and-answer sessions. Educational features include guides about how to use the Fidelity website as well as broad financial topics. You can also find advice about advisor access and special events.
34
 

Customer Service

Comparable to many large financial firms, Fidelity provides a 24/7 Virtual Assistant and phone customer service. Live chat is available seven days per week during normal business hours. The Help Center and YouTube channel answer most user questions. The crypto help desk is designed to answer your digital currency questions. The fixed-income desk helps bond investors.
4

For additional support, check out Fidelity’s Reddit, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Discord profiles. You’ll receive answers there from social media customer service managers.

This insurance protects your money should Fidelity fail or go bankrupt, not against losses in the investment markets. Cash accounts are also insured through the FDIC up to $250,000 per account.
39
 

Transparency

Fidelity receives high marks for transparency. Fees and pricing are readily available on the platform. The trading technology and share price improvement are shown on individual orders and over time. Fidelity is the only firm to report full price improvement using the Financial Information Forum (FIF) standards.
17
 Phone, chat, help, and FAQ assistance ensure that investors receive all the information they need in a timely manner.

The Bottom Line

Fidelity distinguishes itself as Investopedia’s winner of Best Overall, Best Broker for ETFs, and Best Broker for Low Costs, in addition to being the best broker for cash management. All levels of investors and traders will find products and services for successful investing and money management. Individual investors will be hard-pressed to find a better broker for research and screening tools. Cost-conscious investors value the negligible or no-fee structure on many products and services. For education and live customer service, either by phone or in person at a branch, users can receive guidance on investing strategies, money management, and Fidelity platform help. The bottom line is that Fidelity is a superior investment broker for all but the professional trader. The only complaint is that with the wide wealth of products and services, it might take users a bit of time to grasp all of the platform’s offers.

How We Picked the Best Online Brokers and Trading Platforms

Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of online brokers and trading platforms is a top priority for Investopedia. We combined our industry research, subject matter expertise, and investor survey data to guide the research and weightings for our 2024 online broker awards. To collect the data, we sent a digital survey with 110 questions to each of the 26 companies we included in our rubric. Additionally, our team of researchers verified the survey responses and collected any missing data points through online research and conversations with each company directly. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 19 to March 19, 2024.

We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 89 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories:


Additionally, during our 2024 research, many of the companies we reviewed gave us live demonstrations of their platforms and services via video conferencing methods and also granted our team of expert writers and editors access to live accounts so they could perform hands-on testing.

Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top online brokers and trading platforms.

importance of mindset in financial health,investopedia,How to Reach Financial Freedom: 12 Habits to Get You There,"Learn the 12 habits of financial freedom, including basic budgeting, debt reduction, automatic savings, financial education, and smart maintenance.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112015/these-10-habits-will-help-you-reach-financial-freedom.asp,"Financial freedom—having enough savings, investments, and cash on hand to afford the lifestyle you want for yourself and your family—is an important goal for many people. It also means budgeting to grow a nest egg that will allow you to retire or pursue any career you want—without being driven by the need to earn a certain amount each year.

Unfortunately, too many people fall far short of financial freedom. Even without occasional financial emergencies, escalating debt due to overspending is a constant burden that keeps them from reaching their goals. When a major crisis—such as a hurricane, an earthquake, or a pandemic—completely disrupts all plans, additional holes in safety nets are revealed.

Trouble happens to nearly everyone, but these 12 habits can put you on the right path.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Set life goals—big and small, financial and lifestyle—and create a blueprint for achieving those goals.
Make a budget to cover all your financial needs and stick to it.
Pay off credit cards in full, carry as little debt as possible, and keep an eye on your credit score.
Create automatic savings by setting up an emergency fund and contributing to your employer’s retirement plan.
Take care of your belongings—maintenance is cheaper than replacement—but most importantly, take care of your health.
Being Financially Independent

Being financially independent means having sufficient income, savings, or investments to live comfortably for life and meet all of one's obligations without relying on a paycheck. That is the ultimate goal of a long-term financial plan.

1. Set Life Goals

What is financial freedom to you? Everyone has a general desire for it, but that's too vague a goal. You need to get specific about amounts and deadlines. The more specific your goals, the higher the likelihood of achieving them.

Write down these three objectives:

What your lifestyle requires
How much you should have in your bank account to make that possible
What age is the deadline to save that amount

Next, count backward from your deadline age to your current age and establish financial mileposts at regular intervals between the two dates. Write all amounts and deadlines down carefully and put the goal sheet at the front of your financial binder.

2. Make a Monthly Budget

Making a monthly household budget—and sticking to it—is the best way to guarantee that all bills are paid and savings are on track. It’s also a regular routine that reinforces your goals and bolsters resolve against the temptation to splurge.

3. Pay off Credit Cards in Full

Credit cards and other high-interest consumer loans are toxic to wealth-building. Make it a point to pay off the full balance each month. Student loans, mortgages, and similar loans typically have much lower interest rates; paying them off is not an emergency. However, paying these lower-interest loans on time is still important—and on-time payments will build a good credit rating.

4. Create Automatic Savings

Pay yourself first. Enroll in your employer’s retirement plan and make full use of any matching contribution benefit, which is essentially free money. It’s also wise to have an automatic withdrawal into an emergency fund, which can be tapped for unexpected expenses, as well as an automatic contribution to a brokerage account or something similar.

Ideally, the money for the emergency fund and the retirement fund should be pulled out of your account the same day you receive your paycheck, so it never even touches your hands.

Keep in mind that the recommended amount to save in an emergency fund depends on your individual circumstances. Also, tax-advantaged retirement accounts come with rules that make it difficult to get your hands on your cash should you suddenly need it, so that account should not be your only emergency fund.

5. Start Investing Now

Bad stock markets—known as bear markets—can make people question the wisdom of investing, but historically there has been no better way to grow your money. The magic of compound interest alone will grow your money exponentially, but you do need a lot of time to achieve meaningful growth.

However, remember that—for everyone except professional investors—it would be a mistake to attempt the kind of stock picking made famous by billionaires like Warren Buffett. Instead, open an online brokerage account that makes it easy for you to learn how to invest, create a manageable portfolio, and make weekly or monthly contributions to it automatically. We’ve ranked the best online brokers for beginners to help you get started.

Achieving financial freedom can be very difficult in the face of growing debt, cash emergencies, medical issues, and overspending, but—with discipline and careful planning—it is possible. That is the ultimate goal of

6. Watch Your Credit Score

Your credit score is a very important number that determines the interest rate you are offered when buying a new car or refinancing a home. It also impacts the amount you pay for a range of other essentials, from car insurance to life insurance premiums.

The reason credit scores have so much weight is that someone with reckless financial habits is considered likely to be reckless in other areas of life, such as not looking after their health—or even driving and drinking.

This is why it’s important to get a credit report at regular intervals to make sure that there are no erroneous black marks ruining your good name. It may also be worth looking into a reputable credit monitoring service to protect your information.

7. Negotiate for Goods and Services

Many Americans are hesitant to negotiate for goods and services, because they're afraid that it makes them seem cheap. Conquer this fear and you could save thousands each year. Small businesses, in particular, tend to be open to negotiation, so buying in bulk or positioning yourself as a repeat customer can open the door to good discounts.

8. Stay Educated on Financial Issues

Review relevant changes in tax law to ensure that all adjustments and deductions are maximized each year. Keep up with financial news and developments in the stock market and do not hesitate to adjust your investment portfolio accordingly. Knowledge is also the best defense against fraudsters who prey on unsophisticated investors to turn a quick buck.

9. Maintain Your Property

Taking good care of property makes everything from cars and lawnmowers to shoes and clothes last longer. The cost of maintenance is a fraction of the cost of replacement, so it’s an investment not to be missed.

Learn to know the difference between the things you want and the things you need.

10. Live Below Your Means

Mastering a frugal lifestyle means developing a mindset focused on living a good life with less—and it's easier than you think. In fact, before rising to affluence, many wealthy individuals developed the habit of living below their means.

This isn’t a challenge to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. It simply means learning to distinguish between the things you need and the things you want—and then making small adjustments that drive big gains for your financial health.

11. Get a Financial Advisor 

Once you’ve gotten to a point where you’ve amassed a decent amount of wealth—either liquid assets (cash or anything easily converted to cash) or fixed assets (property or anything not easily converted to cash)—get a financial advisor to help you stay on the right path.

12. Take Care of Your Health

The principle of proper maintenance also applies to your body—and taking excellent care of your physical health has a significant positive impact on your financial health as well.

Investing in good health is not difficult. It means making regular visits to doctors and dentists, and following health advice about any problems you encounter. Many medical issues can be helped—or even prevented—with basic lifestyle changes, such as more exercise and a healthier diet.

Poor health maintenance, on the other hand, has both immediate and long-term negative consequences on your financial goals. Some companies have limited sick days, which means a loss of income once paid days are used up. Obesity and other dietary illnesses make insurance premiums skyrocket, and poor health may force early retirement with lower monthly income for the rest of your life.

What Is Financial Freedom?

Everyone defines financial freedom in terms of their own goals. For most people, it means having the financial cushion (savings, investments, and cash) to afford a certain lifestyle—plus a nest egg for retirement or the freedom to pursue any career without the need to earn a certain salary.

What Is the 50/30/20 Budget Rule?

The 50/30/20 budget rule, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is a guideline to achieve financial stability by dividing after-tax income into 3 categories of spending: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and paying down debt. We have built an easy-to-follow budgeting calculator to help you categorize and control your spending and saving—which is the essential first step toward financial freedom.

Will a Bad Credit Score Make My Car Insurance Higher?

Although some states—including California, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, and Michigan—limit or prohibit the use of credit scores to determine auto insurance rates, many companies do use a credit-based scoring system to decide whether to insure you and how much you will pay.1

The Bottom Line

These 12 steps won’t solve all your money problems, but they will help you develop the good habits that get you on the path to financial freedom. Simply making a plan with specific target amounts and dates reinforces your resolve to reach your goal and guards you against the temptation to overspend. Once you start to make real progress, relief from the constant pressure of escalating debt and the promise of a nest egg for retirement kick in as powerful motivators—and financial freedom is in your sights."

Here's how to set financial independence goals and achieve them, whether you want to retire early, live abroad, or reduce stress.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-achieve-financial-independence-8647093,"A growing number of women say that achieving financial independence is their No. 1 financial goal, according to a Fidelity Investments Survey. Fifty-eight percent of women surveyed said that they wanted to feel secure and not worry about money.1

However, only 36% of respondents to REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's 2024 Her Money Mindset survey said that they held a retirement account, while only 71% said they held a savings account. And 54% said that they struggled to pay at least one major expense.

What Is Financial Independence?

“Financial independence means different things to different people,” says Walter Russell, an Ohio-based financial planner. “Some see it as (being) free from needing a regular job because they have money from other sources. Others think of it as not owing money to anyone, which makes them feel secure and in control.” 

Russell continues, “For some, it's about being prepared for retirement and knowing they'll be okay financially when they stop working. It can also mean having the freedom to start businesses or live wherever they want. It's all about feeling confident and in charge of your money and future.”

No matter your definition of financial independence, your end goal probably looks like freedom and autonomy. Your path to that destination will vary depending on your values, resources, and preferences.

Financial Self-Sufficiency

At a basic level, financial independence means having sufficient income and savings to cover living expenses. If you're financially self-sufficient, you have the resources to fund cost of living. 

For Brock and Becky Waterman, better known as the FIRE Travel Family, financial independence meant pulling off a wedding on a shoestring budget, selling their home, and leveraging geographic arbitrage to live on less—even with three kids in tow. 

“[During COVID] I ran the numbers to see where we were, and we figured out if we sold our house and most of our [possessions] and our vehicles...we could go ahead and be financially independent and not have to work,"" says Brock Waterman. 

After cutting health care costs (almost $2,000 per month because the Watermans owned their own business), child care costs (almost $15,000 per year), and property taxes and insurance, the Watermans had reduced their expenses by more than half. 

Originally from Wisconsin, Waterman says that living in an RV and homeschooling their kids is an unconventional choice for his family. But they were motivated to spend more time with their kids; financial self-sufficiency helped them achieve their goal. 

While some people aim for financial independence by working for many years to amass significant savings, the Watermans chose to do the opposite and cut expenses in order to enjoy life now. Dividend-paying stocks, some savings, and a few certificates of deposit have sustained the family thus far, making their decision to travel the world with their kids a no-brainer.

Freedom From Employment

Many associate financial independence with not needing traditional full-time employment or a paycheck. Passive income and dividend assets can help power financial independence plans.

“Investing 10-15% of gross income for retirement and putting another 20% of your after-tax income toward investing or other financial goals is a fantastic, back-of-the-envelope calculation for most people,” says Anna N’Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner and president of Re-Envision Wealth, when asked what steps she advises people to take to achieve financial independence.  

While some people can live on savings alone, most have to consider ways they could access cash fast if their circumstances change. Being self-employed or willing to work in a high-demand field as needs arise can make financial independence more accessible even without amassing much savings.

Autonomy Over Amounts

Most people think that financial independence requires a high net worth or large windfall. Konte says financial independence is achievable at lower income levels, too.

“Many financial planning studies show that in some respects it's actually easier to reach financial independence when you are middle-income because Social Security makes up a greater percentage of your retirement income need, therefore you need to save less of a nest egg on your own,” she says.

Brock Waterman agrees. He encourages people aiming for financial independence not to focus on a target savings or investing number. “When we worked for ourselves, we were paying a little over $2,000 a month, so $24,000 a year, for health care,” he says. 

After Becky Waterman closed her massage business and he stopped working, they were able to access subsidized health care because they make less annual income. Brock Waterman estimates that they paid $3,000 or $4,000 for premiums the first year. This year, he says, the family paid only a few hundred dollars on health care.  

Three years into financial independence, he encourages people to take the leap if they really want it, rather than waiting to hit a specific set number goal.

Building Long-Term Security

Whether it is fear of an emergency or ambitions to send kids and grandkids to college, long-term security can keep people locked into income-generating jobs that they don’t love. But financial security is just as much about what you want to spend your money on as it is about what you don’t.

For example, the Watermans decided against saving for four-year college educations for their kids. Instead, their long-term vision includes setting aside $10,000 to $15,000 per kid to invest in their vocational training, skills building, or launching their own business. 

“They'll have the money for community college, and if they decide they want to go to a four-year college, that's going to be something they're going to have to make a decision for themselves,” Waterman explains. 

Russell adds that discipline in saving, investing, and living below one's means plays a more significant role regardless of income level. 

“Focus on increasing the savings rate and maximizing investment returns through strategic allocation,” he advises. “High-income earners should avoid lifestyle inflation and prioritize long-term wealth accumulation through prudent financial management and investment strategies.” 

Those building blocks of financial discipline ensure financial independence for the long haul.

Why Women Can Benefit Greatly From Financial Independence

While financial independence serves everyone, research shows it holds special significance for women, who typically earn less than men, live longer, and have greater caregiving responsibilities.

According to 2022 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women employed full-time and year-round had median earnings of $52,360, while the median earnings for men employed full-time and year-round were $62,350.2

REAL SIMPLE and Investopedia's survey data shows a gender wage gap within marriages, too: 60% percent of women respondents with a male partner said that they earned less than their significant other. 


While progress has been made over time in closing this gender wage gap, the disparities between the earnings of men and women persist. 

Women Live Longer 

The latest data from The World Bank shows that in 2021,  life expectancy at birth was 79 years for women3 in the United States and 74 years for men.4 This represents a 5-year difference, with women having a higher life expectancy compared to men. Yet lower wages and long stints without income due to child rearing and caregiving put women at risk of having less cash during their golden years. 

According to estimates from Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old woman can expect to spend about $157,500 more on medical bills throughout retirement than the average 65-year-old man.5 Longer female life expectancies correlate with a need for larger retirement savings and income to cover additional years of living expenses and health care costs.

Navigating Caregiving Duties

“With added responsibility comes additional costs and cash flow pressure,” Konte adds. Women disproportionately shoulder unpaid caregiving duties for children and adult dependents.

A 2023 MetLife study found that most caregivers are women, and women providing care to a parent lose as much as $120,000 in lifetime wages due to working fewer hours. If a woman leaves the workforce entirely to provide care, the study found the lost wages rise to around $142,000.6 Caregiving for kids, spouses, and parents contributes to career impediments, lower savings, and higher out-of-pocket care expenses for women than men.

Research from AARP shows that Latinx and Black caregivers spend higher percentages of their income on care expenses than white caregivers.7 So, whether it's earning power, longevity, or caregiving norms, women encounter unique financial challenges that make financial independence difficult to achieve but even more meaningful for disrupting cycles of inequality. 

10 Steps to Financial Independence

Achieving financial freedom rests on embracing an intentional money mindset, goal-focused strategies, and smart financial behaviors over time. It's a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix. Here are 10 key steps that are an important part of any financial independence journey.

Step 1: Define Your ""Why""

Defining your ""why"" gives meaning and motivation to stay disciplined while working toward your unique vision of financial freedom. Whatever your answer, revisit this when you need inspiration to stick to the path.

Step 2: Assess Your Finances

Gaining clarity around your current financial situation identifies opportunities for improvement and savings needed to reach independence.

To assess your current financial situation: 

Start by tallying your monthly income from all sources, including your salary, side hustles, and any passive income streams. 
Next, list out your monthly expenses, making sure to account for both fixed costs like rent or mortgage payments, as well as variable expenses such as groceries and entertainment. 
Don't forget to factor in one-off annual bills, such as insurance premiums or property taxes, as these can significantly impact your overall financial picture.

Once you have a clear understanding of your income and expenses, it's time to calculate your assets and liabilities. Your assets include any savings accounts, investment portfolios, and property values. On the other hand, your liabilities encompass all forms of debt, such as credit card balances, student loans, and mortgages.

To calculate your net worth, subtract total liabilities from total assets. This formula provides a snapshot of your current financial health and can serve as a baseline for setting future financial goals. Understanding your tax scenarios is also crucial, as this can influence your investment strategies and overall financial planning.

Doing a thorough assessment may uncover excess spending that could be saved or invested to reach financial independence sooner. This intelligence becomes the baseline to set goals against and track progress over time.

Step 3: Craft Your Financial Independence (FI) Number

Although the Watermans discourage it, many people start their financial independence journey by coming up with a number—an ideal savings, investing, or net worth number that would make them feel that full-time work was truly optional. Quantifying your number motivates saving and investing decisions.

To determine this:

Estimate your annual retirement living expenses
Factor one-time goals like buying property
Increase for expected inflation over time
Calculate investable assets needed to generate that income

Although the future remains unpredictable, having an estimate keeps your financial behaviors aligned with your target.

Step 4: Automate Saving and Investing

“For individuals aspiring to achieve financial independence through investing, several fundamental principles can guide their journey,” says Russell. Starting early and investing consistently harnesses the power of compounding returns over time.” 

Diversify investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk and improve long-term growth. “Rebalancing the portfolio periodically ensures alignment with financial goals and risk tolerance. Continual education about investing strategies and market dynamics empowers individuals to make informed decisions and adapt to changing circumstances on their path to financial independence,” he adds.

He says investing may require the help of a team—a financial advisor, a tax strategist, and an attorney—whose expertise can help you achieve financial independence even sooner.

Alternatively, DIY apps like Acorns, Betterment, Ellevest, and Wealthfront, among many others, offer set-it-and-forget-it retirement investing convenience.

Step 5: Create a Debt Repayment Plan

Some definitions of financial independence entail being completely debt-free. But, for some people, debt doesn’t derail the dream. 

“Achieving financial independence while maintaining debt is possible but requires strategic management and prudent decision-making,” says Russell. He says it's essential to differentiate between “good” debt, such as mortgages or student loans, and ""bad"" debt, like high-interest credit card debt. 

Russell says, “Prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt while leveraging low-interest debt strategically can be a viable approach. However, minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can enhance financial security and accelerate the journey to independence.”

Minimizing debt levels or achieving debt-free status can help with financial independence.

To create a repayment strategy, there are two popular options: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche methods:

Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debt while putting any extra funds toward the smallest balance first. Once the first debt is cleared, roll its minimum toward the next smallest, and so on until all are repaid.

Momentum builds as small wins pile up. This mental boost keeps you tackling larger debts.

Debt Avalanche: With this method, arrange debts by interest rate instead of size. Make minimum payments on all while targeting extra funds at the debt with the highest interest rate first.

Paying down high rates saves money on expensive financing charges over time. However, it may take longer to see progress.

Choose the approach that best fits your financial personality and needs. The main thing is sticking to the repayment plan until you're debt-free.

Step 6: Keep a Realistic Emergency Savings Fund

Life happens. You never know when you'll be hit with unexpected home repairs, job losses, or health issues. Having accessible cash reserves prevents resorting to high-interest debt when surprises hit.

Most experts advise stockpiling enough emergency savings to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses.8 And whenever funds are low or living expenses increase, the savings target should shift to replenishment. 

Set up automatic monthly transfers to hit the target amount in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured account, preferably a high-yield savings account that you can easily tap.9 Once you meet your emergency savings target, redirect automated flows toward investing instead. 

Step 7: Maximize Your Human Capital

Your most valuable financial asset remains human capital. Your ability to earn over your working years through high-income skills can make financial independence even easier to achieve. Pursue education (even financial and investing education), as well as consulting or freelancing opportunities that allow you to boost your income on your terms.

Carving out time for professional development keeps your skillset marketable, even if you never choose to work again. 

Step 8: Build Multiple Income Streams

As you expand skills and connections, create diversified income channels versus relying solely on salaries and wages:

Side hustles: Start a weekend freelancing business doing what you love. Drive for a rideshare service in your spare time. Monetize a hobby or talent.
Online businesses: Launch a digital product, YouTube channel, affiliate marketing blog, or dropshipping store. Multiple streams leveraging the internet scale easily.
Real estate: Invest in a rental property you can hire a manager to oversee. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) provide more passive real estate investing exposure too.
Equity investments: Build a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), etc. over time. Dividends and appreciation compound as the principal grows.

Mixing multiple income sources protects against disruption and risk while compounding overall cash flow.

Step 9: Manage Costs and Practice Intentional Spending

Big wins also come from the cost side of your cash flow equation. Small cost savings add up. The Watermans believe in frugality, not because they’re penny pinchers but because they are intentional about what they pay for.

“You can be very ruthless … don't spend money if it's not important to you,” says Brock Waterman. Ask yourself if every expenditure moves you toward independence goals and greater life satisfaction. Does buying another pair of shoes bring lasting value? Or does a trip create deeper connections? 

It's helpful to ask yourself, ""What will this purchase contribute to my life?"" before buying.

For the Watermans, traveling isn’t a luxury. It’s part of their financial independence plan. Traveling to low-cost-of-living areas means they spend money on memorable adventures while world-schooling their kids. Intentional spending aligns with the deeper “why” and prevents lifestyle creep from diluting bigger life plans.

Step 10: Continuously Educate Yourself

Reaching financial independence requires lifelong learning and growth. Mastering money mechanics, investing nuances, and tax optimization strategies greatly accelerate your outcomes over decades.

Read personal finance books, listen to financial independence podcasts, attend investment seminars, and join money-minded online communities. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will teach you new, useful skillsets, rather than discourage you from reaching for your goals. 

Also, work with a financial advisor—a fiduciary who crafts a holistic plan for you. Their expertise navigates optimized outcomes not possible alone. Investment pros protect wealth too —steering you away from emotional decision pitfalls novice investors succumb to.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How Long Does It Take to Achieve Financial Independence?

Timelines vary substantially based on factors like income, frugality, market returns, inheritance windfalls, etc. However, truly achieving FI generally takes decades for the average person.

The key is avoiding short-term scorekeeping and instead focusing on the right money mindsets and behaviors consistency over long time horizons. Marathon mentality perseveres.

Can You Still Become Financially Independent With Kids?

Absolutely! Children do reduce the free cash flow available to invest and delay retirement timelines. However, by sticking to financial independence principles and adjusting savings rates accordingly, parenthood and financial freedom can thrive together.

The key is balancing enjoying special moments with kids today while also sacrificing to fund their futures responsibly. Delayed life milestones like buying a bigger home may be needed but compound investing makes larger catch-up contributions later possible too.

What if Your Significant Other Isn’t on Board?

Pursuing financial independence often requires trade-offs and sacrifices that partners may not embrace or understand initially. Try framing benefits in terms of how achieving FI together unlocks greater family time and potential.

Start where you agree—identify shared dreams, areas of financial stress, and lifestyle upgrades you both want. Pursue small joint money wins together first before tackling bigger mindset shifts. Leading by example also influences over time.

Can Unexpected Events Derail Your Progress?

Job loss, health care issues, and market downturns happen. Life's hiccups test financial discipline and scrappy resilience. Having emergency savings, insurance protections and diverse income streams helps weather storms without surrendering long-term financial independence aims.

Remember, obstacles are inevitable. Progress over perfect financial steps moves you forward despite setbacks.

How Do Taxes Impact Financial Independence?

It's wise to take taxes into account but avoiding investing simply due to tax considerations means leaving substantial wealth unrealized. Focus first on maximizing returns through prudent investing based on risk, fees, diversification, etc.

Once assets grow, work with a financial advisor to legally minimize taxes where possible—contributing to retirement accounts, realizing losses, gifting appreciated assets, etc. Reducing taxes sustains more compound capital working toward your financial independence.

The Bottom Line

The first step to achieving financial independence is defining what it means for you. True independence requires a shift to intentional money mindsets and habits over time. There’s more than one way to do this.

“I think it's important for folks to work toward multiple financial goals at once,” advises Konte. “In my opinion, retirement investing should be a nonnegotiable that we are always working toward regardless of our other financial goals. The amount will vary depending on your cash flow needs, but we should always try to do both.” 

Russell reiterates that “while a high income can expedite financial independence, it's not a prerequisite.” Smart and consistent money management, even with the assistance of a skilled team of advisors, can unlock financial independence for some families.

Each money milestone compounds into greater agency to determine how you spend your time. Financial independence tends to deliver time and geographic independence too, which offers value well beyond dollars and cents.

Term of the Week: Goodwill

This week's term comes to us from Rushana Wiederhull, who sent us an email suggesting 'goodwill' for this week's term. And we like that term because it shows up in mergers and acquisitions news all the time. According to my favorite website, goodwill is an intangible asset that is associated with the purchase of one company by another. It represents value that can give the acquiring company a competitive advantage.

Specifically, a goodwill definition is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The value of a company’s name, brand reputation, loyal customer base, solid customer service, good employee relations, and proprietary technology represent aspects of goodwill. This value is why one company may pay a premium for another.

But we also sometimes see what is known as goodwill impairment. Impairment of an asset occurs when the market value of the asset drops below its historical cost. This can occur as a result on an adverse event, such as declining cash flows, increase in the competitive environment, or an economic depression, among many other reasons.

Good suggestion, Rushana!

effective budgeting techniques for savings,investopedia,Budgeting Calculator,This free budgeting calculator shows how to divide your income between savings and spending.,https://www.investopedia.com/budgeting-calculator-5101411,"A Monthly Budgeting Calculator to Help Take Control of Your Finances

Are you struggling to keep your spending below your income? Do you strategize about how to increase your savings? Our free budgeting calculator will help you save time and avoid mistakes when you need to understand where your money is going every month.

How the Budgeting Calculator Works 

To use our free budgeting calculator, just enter your monthly income and expenses. We’ll show you what percentage of your income you’re spending (or saving) in each category and whether you’re living within or beyond your means.

The output from using the budgeting calculator shows the percentage of your income that goes toward each category. Seeing the results in pie-chart form makes it easy to tell where most of your money goes. It breaks down your total monthly income and total monthly expenses while displaying the percentages of your income that are spent in specific areas. And it shows the total monthly funds that remain after you've accounted for all those expenses. The bigger the gap, the more extra funds you may have.

Key Components of a Budget Calculation

The categories below offer a basic framework that you can use to organize your expenses and think about the amounts that might be reasonable for you in each category. Everyone’s finances are different, and this calculator is a tool to help you, so use it in the way that makes the most sense for how you think about your money. You don’t have to allocate your expenses exactly as we describe.

Start by filling in the budgeting calculator with your real expenses. If some are uneven (you buy more clothes some months than others), calculate an annual average. Take a screenshot of the results. Then see how you can improve your remaining monthly funds by adjusting expenses that are discretionary—what budget experts call ""wants."" Where are your savings opportunities?

Total Monthly Income

Make sure to use your after-tax income for the whole family here—your budget is about the money you have available to spend. This should include your income from wages and salaries, gig work or part-time jobs, bonuses, child support, alimony, tips, Social Security, distributions, settlements, and any other sources of income.

Housing

Four walls, a floor, and a roof comprise most people’s biggest expense. A common rule of thumb is to limit housing costs to 30% of your income. For many households this is a challenge: Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies considers a household “moderately cost-burdened” when housing costs 31% to 49% of income, and “severely cost-burdened” when housing takes up 50% or more of income. In 2021, about 23% of U.S. households were cost burdened.1 Include your rent or mortgage payment in this category as well as renter’s insurance or homeowners insurance. Homeowners will also include any maintenance fees in this category.

Electricity, natural gas, water service, trash pickup, and the like are added together and go into this category. It can be hard to make a dent in these monthly bills without significant changes to your energy use, and some of those changes require upfront investments that take a long time to pay off, such as energy-efficient light bulbs, appliances, and heating and cooling systems. Caulking and weather stripping to seal gaps around doors and windows is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to achieve savings here, even if you’re not handy and on a tight budget.

Line items like property taxes or homeowners association fees can fill in the other area, including any other housing-related costs that need to be counted.

Food

In this category, add your essential groceries for the whole family. Add in any prepared meal kits and restaurant meals. Don't forget to account for takeout deliveries.

Transportation

The average household spent $12,295 on transportation in 2022 (the most recently available data), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average income before taxes was $94,003, meaning the average person’s transportation spending takes up 11.6% of their income.2 In this category, you’ll include costs such as public transit, car payments, auto insurance, parking, tolls, and gasoline or fuel. If you use taxis and ride-sharing services, be sure to add those into the line item for other/miscellaneous expenses, along with any additional transportation expenses.

Education

Many people have no education expenses. Others are funding their children’s (or grandchildren’s) education or paying back student loans. There’s no rule of thumb for the percentage of your budget that should go toward schooling. Good options for keeping these costs down include creating a 529 savings plan and refinancing private student loans.

Personal and Family

If you have dependents, include expenses here that you haven’t already included in other categories. These might be costs for cellphone bills, clothes and shoes, household supplies, and vacation planning funds. Do you spend money on entertainment? Account for streaming services, museum and fitness memberships, and tickets to events in this section. Personal care (haircuts, toiletries, manicures) and pet care (vet visits, pet food, pet insurance) can also go in this category.

Debt payments outside of mortgages and student loans should go in this section. This involves adding together credit cards and personal loan payments. Add in costs such as child care, adult day care, tutoring and lessons, and charitable donations into the ""other"" section.

Healthcare

Medical, dental, and vision care insurance premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance or copays should go in this category, along with any medications (prescription and over-the-counter ones) and medical devices you use. Your premiums will be the same every month, but the other expenses can fluctuate depending on whether you get sick, need a health screening, require new glasses, or something else. Use past spending or make your best guess at your annual cost in this category, then divide by 12.

Savings and Investments

If your income allows for it, a good rule of thumb is to allocate 20% of your income to savings and investments. In addition to keeping cash in the bank for emergencies, you should funnel money into a tax-advantaged retirement account for investments. If you’ve covered those bases, you might allocate extra money to a college savings account, save for a down payment on a home, or funnel money to a taxable brokerage account in which you hold tax-free or low-tax investments, such as municipal bonds and Treasury securities. You can use the ""other"" section for any additional savings goals you might have.

Budgeting Techniques and Philosophies

Here are some helpful methods for creating a personal spending plan. Would one of these work for you?

50/30/20 Method

This method says you should aim to spend roughly 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and investments. If you live with your parents or have a paid-off mortgage, you might spend less on needs and more on wants and savings. If your housing takes up 50% of your income, you’ll have to spend less on wants and possible savings. You can adjust the percentages to suit your situation; the idea is to take a big-picture approach to your spending instead of nitpicking every category.

80/20 Method

For this method, you save and invest 20% of your income, then spend the other 80% however you want. It’s an even simpler method than the 50/30/20 method. It can work well for people who don’t have the time or desire to account for their expenses in detail. You can change the numbers to achieve your own savings goals. People who want to achieve financial independence and retire early—or those who are trying to catch up on retirement savings later in life—might use a 70/30, 60/40, or 50/50 split.

Zero-based Budgeting

A zero-based budget assigns a purpose to every last dollar of your income. When you subtract your savings and expenses from your income, the result will be zero. It’s helpful for people who prefer something more detailed than the 50/30/20 or 80/20 methods. If your income and expenses are complicated (for example, you have multiple, variable sources of income and more than 100 expenses per month), this method may be too time-consuming for you.

The Envelope System

If you use this budgeting system, you’ll allocate a specific amount of money to each budget category at the beginning of the month. When you’ve spent what you’ve allocated to a category, you’re done for the month, unless you can move money out of another category. For example, if your electric bill is $100 and you only put $80 in your literal or figurative electricity envelope, you’ll have to take $20 out of the grocery envelope (or some other envelope). 

The envelope system is a good method for people who are on a tight budget or trying to stop overspending. It originated with the idea of literally putting cash in envelopes, but you can keep your cash safely in the bank and use software or a pencil and paper instead.

It's easy to get off track if you don't follow a budget when you make one. Tech tools for budgeting can help make tracking a budget easier—even fun. Find a budgeting app or budgeting software that you find easy and helpful to use.

Benefits of Using a Budget

Budgeting adds one more thing to your to-do list, and who has time for that? You should, because the extra time and effort it takes to make a budget are worth it. For the skeptics, here are four main benefits of budgeting.

Benefit 1: Maximize your returns from working—You probably spend 20 to 50 hours a week earning money. If you’re not spending and saving consciously and carefully, you’re not getting the maximum benefit from the time you spend working. That means you’re probably going to spend even more time working and less time enjoying friends, family, hobbies, and sleep.
Benefit 2: Gain a sense of control—It’s easy to feel like expenses are happening to you, especially if money is tight. Planning your budget at the beginning of every month can make you feel like you’re choosing where your money goes. It can also help you see where you might be able to make room for saving more or paying down debt faster so that unexpected costs become less likely to set you way back.
Benefit 3: Achieve your goals—You might have a goal of traveling to Tokyo, buying a car, or becoming a one-income household instead of a two-income household. Whatever motivates you, budgeting can help you get there by helping you set financial goals and prioritize where your money is going.
Benefit 4: Spot problems before they catch you off guard—When you create a budget, you’ll be able to see clearly that only having $30 left at the end of the month to put toward your credit card bill puts you at serious risk of being unable to get out of debt or lack the money you'll need to help put your kid through school. You might not be able to solve the problem immediately, but you could start taking steps in the right direction, whether it’s learning how to improve your credit score so you can refinance your debt at a lower interest rate or researching options for a less expensive education."
effective budgeting techniques for savings,investopedia,"Dynamic Scoring: Meaning, Pros and Cons, Example",Dynamic scoring is a measure of the impact that proposed tax budgets would have on the budget deficit and the overall economy over time.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dynamic-scoring.asp,"What Is Dynamic Scoring?

Dynamic scoring is a method of estimating the budgetary impact of a change in government policy. It is notable because it accounts for the secondary economic effects of a policy on all sources of government revenue and expenses, in addition to the direct effects of a policy on spending and revenue. In dynamic scoring, secondary effects are estimated using macroeconomic or econometric models.

Because these models can take many forms and include different assumptions, the results of dynamic scoring can be highly dependent on the specific model and assumptions used.

Dynamic scoring is contrasted from static scoring, which estimates only the direct impact that a policy change will have on government revenues and expenditures without otherwise assuming any change in the economy as a result of the policy. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Dynamic scoring is a method of estimating the total fiscal impact of a policy change, including its secondary economic effects.
It can provide a more complete picture of the impact of a policy change than static scoring, which is limited to the direct effects of a policy change on revenues and expenditures.
When government policies change, people tend to adjust their behavior in ways that can affect tax revenue or government expenditures in indirect ways. 
Dynamic scoring typically helps make the case for pro-growth policies because it takes into consideration the larger, positive impact of such policies on the economy.
Dynamic scoring is highly dependent on the type of model and assumptions used to estimate secondary economic effects, so it may not always be accurate.




Understanding Dynamic Scoring

When any government policy changes, people will tend to change their behavior in response. To a large extent, this is usually the point of the policy change in the first place. But we also know that changes in government policy can often come with unintended consequences and that changes in people’s behavior may involve more than just immediate and direct responses. 

Because fiscal concerns are a priority for policymakers, the direct and indirect effects of a policy change on government revenues and expenditures are typically of particular interest. To this end, when a new policy is proposed, estimating and projecting the fiscal impact of the new policy on the government’s budget is a major component of the debate around the policy change. The process of estimating the fiscal impact of policy change is known as “scoring.”

How Dynamic Scoring Is Done

Scoring is traditionally done through a method now referred to as static scoring. In static scoring, the direct fiscal impact of a policy is measured or estimated using a simple model.

For spending changes this is usually quite straightforward; the fiscal impact is the amount appropriated for the expenditure or an estimate based on simple assumptions around participation or demand on a particular program. For tax policy changes, estimating revenue generation is usually simple and noncontroversial.  

For example, if a proposal is put forth to place a $0.05 per gallon retail tax on milk and 50,000 gallons of milk are bought and sold annually in a jurisdiction, then static scoring estimates that tax revenue will increase by $0.05 x 50,000 = $2,500 per year. However, because such a tax will raise the total price that consumers pay for milk, and the law of demand tells us that people will tend to buy less at higher prices, the actual tax revenue will almost certainly be less than $2,500 per year. This is where dynamic scoring comes in. 

With dynamic scoring, economists can use economic models to predict how much demand for milk will fall due to the new tax. They can then estimate how much this decrease will affect annual tax revenue.

The government primarily uses static scoring but with some proposed legislation, dynamic scoring is also required.

Note that in theory, this technique should arrive at a more accurate estimate of the actual fiscal impact of a policy change. However, because dynamic scoring relies on economic theory and econometric modeling, the improved accuracy of any estimate produced will only be as good as the theory, assumptions, and model it depends on. While more accurate in theory, dynamic scoring can also introduce potential for error. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of Dynamic Scoring

Dynamic scoring has two primary advantages: It can improve the accuracy of budget scores, and it can remove bias against pro-growth policies.

When policies cause the economy to grow, they impact the budget because the government is now bringing in more revenue while spending less money on programs like unemployment. On the other hand, if the economy is slowing down, the government makes less revenue while spending more on social safety net programs.

Dynamic scoring assesses the impact of government policies beyond pure spending, making it possible to budget more accurately.

In comparison, static scoring ignores macroeconomic effects. This can cause the budgetary costs of pro-growth policies to appear higher than they actually are. Conversely, this can cause the costs of anti-growth policies to appear lower than they actually are. Dynamic scoring takes into consideration the true benefits and costs of pro-growth or anti-growth policies.

Some of the primary disadvantages of dynamic scoring are that it relies on theory-based models that are not always accurate; the fact that economists don't have a true way to measure the impact of policies in practice; and that macroeconomic models used in dynamic scoring tend to ignore certain aspects of public investment and the impact of income inequality.

Pros

Improves the accuracy of budget scores

Removes the bias against pro-growth policies

Cons

Relies on inaccurate theory-based models

Economists can't fully measure the impact of policies

Macroeconomic models ignore aspects of public investment

Macroeconomic models don't take into consideration income inequality

Dynamic Scoring vs. Static Scoring

Static scoring assumes that tax changes don't have any effect on the decisions of taxpayers. As a result, static scoring assumes that these tax changes have no impact on macroeconomic indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP), jobs, and investment.

Dynamic scoring, on the other hand, seeks to analyze the impact that policy changes have on the behavior of taxpayers, and how those behaviors impact macroeconomic factors. Static scoring is limited in scope and one-dimensional. Dynamic scoring is broader, encompassing a variety of areas that can be influenced by changes in policies.

Real-World Example

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017, was analyzed by the Joint Committee of Taxation (JCT) before being passed, and under static scoring, was expected to increase the budget by $1.5 trillion dollars. When dynamic scoring was used, taking into consideration macroeconomic factors, the TCJA was shown to increase the deficit by a smaller amount: $1.1 trillion.
1

The reason dynamic scoring showed a smaller increase in the deficit is because it showed that tax cuts would actually increase economic activity. It included the impact the act would have on disposable income, which would be increased, causing people to spend more, boosting the economy. The lower tax rates would also increase savings and investments.

What Is a Dynamic Tax Analysis?

A dynamic tax analysis seeks to assess the impact that tax policies would have on the behavior of taxpayers. It looks to understand the secondary effects of a policy rather than just the direct effects. It does so by analyzing how the policies change behavior and how those behaviors impact macroeconomic factors.

What Is a CBO Score?

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides a score, which is actually an estimate on the cost of certain proposed legislation. The score seeks to determine whether legislation will increase or decrease the deficit and what other benefits or costs may arise from passing or not passing the legislation.

What Is Budget Scoring?

Budget scoring is the impact that policies will have on the government's budget, such as government spending, revenues, and deficits. Scoring can be done in two ways: static (conventional) scoring or dynamic scoring.

The Bottom Line

Dynamic scoring is a method of calculating the economic impact of government policy. It aims to make a comprehensive estimate of fiscal impact by considering not just a policy's direct effects, but its secondary effects, as well. This includes changes how individuals and firms might respond to the policy in terms of demand, spending, and saving, for instance.

Dynamic scoring can provide policymakers with a detailed and comprehensive prediction of a policy's effects, but it's also based on econometric models which rely on assumptions, some possibly inaccurate. Dynamic scoring stands in contrast with static scoring, which is limited to estimating the direct fiscal impact of a policy."
effective budgeting techniques for savings,investopedia,"Value Engineering: Definition, Meaning, and How It Works",Value engineering is a systematic and organized approach to providing the necessary functions in a project at the lowest cost.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value-engineering.asp,"What Is Value Engineering?

Value engineering is a systematic, organized approach to providing necessary functions in a project at the lowest cost. Value engineering promotes the substitution of materials and methods with less expensive alternatives, without sacrificing functionality. It is focused solely on the functions of various components and materials, rather than their physical attributes. Value engineering is also called value analysis.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Value engineering is a systematic and organized approach to providing the necessary functions in a project at the lowest cost.
Value engineering promotes the substitution of materials and methods with less expensive alternatives, without sacrificing functionality.
Value engineering is often broken into six steps or phases starting with generating ideas and ending with change implementation.
Value engineering is primarily focused on the use, cost, esteem, and exchange values.
The ultimate formula for value is often defined as function divided by cost, with value engineering striving to maximize function while minimizing cost.
Understanding Value Engineering

Value engineering is the review of new or existing products during the design phase to reduce costs and increase functionality to increase the value of the product. The value of an item is defined as the most cost-effective way of producing an item without taking away from its purpose. Therefore, reducing costs at the expense of quality is simply a cost-cutting strategy.

The concept of value engineering evolved in the 1940s at General Electric, in the midst of World War II. Due to the war, purchase engineer Lawrence Miles and others sought substitutes for materials and components since there was a chronic shortage of them. These substitutes were often found to reduce costs and provided equal or better performance.
1

With value engineering, cost reduction should not affect the quality of the product being developed or analyzed.

Ratio of Function to Cost

Miles defined product value as the ratio of two elements: function to cost. The function of an item is the specific work it was designed to perform, and the cost refers to the cost of the item during its life cycle.
2
 The ratio of function to cost implies that the value of a product can be increased by either improving its function or decreasing its cost. In value engineering, the cost related to production, design, maintenance, and replacement are included in the analysis.

	
Product Value
=
Function
Cost
	​

Product Value=
Cost
Function
	​

	​


For example, consider a new tech product is being designed and is slated to have a life cycle of only two years. The product will thus be designed with the least expensive materials and resources that will serve up to the end of the product’s life cycle, saving the manufacturer and the end-consumer money. This is an example of improving value by reducing costs.

Another manufacturing company might decide to create added value by maximizing the function of a product with minimal cost. In this case, the function of every component of the item will be assessed to develop a detailed analysis of the purpose of the product. Part of the value analysis will require evaluating the multiple alternate ways that the project or product can accomplish its function.

Keep in mind that the steps below may slightly vary depending on the precise organization defining the steps. For example, it's common to see a step between ""Gather Information"" and ""Think Creatively"" for work done to review and analyze what needs improving, eliminating, or creating (usually defined as ""Function Analysis"".

Steps in Value Engineering

Value engineering often entails the following six steps, starting from the information-gathering stage and ending with change implementation.

Step 1: Gather Information

Value engineering begins by analyzing what a product lifecycle will look like. This includes a forecast of all the spending and processes related to manufacturing, selling, and distributing a product.

Value engineers will often break these considerations down into more manageable data sets. In addition to assigned financial values, value engineers may prioritize processes or elements along a product's manufacturing plan. Value engineering may also call for expectations regarding time, labor, or other resources for different manufacturing stages.

Step 2: Think Creatively

With the core baseline expectations for the product having been documented, it's now time for the value engineering team to consider new, different ways for the product to be developed. This includes trying new approaches, taking risks on things never been done before, or creatively applying existing processes in a new way.

Levering these creative ideas, value engineers will re-imagine how the product will be created and distributed from state to finish. This phase is the ""idea-generation"" stage where members of the team should be encouraged to brainstorm freely without fear of criticism.

Examples of thinking creatively may include changing the materials used, changing the product's design, removing redundant features, trading off reliability for flexibility, or changing the steps/order of the manufacturing process.

Step 3: Evaluate Ideas

With a bunch of ideas now on the table, it's time to decide which are reasonable and which aren't Each idea is often assessed for its advantages and disadvantages. Instead of focusing on the quantity of each tally, the value engineering team must consider which pros and cons outweigh their counterpart.

For example, a single change may result in five new benefits. However, doing so would outlaw distribution to a country that the company exports the most goods to. In this case, the five benefits may not outweigh the one disadvantage.

Step 4: Develop and Analyze

Once the ideas are ranked, the best ideas are taken and further analyzed. This includes drafting model plans, detailing changes and their impacts, producing revised financial projections, redesigning physical renderings, and assessing the overall viability of the change.

Be mindful of timeline constraints and considerations when analyzing changes, especially if other departments will be negatively impacted by pushed out schedules or deadline changes. Also, consider how the break-even point of a product may change as a result of the adjustment to ensure the strategy aligns with the philosophy and financial capability of the organization.

Step 5: Present Discoveries

With plans devised and presentations pulled together, it's time to deliver the best ideas to upper management or the board for their consideration. Often, more than one idea will be presented at a time so the deciding group can consider and compare alternatives. Each alternative should be consistently presented with fair representation across each choice.

Value engineering calls for enhancing the value of each product; therefore, presentations should begin and end with how the change will benefit the company. Presentations should also include revised timelines, financial projections, drawings, and risks. Often, management may seek specific answers on changes or desire to see different analysis performed than what is presented.

Step 6: Implement Changes

As management gives confirmation to move forward with changes, value management shifts from a theoretical practice to an change management implementation process. When proposed changes are accepted, new teams are formed and assigned areas of oversight. Value engineer team leads often remain engaged with the changes to monitor what is being adjusted and how expectations are being aligned with new realities.

If a company lacks the required expertise to brainstorm changes, it may rely on external third parties to manage the first five steps (with the company taking over once it has decided what changes to make).

Guiding Principles of Value Engineering

Regardless of the steps a company chooses to perform when value engineering, there are a handful of high-level, vague guiding principles of value engineering. These principles include:

Function-Oriented Approach: Value engineering starts with a focus on understanding the essential functions that a product or process must perform. This principle shifts the attention from the physical attributes of the product to its purpose.
Cost-Worth Analysis: As we looked at in the earlier section, there's a balance between functionality and price. This principle involves a detailed examination of the costs associated with each function of a product or process, comparing them to their value or worth, and removing functionality that does not meet cost-benefit thresholds.
Team Collaboration: Value engineering relies on a multidisciplinary team approach. It brings together professionals from various fields such as engineering, design, manufacturing, and finance. This diversity of expertise and perspectives is crucial for comprehensive problem-solving and identifying the key aspects worth keeping and aspects worth dropping. For instance, consider whether a marketing professional should calculate present value cashflows or whether a finance professional should redesign a social media communication strategy.
Client-Centric: The client-centric approach involves regular communication and feedback from the client throughout the process. Though the bullet above talks about internal teams working together, the company needs to also loop in clients for their feedback. By prioritizing the client's needs and requirements, value engineering ensures that the solutions provided are aligned with what the client values most (who are ultimately the ones that define what ""value"" is).
Documentation and Feedback: A related concept to being client-centric, value engineering demands thorough documentation. This involves keeping detailed records of methodologies, analyses, decisions, and outcomes. Documentation serves as a valuable resource for future projects, providing insights and lessons learned that can make future decision-making potentially more efficient and timely.
Types of Value

When performing value engineering, analysts must often consider how to define 'value'. After all, one customer's perception of a product may be very compared to another customer based on their assigned value of the good. In general, there are four primary types of value recognized by value engineering:

Use Value

Use value is the primary type of value and it is determined by the attributes of the good.
3
 These attributes define what the product is able to do, how it is used, and what its purpose is. This heavily ties to product differentiation where consumers can only derive value from a specific good without competitors.

The use value of a product is the primary purpose of value engineering. Without a use value, consumers would not initially purchase the good. For instance, if a type of shoe did not adequately protect someone's feet or make it so they could walk down the street, the shoe has little to no use value. Without use value, products will ultimately fail because they serve no purpose.

Cost Value

Assuming we have a good generating use value, it's now time to consider how it takes to make that good.
3
 Let's assume the shoes from above are tremendous for hiking, rugged wear, and waterproof protection. This means the shoes may require experienced labor to craft, specifically-treated raw materials for its production, and premium quality control for consumer safety.

In this example, all of the variables mentioned above represent different cost variables with different values. A consumer may value the shoes at $50/pair; if the company determines its cost value is $75/pair, the company must assess how to rebalance the equation. Alternatively, charging a customer prices too high will likely yield negative cost value.

Esteem Value

While the use value describes the physical benefit of a product, consumers may also experience intrinsic value that often extends beyond what the product is.
3
 For example, should the shoe above come from Nike, consumers may be willing to pay higher premium for the shoe because of the added esteem benefit of the brand recognition.

Though esteem value is often positive and associated with brand recognition, it can also be negative and correlated to brand dissonance. This is often related to the target consumer of the product. For example, low-cost, budget-conscious consumers may have negative esteem value when considering Apple's innovative, higher-cost product line.

Exchange Value

The last and smallest component of value relates to a product's ability to be exchanged.
3
 With the introduction of international shipping and supply chain analytics, it is now becoming easier for almost any consumer to receive any product in a reasonable amount of time.

Still, a value engineer must how to facilitate the distribution of a product, the physical characteristics of a product, and other attributions that make it so the good can easily be bought or traded. Should consumers find it very difficult to buy or receive the good, value may be lost or destroyed.


There are countless ways to define or categorize customer value. In reality, value engineering encompasses every value perceived or received by a customer whether it conforms to the four primary types above.

Value Engineering Tools

Different companies can choose what tools they want to use; not all tools listed below need to be used in every value engineering situation. However, these are the most common techniques companies leverage when performing value engineering:

Function Analysis System Technique (FAST): FAST is an approach where teams can visualize the relationships between different functions and identify the critical ones that contribute most to the overall value. This technique involves breaking down the product into basic functions and categorizing them as primary or secondary. Through this visual representation, teams can then explore alternative ways to perform these functions more efficiently and at a lower cost.
Brainstorming: General brainstorming encourages team members to think outside the box and propose innovative alternatives without immediate judgment or criticism. The goal is to produce as many ideas as possible, which can later be evaluated for feasibility and potential impact.
Benchmarking: Benchmarking involves comparing the project's functions, processes, and costs with those of similar projects or industry standards. This technique helps identify the best practices and performance standards so teams can set realistic performance targets and identify areas for improvement.
Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA): LCCA is a technique that evaluates the total cost of ownership of a product or system over its entire life span. This analysis includes initial costs, operation and maintenance costs, and disposal costs. By considering the long-term costs, LCCA helps in making decisions that may have higher upfront costs but result in lower total costs over time.
Value Stream Mapping (VSM): VSM is a visual tool used to map out all the steps in a process and identify areas where value is added and where waste occurs. Again, like LCCA, by visualizing the entire value stream, teams can identify non-value-added activities more easily.
Design of Experiments (DOE): DOE is a statistical approach used to plan, conduct, and analyze controlled tests to evaluate the factors that influence the performance of a product or process. Companies perform DOE to systematically investigate the effects of multiple variables and their interactions.
Pareto Analysis: Pareto analysis is used to identify the most significant factors contributing to a problem or cost. This technique involves categorizing and prioritizing issues or costs so that efforts can be focused on the areas with the greatest impact. By addressing the vital few factors that contribute most to costs or inefficiencies, teams can try and achieve significant improvements with relatively little effort.
Function-Cost Matrix: The function-cost matrix is a tool used to compare the costs associated with each function of a product or process. Like many others in this section of the article, this matrix helps in visualizing the relationship between functions and their costs, highlighting areas where cost savings can be achieved.
Value Engineering vs. Value Analysis

While value engineering is the technique often used before a product has been fabricated, value analysis is the technique used to analyze an existing product. The goal of value analysis is often to review an existing set of costs and benefits with the intention of enhancing its value.

While value engineering occurs earlier to prevent value loss, value analysis occurs after-the-fact and may be used to remediate product deficiencies. Value engineering is generally used to aid manufacturing, while value analysis may sometimes be used more heavily in the business or sales department.

Though the two terms may often be used interchangeably, value engineering is the practice of preventing unnecessary costs or deficient value while value analysis is the practice of eliminating costs or negative value components. Changes made in response to value analysis may be brought about during different stages of a product's life span, while value engineering only occurs at the initial product stage.

Limitations of Value Engineering

The value engineering process involves a detailed approach to analyzing functions. Teams must gather and assess extensive data, hold numerous meetings to brainstorm and evaluate alternatives, and meticulously document their findings and decisions. This substantial initial time investment pulls valuable resources without the guarantee that products or processes will be re-engineered with success.

Value engineering efforts can sometimes prioritize immediate cost reductions over long-term value. This short-term focus may lead to decisions that save money initially but result in higher costs or lower performance over the product's or system's lifecycle. For instance, choosing cheaper materials to reduce upfront costs might lead to increased maintenance or replacement costs in the future. Teams need to balance short-term implications with long-term value.

While reducing costs is a primary goal of value engineering, an excessive focus on cost-cutting can lead to unintended consequences as well. For example, eliminating certain features to save money might diminish the product's appeal or performance, ultimately negatively impacting the cost/benefit analysis. The same could somewhat be said about engineering. In some cases, value engineering can lead to over-engineering where the pursuit of optimization results in overly complex solutions. This complexity can ultimately increase costs and complicate implementation, even when trying to capture very little value.

Last, value engineering is not universally applicable to all projects. Some projects may have rigid specifications, regulatory requirements, or client preferences that limit the scope for applying value engineering principles. Projects in highly regulated industries such as pharmaceuticals or aerospace may have strict compliance requirements. Companies may also simply lack the internal resources or headcount with the necessary skill sets to perform the analysis needed to re-engineer products.

Example of Value Engineering

The initial design for the Golden Gate Bridge faced significant challenges, including spanning a 4,200-foot-wide strait with strong ocean currents and high winds. However, financial resources were limited due to the Great Depression, and initial cost estimates were prohibitively high.

Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss and his team led the value engineering process, striving to reduce costs without compromising safety or performance. Strauss and his team focused on essential functions such as providing a safe, durable, and efficient means of transportation across the strait. They substituted expensive materials with high-strength silicon steel, simplified the design by eliminating unnecessary elements, and employed innovative construction techniques. Pre-fabrication of components off-site further reduced labor costs and construction time.

Through these value engineering efforts, the final cost of the Golden Gate Bridge was significantly reduced to approximately $35 million from the original budget of $100 million. The bridge met all functional requirements (i.e. millions of travelers have successfully capitalized on the value of the bridge's transportation capability).

What Is the Role of Value Engineering?

Value engineering is the process of designing a product to ensure the value a customer receives is maximized. This is a careful activity of balancing the functions of the product along with the financial consideration of a product. In general, value engineering strives to maximize the benefit a consumer receives while minimizing costs.

What Are the Phases of Value Engineering?

Value engineering is often broken into six stages: information gathering, brainstorming, evaluating, developing plans, presentation, and implementation. The phases range from collecting relevant data to designing alternatives to see what management thinks of the potential changes. Keep in mind that some entities may tweak these steps (i.e. emphasize evaluating the functionality of processes while spending less time on the implementation steps).


Why Is Value Engineering Important?

Value engineering is the process to ensuring your customer's satisfaction and utility of a product is maximized. Without considering a product's use, cost, or functionality, a good may lose its place in the marketplace because it doesn't solve a problem or reflect accurate financial prices. Value engineering is important because it forces a company to evaluate its future plans to maximize profitability.

What Are the Types of Value in Value Engineering?

Value engineering often breaks values into the use, cost, exchange, and esteem value. Though other departments may use different categories to define consumer benefit, the end goal is to ensure all benefits of a consumer are captured for analysis.
3

The Bottom Line

Value engineering is the process of ensuring a product doesn't waste away its potential. Products that lack purpose or drive value will get lost in the marketplace, becoming cost centers for a company that yields little to no profit. By implementing value engineering, a company evaluates how a product can better serve its customers, how value can be created, and costs can be minimized."
impact of prioritizing savings over discretionary spending,investopedia,"Discretionary Expense Definition, Examples, and Budgeting",A discretionary expense is a cost that is not essential for the operation of a home or a business.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionary-expense.asp,"What Is a Discretionary Expense?

A discretionary expense is a non-essential expense. Discretionary expenses are costs without which businesses or households can survive. As such, they are defined as being wants rather than expenses that are needed. This means a business or household is still able to maintain itself even if all discretionary consumer spending stops. Meals at restaurants and entertainment costs are examples of discretionary expenses.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
A discretionary expense is a cost that is not essential for the operation of a home or a business.
Discretionary expenses for businesses are usually linked with improving a company’s reputation among its customers and employees.
Tracking discretionary expenses enables businesses and households to identify where they can save money in times of financial difficulties.
Discretionary expenses vary depending on the business or person.
Understanding Discretionary Expenses

Expenses are divided into several categories, namely non-discretionary and discretionary. While non-discretionary expenses are considered mandatory—housing, taxes, debt, and groceries—discretionary expenses are incurred above and beyond what is deemed necessary. These are generally considered wants, while non-discretionary expenses are usually referred to as needs. As such, discretionary expenses rarely have anything to do with a business or household's day-to-day operations. Rather, they cater to choice and lifestyle.1

Businesses and individuals pay for discretionary expenses with discretionary income—the amount of money left over after paying for housing, food, taxes, and other necessities. When times are good, people have more money to spend, and they normally do so on things they don't need, such as luxury items and other services—cars, vacations, restaurants, entertainment, electronics, etc.

When times get tough and short-term cash flow issues emerge, managers and individuals often try to weed out any unnecessary costs. Discretionary expenses are normally the first to go because stopping them is unlikely to have a major impact on a business or household.

Corporate discretionary expenses are usually linked to the promotion of a company’s market position. Buying the raw materials used to produce goods is usually considered essential. Spending money on employee training programs is not usually considered essential. Individuals may also find times when they need to consider cutting out certain expenses. For example, a person who runs into financial difficulties is more likely to prioritize paying utility bills over financing a vacation.

Understanding and identifying your non-discretionary and discretionary expenses—and which ones matter most to you—can help you save, set your goals, and plan for your financial future.

Special Considerations

What constitutes a discretionary expense is subjective. As such, it may differ considerably among individuals and businesses.

For example, a stable, well-established company could probably get away with slashing its advertising budget for a while if the need arises. A new company facing hardship, on the other hand, would probably need to make cutbacks elsewhere, being mindful that boosting exposure and getting its name out there is imperative to keeping the business afloat.

The same principle applies to individual consumers as well. Some people may only be able to afford a daily Starbucks run when things are going well. They may consider cutting out this expense when times are tough—or if they're saving up for a big expense, like a home or a car.


Types of Discretionary Expenses

As mentioned above, discretionary expenses are any costs that a consumer or business wants rather than needs. Some common discretionary items include:

Vacations and travel expenses
Automobiles
Alcohol and tobacco
Restaurants and other entertainment-related expenses
Coffee and specialty beverages
Hobby and sports-related expenses, such as crafting, sewing, and gym memberships2

It's important to point out again that what defines a discretionary expense depends on who's doing the buying. For instance, buying a new car may be considered a want for one person, but it may be considered essential for someone who has a long commute to work where driving is the only option.

How to Budget for Discretionary Expenses

It may be necessary for households and businesses to cut back on certain expenditures in response to decreases in income during tough economic times. That's why it's a good idea to track discretionary expenses separately from essential ones so that it is easy to see how costs can be reduced.

One helpful budgeting tactic is to rank discretionary expenses in order of importance from the least to most important. If a job loss or income reduction forces budget cuts, household members or a company's management team can easily identify the first discretionary expense to place on the chopping block.


Discretionary Expenses vs. Non-Discretionary Expenses

Expenses are divided into discretionary and non-discretionary costs. In other words, essential and non-essential expenses. Some expenses, such as vacation costs and luxury items, are not necessary to maintain a household and, thus, are classified as discretionary expenses. The income earner can pay for these goods or services at their discretion.

Certain expenses, though, must be paid to keep things running. These are called non-discretionary expenses. These are considered essential expenses, as the income earner must regularly pay them or suffer the consequences.1

Examples of non-discretionary spending include housing costs, taxes, and health insurance for individuals. Payroll, warehousing costs, and transport are non-discretionary expenses for businesses.

What Are Discretionary Funds?

Discretionary funds is a term used to describe the money an individual or business has left over to spend on non-essential goods and services. This money is left over after an individual, household, or organization pays for essential costs. For instance, governments may use discretionary funds for small-scale projects after taking care of all essential services.

What's the Difference Between Discretionary and Fixed Expenses?

Discretionary expenses are expenses paid for by individuals or businesses that aren't essential to their day-to-day lives or operations. These costs may not be predictable and can change over time. Fixed expenses, on the other hand, are costs that are incurred regularly. These are predictable, which means households and businesses can count on them being the same (or roughly the same) each period. Examples of fixed costs are housing and rent, insurance, and utilities.

What Does Discretionary Income Mean?

The term discretionary income refers to the total income left after a household or business pays for necessities, including taxes, housing, groceries, and utilities. This type of income is used to maintain a certain standard of living or operations. As such, discretionary income can be used to pay for things like vacations, luxury items, and savings.


The Bottom Line

Costs are divided into several categories. Some are essential while others are not. The first, which includes essential and mandatory items, are called non-discretionary expenses. This is contrasted to discretionary expenses. These costs are deemed non-essential, such as vacations, luxury goods, and nights out. Discretionary spending happens when all non-discretionary costs are covered. Keep in mind that these are needs and can be sacrificed when times get tough.

Individuals ranging in age from 35 to 44 or older often fall into a category referred to as the sandwich generation because they find themselves taking care of their children and parents at the same time. While there is no cookie-cutter retirement planning solution, the following tips may be helpful to those who find themselves in this situation and are struggling to save for retirement.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Those aged 35 to 44 and older often struggle to save for retirement while juggling financial responsibility for children and aging parents.
Funding a child’s college education should not come at the expense of your retirement goals.
Consider long-term care (LTC) insurance for aging parents.
Formalize financial boundaries for boomerang kids.
It’s also crucial to set a realistic budget, which should include an emergency fund.
Finally, it never hurts to ask for a raise, particularly if you’ve worked for the same company for a while and have a good track record.
Saving for Retirement vs. Paying for College

Most parents want their children to graduate from college debt-free so they can start their career with a clean financial slate. While some may be able to pay for their children's education and still save for retirement, most cannot. The question then becomes, which is the better financial choice?

When pondering such a decision, the options available for financing a college education should be weighed carefully. For instance, consider the following.

Saving for Retirement

With the shift from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans and the fact that Social Security has never provided enough for a comfortable retirement, individuals are largely responsible for financing their retirement years. As such, they must save as much as possible to increase the possibility of experiencing a financially secure retirement, and to make working during retirement optional rather than mandatory.

Paying for College

Options for financing college include grants for those who are eligible, scholarships for those who qualify, and loans. While loans do mean college students will likely have outstanding debt after graduation, they will have several options and many years to pay them off.

Children who are opposed to college loans may consider a work-school program, where they work full-time and attend college on a part-time basis. While this could extend the amount of time it takes the child to receive a degree or diploma, the trade-off is being debt-free after graduation. Many employers will even reimburse college students for some or all of the tuition expenses, provided they receive a passing grade for the course.

""Some families want their children to have some skin in the game and will pay for some college themselves,"" says Derek Hagen, CFP®, CFA, financial planner and founder of Money Health Solutions. ""For those families, contributing more to retirement than college would probably work best. For those who don't want their child to have to pay anything, they'll probably pay more toward college until college is done, and then ramp up their retirement savings.""

Financing is available to pay for college, but not for retirement.

Remember that college graduates move on to an income-generating career, while retirees rely on retirement savings rather than a job for income.

""Most families prioritize college savings over retirement because it's the closest large expenditure,"" says Rob Schulz, CFP®, president of Schulz Wealth, Mansfield, Texas. ""What they don't realize is that retirement savings needed are usually massive, well over 10 times, if not 20 or 30 times, the savings required for college. Certainly, save for college, but not at the expense of your retirement goals.""

Set Financial Boundaries for Boomerang Kids

While most children leave home to live on their own by their mid-to-late 20s or thereabouts, many do not. Some who do leave also end up returning home for various reasons.

These individuals are commonly referred to as boomerang kids. Unfortunately, some boomerangers fall back into the pattern of having their parents pay for their living expenses, which can have a negative impact on the ability to save for retirement.

Parents who find themselves living with boomerangers may want to consider formalizing the financial aspects of the relationship. Examples include having the child sign an agreement to pay a certain amount for rent, food, and utilities each month. Parents may also want to make it clear that, like tenants, they will be evicted if they do not pay their fair share of the expenses. 

Consider Long-Term Care Insurance for Aging Parents

The cost of caring for aging parents usually increases as they get older, and most of the expense is due to healthcare. Further, adult children who are unable to pay the cost for elder care often find it necessary to take care of their parents themselves. Similar to the situation with boomerangers, this can put quite a strain on the caretakers' finances and could prevent them from saving for their retirement.

One way of ensuring that the cost of healthcare for aging parents is covered is to purchase long-term care (LTC) insurance. LTC insurance can be used to cover various expenses, including in-home healthcare or healthcare at nursing homes. It not only serves to ease the financial burden on the children but can also negate the need for aging parents to tap into their retirement savings to pay for healthcare.

If your parents can't afford the cost, helping them pay for it could be worth it in the long run.

Create a Realistic Budget

As an individual gets closer to middle age, panic can set in if an assessment of retirement savings indicates that the program is not on target. The natural reaction is usually to increase the amount being saved in order to get closer to the target saving amount.

Our surprising advice: Don't rush into it without some analysis first. Saving more than an affordable amount can have a negative impact. When deciding whether to increase what you save in your retirement accounts, first consider the following questions.

Why Is the Savings Goal Not on Target?

If it is because the budgeted amount is not being saved on a regular basis, and is that a result of the amounts being redirected toward unnecessary expenses? If so, an easy fix would be to stick to the budget and eliminate these unnecessary expenses. If the amount is being redirected toward things that the family needs, perhaps the retirement savings goal and the budget are not realistic and need to be revised.

Is Increasing Retirement Savings a Realistic Objective?

It may seem like a good idea to add larger amounts to your retirement nest egg. However, if it means that the reduction in disposable income will either result in increasing credit card and other debts incurred for everyday expenses, increasing retirement savings could actually have a negative effect on your bottom line.

Were Withdrawals From Retirement Accounts Used for Emergencies?

If you find yourself needing to withdraw amounts from your retirement account to cover emergencies, it could mean that your emergency fund is insufficient. Financial experts advise that an emergency fund account should have at least three months' worth of net income to cover unplanned expenses. Similar to retirement savings, treat amounts added to the emergency fund as a recurring expense so you aren't faced with an unanticipated financial burden when a crisis hits.

Realistic budgeting is key to a solid savings program. The budget must not only allow for retirement savings and everyday living expenses but should factor in allocations to an emergency fund.

""One of the golden rules of budgeting in savings is to pay yourself first,"" says Kirk Chisholm, wealth manager at Innovative Advisory Group in Lexington, Mass. ""Set up an automated savings plan where a monthly amount goes into your savings account that you do not touch. If you pay yourself first, then you tend to adjust to a lower amount of discretionary spending. If you save what is left at the end of the month, you will likely not have anything left to save.""

Martin A. Federici Jr., AAMS®, CEO of MF Advisers Inc., Dallas, Pa, suggests the following:

No matter your age, income, tax bracket, debt load, etc., having a budget forces you to pay attention to your cash flow—which helps avoid problems like bouncing checks, running out of money every month to pay bills, not saving enough for retirement, and more. If you can’t deal realistically with your inflow/outflow situation, you’re not going to do well planning your financial future (and retirement) by just winging it.
Ask for a Raise

If you have been with your employer for a while and have established that you are a valuable asset to the firm, it may be time to ask for a raise. Before doing so, be sure to document your contributions to the organization and the ways in which you add value. Also, consider whether the amount you intend to ask for is comparable to the results you have produced for your company.

Quite a few services provide information on the average salary for certain job types and locations. A copy of such an analysis would go a long way in helping to make your case. Most employers will give fair consideration to a reasonable request for a salary increase.

The Bottom Line

Saving for retirement can be a challenge, particularly when juggling the financial responsibility of children and aging parents. One way to overcome that challenge is to treat savings as a recurring expense. In most cases, this is easier to accomplish when there is an increase in disposable income, such as from a salary increase or change in family status, which results in fewer expenses.

For others, it may mean cutting back on non-essential spending. Of course, mental health is just as important as financial health. Budgeting should not mean depriving yourself of a treat every now and then."

While inflation may be painful for your wallet, it’s a relatively normal part of the economic cycle. In fact, experts like to see at least some inflation every year as evidence the economy is growing. It can be helpful to look at how inflation has changed throughout the past 25 years and how today’s inflation rates fit into the broader context.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Inflation is the increase in the cost of goods and services, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using the Consumer Price Index.
Inflation is generally the result of either supply-side or demand-side factors, but can also be caused by inflation expectations.
Inflation has ebbed and flowed over the past 25 years, reaching its highest point in 2022 and its lowest point in 2009.
The latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the current inflation rate is 3%, down from this time last year, the lowest rate since March 2021.
2
Though it’s impossible to forecast inflation with absolute certainty, experts generally predict inflation will continue to ease.
Understanding Inflation

Inflation refers to the rise in the price of goods and services over time. In other words, when the latte you were once able to buy for $5 now costs $6, inflation is the culprit.

It’s measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average change of a consumer goods and services basket. It determines the overall average inflation rate and price changes for individual spending categories, such as groceries, health care, and more.

“Most often, inflation is measured yearly, answering the question: relative to the same period last year, how much has the price of the basket of goods and services changed?” said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, a senior economist with FHN Financial.

The Federal Reserve is responsible for managing inflation and targets an average annual inflation rate of around 2%.
5
 To achieve this, it employs monetary policy, such as adjusting interest rates, which has been used in recent years.

“Interest rate policy—setting the federal funds target rate—is the Federal Reserve’s preferred monetary policy tool,” said Kearney-Lederman. “When inflation is too high or rising too quickly, the Federal Reserve can increase the fed funds target, which makes borrowing more expensive, which in turn slows demand for goods and services, pulling demand down to better align with supply.”

On the other hand, if the economy is growing too slowly, the Fed might lower rates to encourage consumer spending.
6

What Factors Influence Inflation?

Inflation can usually be divided into two key categories based on its cause: demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation.

Demand-pull inflation occurs when the demand for products and services exceeds the supply.
7
 For example, if 100 people are shopping for homes but only 50 homes are available, the price of those homes will naturally rise. Ryan Jacobs of Jacobs Investment Management states this is “often due to increased consumer spending, government expenditure, or investment.

Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, results from an increase in the cost of production or disruptions to the supply chain.
7
 For example, after 2020, a labor shortage led to increased wages, while simultaneously, a disrupted supply chain pushed production costs up.
8

“Inflation expectations also play a crucial role. If people expect prices to rise, they may spend more now, which can drive prices up further,” said Jacobs.
7

Historical Overview of Inflation Rates (1999-Today)

Economists and news sources often cite price inflation as an average rate over a specific period. But when you zoom out and look at the big picture, you can see how inflation has ebbed and flowed over the years.

“The early 2000s experienced moderate inflation, but the financial crisis of 2007-2008 led to deflationary pressures, prompting central banks to adopt aggressive monetary policies,” said Jacobs. “The 2010s generally saw low inflation rates, but the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have caused significant inflationary spikes in recent years.”

For example, the United States experienced negative inflation—known as deflation—during 2009. It was the lowest inflation rate in the past two decades. On the other hand, the highest inflation happened throughout late 2021 and 2022.
9

The highest historical inflation rate in the United States occurred in November 1918, when the price of goods and services increased by 20.7%.
10
 The country has never experienced hyperinflation, when inflation rises more than 50% per month.
11

Inflation also doesn’t occur evenly across all spending categories. Let’s break down a few common spending categories to see how their price increases compare to the overall average inflation rate.

Housing Costs

The cost of housing has increased significantly higher than goods and services overall. The cumulative rate of inflation from 1999 to 2023 was about 83%. Meanwhile, housing prices increased by nearly 166% in the same period.
12
13

College Tuition

Like housing, the price of higher education has also grown considerably more than the overall inflation rate over the past 25 years. The cumulative inflation rate between 1998 and 2023 for all undergraduate institutions, public and private, four-year and two-year, was 175%. The impact was most significant for public universities, which saw price hikes of 187% compared to the 155% increase in private schools.
14

Gas

The price of gas gets a lot of attention in the news, but it’s not reflective of average inflation. The price of gas tends to be far more erratic than inflation overall. Over the past two decades, it has had periods of extreme inflation, while also going through periods of extreme deflation, including periods when overall inflation is rising. Gas price inflation has increased an average of 6.96% per year over the past 25 years (January 1999 through July 2024, the latest data available as of publication), while the average overall inflation rate was just 2.54% per year for the same period.
10
15

TV

Consumer electronic goods such as televisions have trended opposite to most goods and services. For example, a TV that cost $500 in 1999 would cost closer to $10 in 2024. TV prices have experienced negative inflation of an average of 14.52% per year since 1999.
16
 Of course, the TVs we purchase today are far more expensive than that, but they haven’t risen with inflation, even when you account for the major technological advancements.

Minimum Wage

The minimum wage is one part of the economy where inflation has been notably absent. It sat at $5.15 from 1997 to 2007, when it increased to $5.85. It increased again to $6.55 in 2008 and $7.25 in 2009, which has remained since.
17
 For the minimum wage to have kept pace with inflation since 1999, it would need to be $9.86 today.

Vehicles

If you tried to buy a car during the pandemic, you probably noticed how dramatically vehicle prices increased. For example, used vehicle prices in February 2022 were about 41% higher than just one year earlier.
19
 New vehicle prices rose more than 12% in that same period.
20
 However, vehicle prices don’t usually rise so much year-to-year. They’ve actually decreased at several points throughout the past 20 years, including throughout early 2024.
9

Food

On average, annual inflation of food prices is about 2.8% since 1999. However, food away from home, such as restaurants, has increased in price more than groceries.
21

Plane Tickets

You might be surprised to learn that airline fares have risen slower than the prices of other goods and services. The average annual inflation rate for plane tickets has been just 1.3% since 1999.
22

Health Care

Consumer health-care costs have risen slightly more than the average inflation rate. While inflation over the past 25 years has been around 2.54% per year, health-care costs have risen by about 3.32%.
23
 What makes health-care spending unique, of course, is the uncertainty. You could spend almost nothing in one year and thousands the next year.

Clothing

The cost of clothing has risen surprisingly slowly compared to other goods and services. According to BLS data for the past 25 years, the average annual inflation rate for clothing was -0.03%.
24
 Unlike many goods and services, clothing has experienced several deflationary periods over the past two decades, meaning prices have fallen, at least temporarily.
9

Inflation Forecasting and Future Trends

It’s impossible to pinpoint future inflation accurately. Certainly, no one in 2019 knew we’d soon experience a global pandemic leading to extreme inflation. However, economists and other financial experts can still use some tools, including statistical models and economic indicators, to predict future trends.

According to Kearney-Lederman, forecasts predict inflation will continue to fall from its recent high levels.

“Consumer inflation peaked this cycle in the middle of 2022 and has since been slowing,” said Kearney-Lederman. “It is still running above the Fed’s 2% target, however recent progress in both the CPI and the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) indices in May and June have put inflation back on track to continue to move down toward the Fed’s 2% target.

Coping With Inflation: Tips and Strategies

Inflation places pressure on household budgets, but there are steps you can take to cope with it. According to Jacobs, the best thing you can do is get a handle on your spending.

“Prioritizing essential purchases and cutting back on discretionary spending can help manage higher costs,” said Jacobs.

A hefty emergency fund can be invaluable during times of inflation. Not only can you dip into it if your costs exceed your income, but it’s also there for financial emergencies such as job loss, medical bills, or anything else that pops up.

If you’re saving and investing your extra money, look for those investments whose returns outpace inflation. The stock market has historically risen at a rate higher than inflation. Even a high-yield savings account can be a hedge against inflation. 

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How Does Inflation Affect Different Income Groups?

Inflation impacts low-income Americans more for a couple of different reasons. First, while high earners have seen their incomes keep pace with or exceed inflation, lower-earning Americans have seen theirs rise slower than inflation (or even fall). Additionally, low-income families spend more of their household income on goods and services than high-income families. As a result, an increase in groceries or gasoline is more impactful.
26

What Role Do Government Policies Play in Controlling Inflation?

The Federal Reserve is tasked with controlling inflation using monetary policy, primarily by raising and lowering interest rates. The legislature can also control inflation through fiscal policy, which includes taxes and spending initiatives.
27

Are There Any Sectors That Benefit From Inflation?

Inflation isn’t an inherently bad thing—the economy as a whole benefits from some level of inflation. Additionally, some individual sectors can benefit from above-average inflation. Most notably, individual consumers benefit when the price of labor—in other words, wages—increases, as well as the cost of their investments.

How Do Global Events Influence Inflation Rates?

Global events can influence inflation by creating cost-push inflation, where global events, including natural disasters, push up production costs or disrupt the global supply chain. This was one reason for the inflation that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How Much Has Inflation Gone Up in the Last 25 Years?

Cumulatively, inflation has increased 89% in the last 25 years, with an average annual increase of 2.54% per year. During that period, it reached as high as 9.1% in June 2022 and as low as -2.1% in July 2009.
10

The Bottom Line

Inflation has been at the top of Americans' minds for the past several years, and there’s no doubt it can be painful for household budgets. However, a greater understanding of how inflation works and historical inflation rates can help you prepare not only for how it impacts your budget today but also for how it will affect your long-term financial planning.

actionable steps for creating a personal budget,investopedia,7 Steps To Create a 10-Years-From-Retirement Plan,Workers who are only 10 years away from retiring need to do a number of things to ensure that they achieve a comfortable retirement.,https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-analysis/090216/7-steps-create-10-year-retirement-plan.asp,"Creating a comfortable retirement is probably the single biggest financial challenge anyone can face. Unfortunately, it’s a challenge for which many working people are ill-prepared.

A 2023 GOBankingRates study found that 53% of workers surveyed had less than $10,000 saved toward retirement.1 In 2024, 28% had nothing saved and 39% weren’t contributing to a retirement fund.2 Some of the folks in that group may have a pension to rely on, but most are financially unprepared to exit the workforce.

Social Security is only designed to replace a portion of income in retirement, so those who find themselves roughly 10 years away from retiring, regardless of how much money they have saved, need to develop a plan for hitting the finish line successfully.3

KEY TAKEAWAYS
It’s possible to increase your savings significantly if you still have 10 years until you retire.
Take the time to assess where you are—how much you have saved and your sources of income, your retirement goals, your budget for retirement, and the age at which you want to stop working.
If there’s a gap between your savings and what you need, take steps to save more—increase 401(k) and IRA contributions, set up automatic payroll deductions to savings accounts—and spend less.
It may be useful to hire a financial planner to help you stay on track and suggest additional ways to grow your retirement savings.
Get Started on a 10-Year Plan

Ten years is still enough time to reach a solid financial position. “It’s never too late! During the next 10 years, you may be able to accumulate a small fortune with proper planning,” says Patrick Traverse, CFP, financial advisor, at MoneyCoach, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

People who have not saved a lot of money need to make an honest assessment of where they are and what sacrifices they are willing to make. Taking a few necessary steps now can make a world of difference down the road.

1. Assess Your Current Situation

Nobody likes to admit they might be ill-prepared to retire, but an honest assessment of where you are now financially is vital in order to create a plan that can accurately address any shortfalls.

Begin by counting how much you have accumulated in accounts earmarked for retirement. This includes balances in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and workplace retirement plans, such as a 401(k) or 403(b). Include taxable accounts if you’re going to use them specifically for retirement, but omit money saved up for emergencies or larger purchases, such as a new car.

53%

The number of Americans who have less than $10,000 saved for retirement as of 2023.

2. Identify Sources of Income

Existing retirement savings should provide the lion’s share of monthly income in retirement, but it may not be the only source. Additional income can come from a number of places outside of savings, and you should also consider that money.

Most workers qualify for Social Security benefits depending on factors such as career earnings, length of work history, and the age at which benefits are taken.4 For workers with no current retirement savings, this may be their only retirement asset. The government’s Social Security website provides a retirement benefit estimator to help determine what kind of monthly income you can expect in retirement.

If you’re fortunate enough to be covered by a pension plan, monthly income from that asset should be added. You can also tally up income from a part-time job while in retirement.

3. Consider Your Retirement Goals

This proves to be a significant factor in retirement planning. Someone intent on downsizing to a smaller property and living a quiet, modest lifestyle in retirement will have very different financial needs than a retiree who wants to travel extensively.

You should develop a monthly budget to estimate regular expenditures in retirement, such as housing, food, dining out, and leisure activities. The costs for health and medical expenses—such as life insurance, long-term care insurance, prescription drugs, and doctor’s visits—can be substantial later in life, so be sure to factor them into a budget estimate.

4. Set a Target Retirement Age

Someone who is 10 years away from retirement could be as young as 45 if they are well prepared financially and eager to exit the workforce, or as old as 65 or 70 if not. People with longer life expectancies should do their retirement planning estimates assuming they’ll need to fund a retirement that could potentially last for three decades or even more.

Planning for retirement means evaluating not only your expected spending habits in retirement but also how many years retirement may last. A retirement that lasts 30 to 40 years looks very different from one that may only last half that time. While early retirement may be a goal of many workers, a reasonable target retirement date achieves a balance between the size of the retirement portfolio and the length of retirement the nest egg can adequately support.

“The best way to determine a target date to retire is to consider when you will have enough to live through retirement without running out of money,” says Kirk Chisholm, wealth manager and principal at Innovative Advisory Group in Lexington, Massachusetts. “And it is always best to make conservative assumptions in case your estimates are a bit off.”

Eliminating debt, especially high-interest debt such as credit cards, is crucial to getting your finances under control.

5. Confront Any Shortfall

All of the numbers compiled to this point should help answer the most important question of all: Do the accumulated retirement assets exceed the anticipated amount needed to fully fund your retirement? If the answer is yes, then it’s important to keep funding your retirement accounts in order to maintain the pace and stay on track. If the answer is no, then it’s time to figure out how to close the gap.

With 10 years to go until retirement, those who are behind schedule need to figure out ways to add to their savings accounts. To make meaningful changes, a combination of increasing your savings rate and cutting back on unnecessary spending is likely necessary. It’s important to figure out how much more you need to save to close the shortfall and make appropriate changes to how much you contribute to IRAs and 401(k) accounts. Automatic savings options through payroll or bank account deductions are often ideal for keeping your savings on track.

You should also get cracking on eliminating your debt. Americans’ credit card debt reached $1.7 trillion in 2023, and the average balance on credit cards was $6,501, according to Experian data.5 With much of that debt attached to high interest rates, getting rid of it can make a dramatic difference in your monthly budget.

“In reality, there are no financial magic tricks a financial advisor can do to make your situation better,” says Mark T. Hebner, founder and president of Index Fund Advisors, Inc., Irvine, California, and author of “Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors.”6 “It is going to take hard work and becoming accustomed to living on less in retirement. It doesn’t mean that it cannot be done, but having a transition plan and someone there for accountability and support is crucial.”

High-risk investments make more sense earlier in life and are generally ill-advised during retirement.

6. Assess Your Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance is different at different ages. As workers begin approaching retirement age, portfolio allocations should gradually turn more conservative in order to preserve accumulated savings. A bear market with only a handful of years remaining until retirement could cripple your plans to exit the workforce on time. Retirement portfolios at this stage should focus primarily on high-quality, dividend-paying stocks and investment-grade bonds to produce both conservative growth and income.

One guideline suggests that investors should subtract their age from 110 to determine how much to invest in stocks. A 70-year-old, for example, would target an allocation of 40% stocks and 60% bonds.7

If you’re behind on your savings, it may be tempting to ramp up your portfolio risk in order to try to produce above-average returns. While this strategy may be successful on occasion, it often delivers mixed results. Investors taking a high-risk strategy can sometimes find themselves making the situation worse by committing to riskier assets at the wrong time.

Some additional risk may be appropriate depending on your preferences and tolerance, but taking on too much risk can be dangerous. Increasing equity allocations by 10% may be appropriate in this scenario for the risk-tolerant.

7. Consult a Financial Advisor

Money management is an area of expertise for relatively few individuals. Consulting a financial advisor or planner may be a wise course of action for those who want a professional overseeing their personal situation. A good planner ensures that a retirement portfolio maintains a risk-appropriate asset allocation and, in some cases, can provide advice on broader estate planning issues as well.

Planners, on average, charge roughly 1% of total assets managed annually for their services. It’s generally advisable to choose a planner who gets paid based on the size of the portfolio managed rather than someone who earns commissions based on the products they sell.8

The Bottom Line

If you have little saved for retirement, you need to think of this as a wake-up call to get serious about turning things around.

“If you are 55 and ‘short on savings,’ you’d better take drastic action to catch up while you are still employed and generating earnings,” says John Frye, CFA, chief investment officer, Crane Asset Management, LLC, Beverly Hills, Calif. “It’s said that people’s 50s (and early 60s) are their ‘earning years,’ when they have fewer expenses—the kids are gone, the house is either paid off or was bought at a low price years ago—and so they can put away more of their take-home pay. So get busy.”

Better to tighten your belt now than be forced to do it when you are in your 80s."

Creating a retirement plan begins with determining your long-term financial goals and tolerance for risk, and then starting to take action to reach those goals. The process can begin any time during your working years, but the earlier the better.

The process of creating a retirement plan includes identifying your income sources, adding up your expenses, putting a savings plan into effect, and managing your assets. By estimating your future cash flows, you can judge whether your retirement income goal is realistic.

Needless to say, a retirement plan is not a static document. You'll need to update it from time to time as well as review it to monitor your progress.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
It is never too early or too late to start a retirement plan.
A retirement plan is a strategy for long-term saving, investing, and finally withdrawing money you accumulate to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.
A key part of a retirement plan is taking advantage of one of the government-approved investment vehicles, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k) account, which offer tax advantages to retirement savers.
Your retirement plan needs to take into account your estimated future expenses, liabilities, and life expectancy.
What Is a Retirement Plan?

A retirement plan may be seen as a roadmap to a comfortable life after work. It entails accumulating enough money to pay for the lifestyle you want to enjoy in the future. Your retirement plan may well change over time, but the earlier you get started the better.

8 Essential Tips For Retirement Saving
How Retirement Planning Works

A retirement plan is your preparation for a good life after you're done working to pay the bills, or at least done working a full-time job. But it's not all about money.

The non-financial aspects include lifestyle choices such as how you want to spend your time in retirement and where you'll live. A holistic approach to retirement planning considers all these areas.

The goals for your retirement plan will change in focus over time:

Early in a person’s working life, your contribution to retirement savings may be modest. The reward is 40-plus years of investment growth.
During the middle of your career, when your income may be at its peak, you might set specific income or asset targets and take steps toward achieving them.
Once you reach retirement age, you go from accumulating assets to what planners call the distribution phase. You’re no longer paying into your retirement account(s). Instead, you start collecting the rewards of decades of savings.

Some retirement plans change depending on where you are. The United States and Canada each have unique systems of workplace-sponsored plans.1

How Much Do You Need to Retire?

Your magic number, which is the amount you need to retire comfortably, is highly personalized. But there are rules of thumb that can give you an idea of how much to save.

People used to say that you need around $1 million to retire comfortably.
Other professionals use the 80% rule, which states that you need 80% of your current income to live comfortably after retiring. So if you made $100,000 per year, you would need savings that produce $80,000 per year for roughly 20 years, or a total of $1.6 million.
Others say most of us aren’t saving anywhere near enough to meet those benchmarks and should adjust our lifestyles accordingly.
Estimating Expenses

Your post-retirement expenses largely determine that ""magic number.""

It's a good idea to create a retirement budget, calculating estimated costs for housing, health insurance, food, clothing, and transportation.

And since you'll have more free time on your hands, you may also want to factor in the cost of entertainment, hobbies, and travel.

It may be hard to come up with concrete figures, but a reasonable estimate will be helpful.

Steps to Retirement Planning

Regardless of where you are in life, there are several key steps that apply to almost everyone during their retirement planning. The following are some of the most common:

Come up with a plan. This includes deciding when you want to start saving when you want to retire, and how much you'd like to save for your ultimate goal.
Decide how much you'll set aside each month. Using automatic deductions takes away the guesswork, keeps you on track, and takes away the temptation to stop or forget depositing money on your own.
Choose the right accounts for you. Invest in a 401(k) or similar account if your employer offers that option. If the company offers an employer match and you don't sign up, you're giving away free money. Whether or not there's an employer match, you're getting a good deal tax-wise.
Check on your investments from time to time and make adjustments. This is especially important after a big event, like marriage or a baby.

Retirement Plans

Tax-advantaged retirement savings plans have become the keystone of long-term savings for Americans. You should have access to one or more of these plans depending on how you earn a living. Each has its own rules and regulations.

Employer-Sponspored Plans

Most large companies offer their employees 401(k) plans. Nonprofit employers have similar 403(b) plans.

An up-front benefit of these qualified retirement plans is that your employer has the option to match what you invest up to a certain amount. For example, if you contribute 3% of your annual income to your plan account, your employer may match that amount, depositing the sum into your retirement account along with your contribution.

You can contribute more than the amount that will earn the employer match. Some experts recommend contributing upwards of 10%.

401(k) Limits

The maximum is revised yearly by the IRS Participants can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024 to a 401(k) or 403(b), some of which may be added to with an employer match. People over age 50 can contribute an extra $7,500 per year as a catch-up contribution in 2024.2

These accounts can earn a much higher rate of return than a savings account (although the investments are not free of risk). The funds in the account, if it is a traditional account rather than a Roth account, are not taxed until you withdraw them. Since your contributions are taken off your gross income, you will get an immediate income tax break.

Those who are on the cusp of a higher tax bracket might consider contributing enough to lower their tax liability.3

Traditional Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

The traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is similar to a 401(k) plan but it can be obtained at virtually any bank or brokerage. It is primarily for self-employed people and others who have no access to a 401(k), but anyone with earned income can invest in an IRA.

The money you save in an IRA is deducted from your income for the year, lowering your taxable income and, therefore, your tax liability.

The tax benefit to this kind of account is upfront. So when it comes time to take distributions from the account, you are subject to your standard tax rate at that time. Keep in mind, though, that the money grows on a tax-deferred basis. There are no capital gains or dividend taxes that are assessed on the balance of your account until you begin making withdrawals.4

IRA Limits

The IRS sets limits on how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA each year. The limit for 2024 is $7,000. People who are 50 and older can invest an additional $1,000 for a total of $8,000 in 2024.2

Distributions must be taken at age 72 and can be taken as early as 59½. You will owe taxes on the withdrawal at your regular income tax rate for that year.5

Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA)

A Roth IRA is funded with post-tax dollars. This is a great variation on the IRA, with a little more pain upfront for a lot of gain down the road.

The Roth IRA eliminates the immediate tax deduction of the traditional IRA. The money you pay into it is taxed in that year.

However, you should owe no taxes when you start withdrawing money, either on the amount you put in or the investment gains it accrued.

Starting a Roth IRA early can pay off big time in the long run, even if you don’t have a lot of money to invest at first. Remember, the longer the money sits in a retirement account, the more tax-free interest is earned.

Roth Limits

The 2024 contribution limit for either IRA (Roth or traditional) is $7,000 a year, or $8,000 if you are over age 50. A Roth has other restrictions, related to income. For instance:

A single filer can contribute the full amount only if they make $146,000 or less annually, as of the 2024 tax year.
After that, you can invest to a lesser degree, up to an annual income of $161,000 in 2024.

Note that the income limits are higher for married couples filing jointly.2

As with a 401(k), a Roth IRA has some penalties associated with taking money out before you hit retirement age. But there are a few notable exceptions that may be useful in an emergency. First, you can always withdraw the money you invested (but not the gains it earned) without paying a penalty.6


SIMPLE Individual Retirement Account (IRA)

The SIMPLE IRA is a retirement account available to employees of small businesses. It's an alternative to the 401(k), which is expensive for an employer to manage. It works the same way a 401(k) does, allowing employees to save money automatically through payroll deductions with the option of an employer match.

This amount is capped at 3% of an employee's annual salary. The annual contribution limit for a SIMPLE IRA is $16,000 in 2024. Catch-up contributions of $3,500 allow employees 50 or older to bump that limit up to $19,500 in 2024.2

Once you set up a retirement account, the question becomes where to invest the money. You will be offered a choice, usually among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many also offer target-date funds, which automatically alter your selections over time, allocating more money towards conservative choices as you approach retirement age.


Stages of Retirement Planning

Below are some guidelines for successful retirement planning at different stages of your life.

Young Adulthood (Ages 21–35)

Those embarking on adult life may not have a lot of money free to invest, but they do have time to let investments mature, which is a critical piece of retirement savings. This is the principle of compounding.

Compound interest allows interest to earn interest, and the more time you have, the more interest you will earn. If you can only put aside $50 a month, it will be worth three times more if you invest it at age 25 than if you wait to start investing until age 45, thanks to the joys of compounding.

You might be able to invest more money in the future, but you’ll never be able to make up for that lost time.

Some federal agencies and uniformed services offer thrift savings plans.7

Early Midlife (Ages 36–50)

Early midlife tends to bring financial strains, including mortgages, student loans, insurance premiums, and credit card debt.

Still, it’s critical to continue saving at this stage of retirement planning. The combination of earning more money and the time you still have to invest and earn interest makes these years some of the best for aggressive savings.8

People at this stage of retirement planning should continue to take advantage of any 401(k) matching programs that their employers offer. They should also try to max out contributions to a 401(k) or Roth IRA (you can have both at the same time). For those ineligible for a Roth IRA, consider a traditional IRA. As with your 401(k), this is funded with pretax dollars, and the assets within it grow tax-deferred.

Some employer-sponsored plans offer a Roth option to set aside after-tax retirement contributions. You are limited to the same annual limit, but there are no income limitations as with a Roth IRA.9

Finally, don’t neglect life insurance and disability insurance. You want to ensure that your family can survive financially without pulling from retirement savings should something happen to you.

Later Midlife (Ages 50–65)

As you approach retirement, your investment accounts should become more conservative. Treasury bills (T-bills) are one of the most conservative investments, although their returns are also low compared to other investments.

People in this age group have a few advantages. These often include higher wages as well as more disposable income than younger savers.10

It's never too late to set up and contribute to a 401(k) or an IRA. One benefit of this retirement planning stage is catch-up contributions. From age 50 on, you can contribute an additional $1,000 a year to your traditional or Roth IRA and an additional $7,500 a year to your 401(k) in 2024.2

Other Investments

Those who have maxed out their tax-incentivized retirement savings options can consider other forms of investment to supplement your retirement savings. Certificates of deposit (CDs), blue-chip stocks, or real estate investments (like a vacation home that you rent out) can be reasonably safe ways to add to your nest egg.

You can also begin to get a sense of what your Social Security benefits will be and at what age it makes sense to start taking them. Eligibility for early benefits starts at age 62, but the retirement age for full benefits is 66.11

This is the time to look into long-term care insurance, which will help cover the costs of a nursing home or home care should you need it in your advanced years. If you don't properly plan for health-related expenses, especially unexpected ones, they can decimate your savings.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) offers an online calculator to estimate your eventual monthly payment.

Other Aspects of Retirement Planning

Retirement planning includes a lot more than simply how much you will save and how much you need. It takes into account your complete financial picture.

Your Home

For most Americans, the single biggest asset they own is their home. How does that fit into your retirement plan?

A home was considered an asset in the past, but since the housing market crash, planners see it as less of an asset than they once did. With the popularity of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), many homeowners are entering retirement in mortgage debt instead of well above water.

Once you retire, there’s also the question of whether you should sell your home and downsize. If you still live in the home where you raised a family, it might be bigger and costlier than you need or want.

Your retirement plan should include an unbiased look at your home and what to do with it.

Estate Planning

Your estate plan addresses what happens to your assets after you die. It should include a will that lays out your plans.

But even before that, you should set up a trust or use some other strategy to keep as much of it as possible shielded from estate taxes. 

As of 2024, the first $13.61 million of an estate is exempt from estate taxes (up from $12.92 million for 2023), but many people are finding ways to leave their money to their children in a way that doesn’t pay them in a lump sum.12

There may also be changes coming down the pipeline in Congress regarding estate taxes, as the estate tax amount is scheduled to drop to $5 million in 2026.13

Tax Efficiency

Once you reach retirement age and begin taking distributions, taxes become a bigger problem. Most of your retirement accounts are taxed as ordinary income tax.

That’s one good argument for considering a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), as both allow you to pay taxes upfront rather than upon withdrawal.1415

If you believe you will have a higher taxable income later in life, it may make sense to do a Roth conversion. An accountant or financial planner can help you work through such tax considerations.

Medical Insurance

Medical expenses tend to increase with age. You will have government-sponsored Medicare coverage at a modest cost to you, but many supplement its coverage with a Medicare Advantage or Medigap policy.

Your choices are many and complex. It's a good idea to start checking out your options well in advance of retiring.


How Do I Start a Retirement Plan?

Retirement planning isn't difficult. It's as easy as setting aside some money every month—and every little bit counts.

You can start with a tax-advantaged savings plan, either a 401(k) through an employer or an IRA through a bank or brokerage firm.

You may also want to consider talking to a professional, such as a financial planner or investment broker who can steer you in the right direction.

The earlier you start, the better. That's because your investments grow over time by earning interest. And you'll earn interest on that interest.

Why Is a Retirement Plan So Important?

A retirement plan helps you sock away enough money to maintain the same lifestyle you currently have after you retire. While you may work part-time or pick up the odd gig here or there, it probably won't be enough to sustain your current lifestyle. Social Security benefits will only take you so far. That's why it's important to have a viable long-term plan for a financially comfortable retirement.

What Are the Main Pieces of a Retirement Plan?

A retirement plan is about accumulating enough money to enable you to enjoy a comfortable life after work. There are a couple of key issues to keep in mind:

Consider how to minimize the taxes you owe on your retirement income. One way to do this is to sock away money in a Roth account or convert your traditional account to a Roth before you retire.
Don't overlook estate planning. You're taking care of your loved ones as you take care of yourself.
What Are the Options Beyond a 401(k)?

If you don't have access to a 401(k), you have a few options. You could open an individual retirement account (IRA). However, the contribution limit for IRAs is much lower than for 401(k)s: $7,000 vs. $23,000, respectively.16 There's also the solo 401(k) for self-employed workers. You might consider annuity, but be careful: they're typically illiquid and come with high fees. You can also put money in a brokerage account, though this won't benefit from the tax advantages of the accounts listed above.

The Bottom Line

Everyone dreams of the day they can finally say goodbye to the workforce. But doing so costs money. That's where retirement planning comes into play.

It doesn't matter at what point you are in your life. Setting aside money now means you'll have less to worry about later."

5. The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing, by Benjamin Graham

Benjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business’ worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as “margin of safety,” which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for stocks.

The revised edition includes commentary from The Wall Street Journal’s personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig that contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig’s commentary on every chapter, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it’s a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here.

6. A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, by Burton Malkiel

If Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company’s value. (Efficiency means a company’s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business’ worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market’s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough.

The book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call “strategic beta,” but I digress).

7. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, by Warren Buffett

Many consider Warren Buffett to be the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO, a position he’s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they’re selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway’s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to the success of his approach.

Each year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, and all of them are published on the company’s website, so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he’s often very funny to boot. The Essays of Warren Buffett weaves together Buffett’s essays into a sequential, cohesive book.

Finance and Investing Books Morningstar Specialists Are Reading

Morningstar employees and investing specialists recently shared their latest book picks. Here’s what they’re recommending:

1. How to Think About Money, by Jonathan Clements

“Jonathan Clements is an honest-to-goodness legend in investment writing, someone who manages to combine extreme clarity of thought with wisdom and wit. I’ve read practically every word that Jonathan has written since discovering him in the 1990s, and his work very much influenced my own career trajectory. Like all of Jonathan’s books, this one recognizes that successful financial plans are invariably rooted in thrift, knowing your values, and good old-fashioned common sense.” Christine Benz, Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning

2. Your Best Financial Life: Save Smart Now for the Future You Want, by Ann Lester

“I thought this was a great introduction for younger investors.” Amy Arnott, Portfolio Strategist

3. Just Keep Buying, by Nick Maggiulli

“Just Keep Buying focuses squarely on something that should be obvious but that seems to get criminally underplayed in the financial media: the importance of growing your income as an avenue to greater savings and investing opportunities. It also emphasizes the virtue of staying disciplined about investing by using a dollar-cost averaging program. It’s beautifully written.” Christine Benz, Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning

4. Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics, by Richard H. Thaler

“This is actually a core book for behavioral economics, so I’m a little late to the game, but it’s a good refresher of some core behavioral principles. It’s also interesting to get the ‘economics perspective’ versus the ‘psychology perspective” of some of these principles. Both groups thought about these inconsistencies in human behavior differently, so it’s fascinating to get an insider’s view on how both lines of thought became intermingled.” Samantha Lamas, Senior Behavioral Researcher

He believes that humans look for or come up with explanations when there aren’t any, emphasizing that sometimes things just simply happen. Seeking these explanations then affects our financial decisions and can form certain habits.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Today we’re welcoming back Ramit Sethi. Ramit is a personal finance expert and author. And this year, he added a new line item to his resume: TV host. His series How to Get Rich debuted on Netflix in April. It features in-depth conversations with individuals about their financial lives. Ramit’s first book, I Will Teach You to Be Rich, published in 2009, was a bestseller; a second edition of the book came out in 2019. Ramit is the founder of iwillteachyoutoberich.com and he’s also the host of a podcast called I Will Teach You To Be Rich, which features in-depth conversations with couples about money. Ramit, welcome back to The Long View.

Ramit Sethi: Thanks for having me again.

Benz: Well, thanks for being here. I think you’re our only three-repeat guest so far, so this is terrific.

Sethi: I’m flattered.

Benz: We want to talk about your new Netflix show How To Get Rich. You manage to find people who are super relatable and you do a great job of working with them. I guess the question is, is it hard to find people who are willing to open up that completely about their money situations? Or do you think it’s getting less taboo to talk about money?

Sethi: It is hard. It is hard to find and I’ve experienced it in two different ways. One on the show, and one on my own podcast where I interview couples. When we first started, we were not sure how open people would be with their finances because really, especially in America, sharing your finances is the most intimate thing you can do. Far more intimate than talking even about your sex life. There’s actually research indicating that people would be more likely to discuss that versus their credit card debt. But what we discovered is that some people are actually quite willing to share everything—all their financials, all their documents—if they believe that there is help at the end of the tunnel. And I really think that that speaks to how much people feel alone when it comes to money, that they’re actually willing to share anything and everything, if someone can actually help them.

Ptak: In one of the episodes, one of the people you were working with said that she was expecting to work with you on spreadsheets and net worth statements and so on, and she was surprised when you wanted to delve into relationships and other more personal aspects of financial decision-making. Was that type of reservation common in your interactions that people wanted to stay on a surface level, but you wanted to dig deeper in order to find out what was really going on?

Sethi: Always. People always think that I’m going to walk in and hand them some magical budget that’s going to solve all their financial problems. I go, “Do you even want that?” They go, “Yes!” I go, “Really? When was the last time you used a budget?” They go, “In 1998 we used it for three months.” I go, “You don’t even like budgets. So why do you want me to come in and give you a budget? That sucks!” But, it’s interesting where this idea comes from. The financial industry talks like this. They’ll say phrases: “Let’s give people the tools and the information to make the right decisions.” People aren’t robots. They don’t use information alone to make decisions. Most people are buying the things they want and then finding a way to logically justify it later. So, this whole myth that people sit down and rationally weigh out all the different decision-making principles, it’s a total myth. People buy what they want. They do not use ratios, almost ever when it comes to making huge financial decisions. And so yeah, I want to know how did they grow up with money? What phrases were said around the dinner table? How do they feel about money? And we can get to the numbers and we can talk ratios, but most people are quite surprised because they really think that I’m going to walk in with some calculator in my pocket and whip out some calculation. That’s not going to happen.

Benz: You’ve been having these conversations with people about their finances for a while. You referenced your podcast that you do with couples, and now the Netflix show. Have you gotten better at warming people up and getting them more comfortable with sharing some of the deeper details about how they got to the place that they’re at with their finances?

Sethi: Gosh, I sure hope so. I’ve been doing it a lot. So, if I haven’t, then there’s a real problem. I’ll leave it to you to judge. I’ve done about 100 episodes of my podcast. I think that there’s quite a marked difference between episode one and the most recent episode. I will share a couple of insights that I’ve had along the way. In order to get people to share this information, part of it is simply screening. It’s just making it very clear that we require you to share everything: income, debt, everything. And so, some people are not comfortable with that and that’s perfectly fine. But we don’t want any secrets. We want to know everything because that enables me to help you.

The other thing is I have been given the luxury of time. When I speak to people on my podcast, I block out three hours, but I always leave an extra hour just in case it runs long and it has run long. With the Netflix show, I had the opportunity to spend weeks with people. That meant I got to see them in person, I got to see them in their home, in their hometown. I also stayed in touch. I would text them when I was on a different coast, “Hey, what’s going on? Fill me in, let’s talk.” And I think people were surprised that I really cared—but I get invested. I’m eating lunch with them. I’m meeting their family. Their success becomes my success. So, the rapport-building with people is so important. I would argue it is at least as important as running any type of analysis. If people don’t like you and they don’t believe that you understand them, that’s the end of the conversation.

Ptak: Does it ever happen that people aren’t being totally honest with you about their actual financial situations? There were several scenes in the show where people dragged out piles of unpaid bills even though they had supposedly already given you all the details of their financial situations. Is that commonplace?

Sethi: It’s interesting. I wouldn’t know if they lied to me. But it almost seems preposterous that people would tell me the exact amount of debt that they would be openly crying about, something their mom said when they were seven years old and then they would be hiding some DMV bill. I think what is more common is that people use mental bucketing quite effectively to tell themselves a story. You see this commonly with people who have large amounts of student loan debt, such as Frank on the Netflix show. People simply count that as something totally different. They’ll go, “Well I make $70,000, and I have $10,000 in credit card debt, so I’m doing all right.” I go, “What about that $212,000 in student loan debt?” And they just look up they go, “Oh, I don’t really think about that.” I go, “Well, it’s debt, right?” They go, “Yeah, but I’m going to die with that.” And it’s kind of a joke, but it’s also kind of not. Again, mental bucketing—it is so overwhelmingly large or so intractable from their perspective that they simply do not even count it. And part of what I get to do is to say even if you have $200,000 of debt, we can make a plan and we can get on top of this, but we’ve got to be honest with ourselves and honest with the people around us.

Benz: I want to follow up on this mental-bucketing idea. Do you think that it can be healthy sometimes for people to have buckets in place, different silos of money? Or do you think it’s generally not a good idea.

Sethi: I think it can actually be quite effective if you use it strategically, so I’ll give you an example. I have what I call Ramit’s 10 money rules—these are my rules, they’re not yours. They’re just the rules that I’ve developed and some of them are quite straightforward, like save 10%, invest 20% of gross—basic stuff. Again, adjust the numbers if you want to borrow my rule for your own situation. But I also have ones like never question spending money on books, appetizers, health, or donating to a friend’s charity fundraiser. So, if I see anything relating to health or a book, done. I don’t care how much it costs, it’s not a question; I’m going to spend on it. I think that it is important for us to come up with a few categories or even items in our life where we say, I’m giving myself the freedom to not even think twice about it. And intuitively every parent knows this because if you ever bought a certain brand of diapers, you don’t care how much it costs you go, that’s my diaper, and that’s what I’m going to get. So, we all know that we’ve got something in our life we will spend anything on. My request for everyone is to be strategic about that and to really say, whether it’s “I love this brand of tuna” or “I love this pack of gum.” Or it could be as extravagant as “I love this brand of cashmere coat.” It’s up to you—what is your rich life? But I want you to be strategic about it and you can use mental bucketing to help that.

Ptak: Do you plan to follow up with people who you featured on the show to see whether they were able to enact positive long-term changes in their financial lives?

Sethi: Oh yes, in fact I have. I reached out to them and I have started sharing their recent stories, which are a year past when we filmed, on my podcast. And so most recently I have shared Matt and Amani’s story. They are the first couple that you see in episode one. And I’ve shared Natalie story, who you see also in episode one. I met her on Rodeo Drive. And I will be featuring as much of the cast as possible. So, you can actually see them on my YouTube videos and hear them and we go over all their numbers, what’s changed, and in some cases, what has not changed.

Benz: Well, that’s what I wanted to ask about. Thinking about those episode-one people especially, those were the ones I left a little bit worried about. But I’ll see where they went; I’ll follow up with you on that. I wanted to get back to your thesis, something that you talk a lot about, which is this idea of envisioning our what you call rich lives, and this is something we’ve talked about before. You’ve noted that when people talk about their rich lives they often talk about that in terms of what they don’t want to do versus something that they do want to do. Why do you think that is and what kinds of questions do you ask to get them to view their rich lives in a more positive light and to characterize them in a more positive light?

Sethi: It’s such a peculiar thing that we all do when asked what is your rich life? We will often respond by articulating a list of things we don’t want to do: “Well I don’t need to eat at the fanciest restaurants; it’s not like I need to fly on a private jet.” And we just start reciting this litany of phrases and I can see people, I can see their eyes and I watch them, and I bet you if I asked them 10 minutes later, do you remember what you told me? They would have no idea. It’s almost this automatic set of phrases of things they don’t want to do, and I believe that comes from the deep cultural, invisible scripts that we have around the puritanical nature of money in this country. That if we are actually able to forthrightly acknowledge what we want to do, what we would love to do, that we will be seen as frivolous or several other negative phrases that you can associate with the rich. And so, I want to take that idea of almost turning the word “rich” from an epithet to something that is aspirational. And again, your rich life can be yours. Your rich life is quite different than mine.

So, I do a few things; I use some techniques. I’ll ask them, “What does your rich life look like?” Almost everyone tells me the same answer: “I want to do what I want, when I want.” I go, “OK, what do you want?” They just stare at me with their mouth open. That really is a remarkable finding that most of us have never thought about our rich life. We go to work, we come home, we invest, we save. We agonize over the price of cereal, but we never actually thought about what it’s for. So, I’ll ask them another question: “What do you love spending money on? Not like, but love?” And everybody knows this intuitively. The most common answer is food, the next one is travel. The third one is health and wellness, and the fourth is convenience, and there’s a whole bunch of others. I call them money dials. I then follow up with a second question, I say “I love that. What if you could quadruple the amount that you spent on that? What would it look like and feel like?”

And this is such a beautiful moment because most of us have never actually envisioned spending more on the things we love. We’ve only been told by everyone around us and every financial expert out there that you got to cut back on everything: 5% on asparagus, 5% on housing, 5% on buses. So, somebody comes in here and goes “Wow, I love that you like to travel. What if you could quadruple it? Where would you go? Who would you take with you? What seat on the airline would you fly on?” So, those are a couple of techniques that I use. I go deeper—I’ll do a 10-year bucket list; I’ll talk about the perfect day. I’ll point out that in their perfect day, they certainly did not discuss spending an hour and a half on laundry. So might it be possible for us to use a little money to solve that problem? But overall, what I want to do is shift the conversation from one of negativity and restriction to one that’s actually fun and inspiring and your rich life fits you like a handmade glove.

Ptak: What do you think about bucket lists? It seems like they could be very polarizing. Some people like having a list of experiences they’re striving for while others think that people should work to make every day special, not just the African safari, so to speak. Where do you come down on that?

Sethi: I remember when I was applying to colleges and there was this FAQ from one very selective college and it said: Should students try to take an easier class and get an A or should they try to take a more difficult class and get a B? And the college was actually quite direct. They said we always encourage our prospects to take a more challenging class, but in our experience, our students take the more challenging class and they get an A. And I just love that. That lesson there is something I call yes and yes. Should you live a rich life today? Yes. And should you live an even richer life tomorrow? Yes. So, our rich life today might mean buying an extra charger for your phone, so you’ve got one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. What is that, $29? Fantastic. A richer life down the road could be at the end of this year you take a beautiful holiday and you spend an extra two days just the two of you. Or it might be three years from now where you celebrate your anniversary abroad, or a fantastic restaurant. So, I believe you can do both. Of course, you need to know your numbers, but beyond knowing your numbers, you’ve also got to create a vision, and that vision starts today and it can expand tomorrow.

Benz: Wanted to ask if it’s hard to set aside your own notions about financial management when working with people? On the show you featured a couple who are planning a wedding and finding that it was more expensive than they anticipated. And as I was watching that, my reaction was like, of course, they should shrink it! They should not have that expensive wedding. And yet they went and with your urging, they talked to their parents, and the parents agreed to kick in some funds for the wedding. So, I’m wondering how you deal with your own thoughts about prudent financial management when you are working with people who have a different world view?

Sethi: I’d love to answer that, but first I have a question for you, Christine. You said that you naturally thought that they should shrink their wedding. Why did you think that?

Benz: Well, I think there’s an elegance in doing what you can afford, and I think cheaper things can be done really elegantly. So, I guess that was what I was thinking like, oh, this could be so beautiful if it were a little smaller and just within your budget.

Sethi: Fantastic. OK, so this is beautiful. This really unearths some of our deeply held views about money. I come from an Indian background. If you know anything about Indian weddings, you know that they are extravagant, maximalist. They are cultural and family celebrations. In my culture, it is expected that you’re going to invite everybody in your community and in fact, that’s exactly what I did. I combined it with financial planning—I was saving for my wedding before I even met my wife because I knew one day I’m going to get married and I want to have an amazing wedding and I don’t even want money to be one of the top five concerns. So, I was putting money away diligently well in my 20s.

When I met Sarah and Reggie, who on the show were discussing a wedding, I asked them, “Is this important to you?” They said, “Yes.” I said, “Is it part of your rich life?” They said, “Yes.” I got curious. I said, “Tell me why.” And I know their background. They have a cultural background, which also encourages family bonding over weddings. I said, “OK great. We need to find a way to make sure that you can afford this. But if you want to spend a lot of money on this, let’s find a way to do it.” And so, my approach when it comes to working with people, whether on the show, my podcast, or through my newsletter, is not to tell people that’s a bad decision, because first of all I think a big wedding is awesome as long as you can afford it. I also think if you want to buy a dirt bike—I’m not into dirt bikes. I don’t ride on dirt bikes, but if you want to buy a dirt bike and it’s your rich life, I go, “Fantastic, let’s figure out how to use your money to do it.” So, often I have to put aside my own personal views. Like someone tells me, “Ramit, we retired in our 30s using your book and we drive around the country in an RV.” Personally, I don’t want to get an RV, but they love it. I go, “Fantastic. That’s your rich life; it’s totally different than mine.” That’s the beauty of intentionally designing your rich life.

Ptak: Wanted to shift and talk a bit about budgeting and conscious spending. You often talk about a conscious spending plan and you have a free spreadsheet that people can download. Can you talk about what that consists of?

Sethi: I’m not a fan of budgets. I don’t know anyone who effectively maintains a budget long term. And also, my worst hell on this planet is sitting and being 58 years old and tracking the price of asparagus at Safeway. I don’t want to live that life, ever. Furthermore, I actually find it very uninteresting. I spent this much last month—what does that tell me about going forward? And when you apply psychology to budgets, you recognize quickly why it does not stick. Here’s the basic message of budgets: “OK, everyday person on the street who doesn’t really pay attention to their money, I want you to open up a spreadsheet—again most people don’t even use Excel—I want you to open up a spreadsheet, I want you to find all the spending that you spent in the last 12 months. The spending that you don’t track at all and that you feel really guilty about. Go ahead and spend the next two months trying to gather all that information and type it in or integrate it somehow. And then you see a bunch of numbers and I want you to magically make sense of it and then use that to decide what to do next. By the way, you have to do this for the rest of your life.” Is it any surprise that no one actually keeps a budget for the long term.

The fact that this has not been discovered in the financial industry absolutely blows my mind, and I credit a lot of this to my studying psychology at Stanford when I realized certain things about how we are cognitive misers, how we carefully ration out our attention on the things that matter. And so, for me, I want to simplify and I want to focus on the high-leverage items in personal finance. I call them “the big wins.” And with a conscious spending plan—I think I have one at my website, iwt.com/csp. There’s four numbers that I track—I track these myself personally as well. The first one is fixed costs. And I give people an actual percentage. I find that specificity is really helpful. Fixed costs, 50% to 60% of take-home pay—that includes your rent or mortgage, utilities, any debt payments, cable, groceries, all the fixed stuff. Next category I track is savings, 5% to 10% of take home, although of course I’d love to see more. Next is investments, 5% to 10% of take home—of course I’d love to see more because that’s where real wealth is generated.

And then my last category is my favorite one: guilt-free spending, that’s 20% to 35% of take-home pay. So, you have those four numbers, you can actually sit down solo or with a partner. And you can say, “OK, let’s map it out—this takes us 15 minutes to get 85% of the way there. Let’s decide what do we want to do this year. Do we want to go to this great restaurant? Do we want to take a trip with our family? Do we care about a nice hotel? Oops, that doesn’t fit into our numbers. All right, let’s save a little bit more this year and we can do it next year.”

Benz: One thing that you talk a lot about is the role of time. So, how time relates to money and how people sometimes go through these steps to save money that ends up costing them a lot of time. Can you talk about how you approach that and how you want people to factor their own time into the financial decisions that they might make?

Sethi: I would love it if people stayed awake on a Saturday night researching different savings accounts like I do, but most people actually have a life, so they’re not going to do that. That’s life. That’s why they turn to people like me. And that’s why they come to you for advice as well. The fact of the matter is that I want people to spend less than an hour a month on their personal finances, not just because they’re ignoring it, that would be ineffective. But rather because they have systems set up that are automatically handling their savings, automatically handling their investments, and they even built in a little buffer in case their tire goes flat on their car.

When it comes to making big financial decisions, we are super irrational. I kind of love it honestly. It’s just the human condition. We’ll spend more time looking up what cool restaurant opened up to go out on a Saturday night, than we will researching the actual cost of buying a house. It’s absolutely bonkers. You have people who literally keep a massive Yelp page, or wherever they’re tracking their restaurants, and then you ask them what percentage of gross income is going toward housing. They’re like, what does gross mean? I go, OK, cool. Let’s start at the beginning.

The fact is, I can’t berate people for that because there’s a lot of stuff I don’t know. If you ask me how my car works, I have no idea, I just put the key in and it turns, great, let’s go. So, what I often do is say, let’s get the big things right. Let’s make sure that by default your money is being saved, it’s being invested, and also you feel guilt-free when you go out to eat at a restaurant, you can order dessert. You don’t have to spend a ton of time, but you do have to get the high-leverage items right. Those would be things like buying a house, buying a car, any type of debt that you might be taking out. Get those right and then the price of coffee does not really matter.

Ptak: Some of the people you feature in the show are shouldering heavy levels of debt. How can people in that situation find a rich life even as the process of debt paydown can be kind of a slog. Do you have any hacks that you can share?

Sethi: Jeff, a lot of it is psychological. It’s this idea that it’s overwhelming and I’m never even going to get out from under this. And sometimes just talking to somebody like me, who comes along and says, look you’re going to be OK. I’ve talked to people with $50,000 of debt, I’ve talked to people with $800,000 of debt and we can make a plan. We can get this going. It might take some time, but we can do it. And just hearing somebody say that you’re going to be OK, goes a long way. Interestingly, 90% of the people I talk to who have debt do not know how much debt they owe. Why would they? They don’t want to open those envelopes and those emails, it’s just bad news. And 95% of people with debt who I speak to do not know their debt-payoff date. To me, that’s actually a huge opportunity.

It’s kind of like when I’ve waited in line for In-N-Out, that burger place in California, and it always has a long line, especially if you’re outside in the drive-through. And what they do is something very clever—they have somebody standing outside who takes your order and the minute you give your order you’re still waiting in line for another 20 minutes. But you just feel, they know my order, they’re making it. There’s just this sense of relief. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel. So, I’ll talk to people like Frank on the show, or like others on my podcast, who have $50,000, $100,000, $300,000 even more debt, and we will work through it together. They don’t even know how much they owe. We’ll pull out the papers, we’ll plug them into a calculator and they will see, oh my gosh, in 2041, December, my debt will be paid off. OK, that’s a long time away, but at least they know.

And once we get that win, I give them a high five through the screen or in person. I go, “Great, we know! OK, it’s 20 years. But we know!” Then I go, “Just do me a favor, add $50 a month to that debt, just see. Let’s just see what happens.” And that often shrinks that debt by years, and you can see their eyes go wide. That is the moment they’ve made the connection. The fact that they can take control. They don’t yet understand interest rates and time, value of money. They don’t understand that, nor do they need to at this point—all they need to know is they can see their future on-screen and they can affect it. And that is a powerful moment.

Benz: On the show, you talk about jobs and income in addition to just spending, which I appreciated. Several of the people you featured on the show earned their income in nontraditional ways. A couple of the people were influencer types and another was involved in multilevel marketing, which I learned a little bit about during the show. How do you go about getting people in such roles to be realistic about their earnings potential while not quashing their dreams to pursue whatever sort of career trajectory they’re interested in?

Sethi: Christine, that’s why I get paid the big bucks. You’re right. How do I help them be realistic—because frankly, if you’re going to be an influencer, your kind of delusional anyway—and then also encourage them? That is a very fine line to do. So, there’s a lot of different techniques that I use. Sometimes I’ll say, “How’s it going?” A lot of times they’re just like, “Oh, it’s not going well.” I go, “OK, how long has it not been going well for?” They’re like, “Four years.” I’m like, “Is anything going to change in the next four years?” And no one has really asked them that, and I’m doing it in a nice way. Yes, we’re talking about something kind of depressing, but I’m smiling. I’m like, “You think anything’s going to change? Come on, tell me the truth.” And I think that rapport goes a long way.

Sometimes I will share views that they never actually thought about. For example, if somebody is going to go full time as an influencer, they may not realize that they’re now responsible for certain taxes and withholding, and so on. And they’re going to have variable incomes where they make $20,000 in one month and then nothing for six months. And I might just ask them, “Hey, how would you handle that?” And they their eyes go wide because they realize they never thought about that. Sometimes I have to be extremely straightforward and honest. In the case of the MLM … I really hate MLMs. I just hate them. They are predatory, almost no one who participates in them is successful, and they use a variety of psychological techniques that I find highly unethical. So, I had the opportunity—I was actually shocked, I did not know this before I met her. But I had the opportunity to speak to someone who’s involved in MLM. In fact, I went to an MLM conference.

Benz: Ramit, can you explain what that is, because I had to Google it while I was watching it.

Sethi: Multilevel marketing.

Benz: Yeah.

Sethi: Well, many of us confuse multilevel marketing. There’s a sort of a relation, although we confuse it with a pyramid scheme. But some of us have heard some of these MLM companies, and there’s a variety of different characteristics that MLMs have. Often you will know about them because they are encouraging their friends and family to join and to sell as well. There’s a variety of these things we all probably grew up hearing about these. It’s very tricky because they are right on the border of being illegal, but they’re not, and they have a very strong legal background in my opinion, a lot of these should just be completely outlawed. If you look at the statistics, people involved in MLMs almost never make money, but they are conveniently portrayed as a way to make passive income while working from home, and so on, American dream, blah blah blah.

I had the chance to talk about this on camera with someone who’s involved in an MLM and what was really interesting was that she had actually made quite a bit of money one month and then she had not made that much in a long time. And I know from my background in psychology, same dynamics used in slot machines. That if you win once, you tend to want to go back for variable reinforcement. You love the idea that you might just be winning just that one more slot-pull. And a lot of that is quite unethical. So, it’s my job to help people gently see it, but it’s also my job to recognize that they are going to do what they are going to do. It’s not my life, it’s theirs. I can share my perspective. Sometimes I can tell them point blank, “I would never do this, I think you should stop.” But ultimately I have to do it in a way that allows me to be honest but let them make the decision.

Ptak: Wanted to shift gears and talk about homeownership. You’re sometimes characterized as anti-homeownership. Your position seems more nuanced than that. Can you share your thoughts on homeownership more broadly?

Sethi: The fact that I am considered anti-homeownership because I encourage people to run the numbers on the biggest purchase of their lives, shows you how far the pro-homeownership propaganda runs in this country. It is totally absurd. Let me make my position very clear: I believe that you should run the numbers when you go to buy a house, because sometimes buying a house can be a great financial decision, sometimes renting can be a great financial decision, and sometimes renting can actually be a better financial decision than buying a house. I have rented by choice for about 20 years. I’ve lived in San Francisco, New York, LA. I could buy a house today. And I choose to rent, for a variety of reasons, including lifestyle and financial, and I have made more money renting than I would have owning—a lot more. Why?

Because most of us simply take the bigger number and we subtract the other number and we go, “Granny bought a house in Austin, Texas, in 1970 for $100,000 and Granny just sold it for $1 million, Granny made $900,000.” I go, “Have you ever heard the word inflation? Do you know what that is? How many times did Granny replace her washer and dryer? And how about that concrete in the back? And also, what about the opportunity cost of that down payment? And also, what about her labor time going to Home Depot? You ever considered that?” They go, “No, no, no, but it’s $900,000.” I go, “Pick up a calculator and don’t talk to me until you run the numbers.”

We are blind to running the numbers because in this country we have propaganda: “Owning a home is the best investment you’ll ever make. You’re throwing money away on rent.” Funny, nobody ever said you’re throwing money away at a restaurant. “You’re paying your landlord’s mortgage.” Funny, you never seem to be concerned about paying your sushi restaurant owner’s mortgage. But suddenly we use these almost-religious phrases when it comes to buying a house. Buying a house can be good—you might make money, you might not. You probably are not going to get the numbers right unless you actually run them. Renting can be fine as well. So, I particularly hate when I hear young people feeling guilty and feeling ashamed that they are renting. Never feel guilty for renting it can actually be a fantastic financial decision, but you need to run the numbers.

Benz: One of your rules for homeownership is that people should have a 10-year time horizon in mind for living in the house. Can you walk us through how you arrive at that?

Sethi: If you look at an amortization table, well, first of all, let me just say that I just lost like 98% of people listening right now because the word amortization doesn’t even sound good. No one even knows what that is. They spend more time picking their tile than they do actually typing out the word amortization calculator. So let me just establish, I’m sure everyone just dropped off this podcast. When we go to buy a house, a lot of people, they start throwing around all these words really fervently: “Well I’m building equity.” OK, how much equity are you building? “Well, it’s equity; I’m throwing money away on my rent.” I go, “Have you ever looked at amortization table? Do you know that in the first 10 years you’re basically paying majority interest?” They don’t even know what is interest, what is principal. Again, I’m not blaming anyone, these are complex concepts, but if you’re going to buy a house. You better understand this.

So, in the first 10 years of homeownership—again, depending on location, cost, and so on—you will often find that you are spending more simply paying interest than you are putting toward the principal. And I show this. I posted a video with a calculator and I show people the calculations on my social media. If you leave in the first 10 years and you factor in all the closing costs, all the transaction costs, all the maintenance and new furniture costs, it’s often common that you’ll find you actually lost money. Now this is shocking to people. They go, “What are you talking about? I bought it for $360,000, I sold it for $400,000. I made $40,000.” I go, “OK, show me the $40,000.” “Well, there’s this thing and then we got recurring, I don’t …” You did not make that much when you subtract out all the fees. So, it’s important as some general guidelines to, for example, plan to stay for at least 10 years. If you leave after 9.5, OK fine I’m not going to do anything to you. But the longer you stay, the more that you’ll be able to spread those costs like peanut butter. Spread them out over many years, which starts to make equity buildup actually possible.

Ptak: We wanted to ask you maybe a question or two about investing. You don’t go too deep on investing in the show except to tout index funds and give the basics on asset allocation. But one of the people you profiled had gone down the rabbit hole of trading and was trying to claw his way back to break even. How did you convince him to give up that pursuit?

Sethi: This is a great question because traders are very difficult to persuade to stop. The research shows that most of these traders will lose money over the long term. They hardly ever make money. I see them on Twitter, their username on Twitter has the word trader in it. I’m already like, oh God. And then they start giving me advice on investing. I’m like, why would I take advice from a guy who has the word trader in his username and has a picture of a goat? Trust me, I’m not taking any type of financial or otherwise advice from Mr. Goat over here. The problem is that traders, like gamblers, really believe that success is just around the corner, and sometimes they even taste success. “Oh my God, I bought this one stock and it went up 200%. Oh, that’s so fantastic.” And sometimes they actually sold and made money from it. The problem is that as we know, you cannot do that consistently over the long term. You will lose—even fancy people wearing fancy suits in New York on Wall Street, they lose. So, the simplest thing to do is to accept the research that says low-cost passive investing is going to be the superior investing strategy over the long term.

Issues with that, as I already mentioned, they’ve got the gamblers fallacy. In America we don’t want to be average at anything, even though by definition, most of us are. And so, people go, “I don’t want average; 7% that’s so boring. It’s going to take me a long time to make money.” I go “Oh, God, whatever; I’m not trying to convince you anymore.” So, in Christian’s case on the show, he had actually done quite well through his diversified 401(k). He’d done really well, so I let it cook a little bit. Sometimes I don’t need to make the point right up front. I just let it cook. And we found out on camera that he had lost tens of thousands of dollars, even his wife didn’t know. That was a great moment, by the way. I was like go ahead, talk amongst yourselves. And at the same time, I also asked both of them—they’re a fantastic couple—I said, “What is your rich life? What do you want to do together?” And they told me this beautiful vision—they wanted to build an empire together. They want to retire Christian’s mom. They want to do all these beautiful things. I said, “Great, you can do this. Let’s make it happen. But let’s take a look at what’s going on here.”

And when I raised the stakes for them and I helped them cocreate a vision, then it became clear that some of the dysfunctional financial behaviors they were using were not serving them. But if I had just come in and kicked down the door and said, “Stop picking stocks!” They would have taken one look and said thank you very much, but no thanks. So, my job involves helping people create a vision of a rich life and then often they realize that their own behaviors are not serving them.

Benz: I’d like to get your take on crypto. You had this great metaphor about how the parts of our portfolios are like the different pieces in a wardrobe and you compared the crypto piece to Crocs, quite disparagingly—sort of suggesting you do not need this, this is not going to look good on you. Can you walk us through your thoughts on crypto?

Sethi: Well, I think crypto is a great way if you want to speculate; it’s fantastic, it’s quite volatile. I think that if you have a fully diversified portfolio and you’ve handled everything, it’s all automated and you go, “You know what, I want to take 1% to 5% of my portfolio and have some fun with it.” Fantastic. The problem is that when I talk to these crypto zealots—who, by the way, have all disappeared in the last year and a half—they would go, “I’m all in on crypto.” I go, “Do you have a diversified portfolio?” And they look at me like I’m some old dude and they go, “Diversification, that’s for like boomers.” And I just go, “You are doomed, there’s nothing I can do to help you.” The idea that your investments should become your identity is the beginning of the end. And you see that when you have these jokers with laser eyes on Twitter going around posting all these meme stocks and saying cryptos about fiats over blah blah blah, all these arguments hold no water whatsoever.

Not surprisingly, exhibiting many cult dynamics that I studied in college—inner language, in group, out group, all kinds of stuff. Well, guess what, most of these folks lost a lot of money and they all seemed to vanish. A lot of people who message me, because I’m very open about crypto and the dynamics around it, they all delete their accounts, they’re gone. The ones that stay though, fascinatingly, continue to post about crypto. I’m like, wow, you’ve lost 70% of your money, you just keep posting, like that’s going to work. Keep posting bro, I’m sure it’s all coming back. And again, I don’t mind if people have a little fun with money and investing, once you have a fully diversified portfolio. But what you often find if you really dig deep and I have, I’ve spoken to thousands of crypto—I’m not even calling them investors, they’re speculators—and really one of the chief arguments deep down that they admit is, “If I were to simply adopt a passive investing strategy, it would take me a long time to make money. I’m impatient, I don’t want to wait. Therefore, I’m going all in now, because this is my one chance.” And I simply just reject that premise.

Ptak: You’ve talked about couples and interactions that you’ve had with them about their financial lives at various points during our conversation. So, one perennial debate in the context of couples is whether they should combine everything, maintain separate accounts, or use kind of a hybrid system. The question is, which of those is favorable in your opinion?

Sethi: I’ll tell you my opinion, but I’ll also tell you what I see with couples. My opinion, what I would prefer, is that people use a hybrid system, which is a joint account that covers joint expenses and then separate individual accounts with money that has no questions asked, you like it for massage, you like it for golf, whatever. I don’t always see that, I don’t always see that, and here’s something really interesting I’ve learned about account structures in couples. Many people have joint accounts. Many people do not combine accounts. That alone is not indicative of whether they are going to be successful or not with money. What is much more indicative, is that couples who actually sit down and talk about how they want their money to work together, they tend to set up joint accounts. So, it’s not the joint accounts that make people in relationships successful, it’s the fact they actually sat down and talked about it. And I know this because I speak to couples who sat down, intentionally talked about it, and said, we want to keep separate accounts. And they’re doing great. So, it’s not the accounts per se that determine whether a couple is going to be successful or not; it’s that they are talking about it and talking about it regularly.

Benz: Do you think it’s generational? I remember encountering this separate account thing and I have to say it was kind of alien to me. I assumed everyone who is married did fully combine financials, but do you think it does vary by generation?

Sethi: I do, and I think there’s a variety of reasons for that. Historically, we may have seen, particularly in older couples, that one partner was the primary breadwinner or may have been the only earner in the relationship. Now you’ll see both members of a relationship tending to work. There’s also people are getting married later, which means they’ve become much more established with their accounts. So, there’s a variety of dynamics beyond simply, which bank account are people using. But absolutely, I agree with you, generationally, the younger couples I see are much more likely to have separate accounts or keep separate accounts than the older couples I speak to, who almost overwhelmingly have combined their accounts.

Ptak: You’re also not a big fan of couples fully delegating financial matters to just one partner. Why is that not a great idea? After all, couples delegate household jobs or chores all the time. Why is it not sensible when it comes to financial matters?

Sethi: We do. Every couple has one partner who tends to do certain tasks and another partner who tends to do others, and it might be you empty the dishwasher, I’m taking out the trash. But we don’t delegate certain things. It would be very rare these days to see one partner exclusively handling parenting. That’s just not really how things are done anymore and what that speaks to is that there are certain things in a relationship where one person can handle it. The stakes are relatively low. Oh, wow, you didn’t load the dishwasher correctly, all right, whatever. But when it comes to big, big, big things, like parenting and money, those cannot be delegated. And I’ll tell you in my relationship what happened.

So, if you think about delegation, technically I should probably be the one managing money in our relationship. When we met, I had already been running my business for about 15 years and I’m pretty good at money. I think about it every day because of my business, I know how to invest. But pretty early on, I told my now wife, I said I’d like for us to both be involved in our money and I’ll tell you why. First, I’m going to get hit by a bus one day, something’s going to happen. And the worst thing for me would be to leave you defenseless not knowing where the money is, how it works, or be able to protect you from the inevitable circling sharks. Second, I want us to have a second set of eyes. I don’t want to just be doing this myself. I want us to create a culture of stewardship in our family. We know that we’re going to use money strategically for our own life, for our family and certainly for charity. We got to do this together. And then finally, it’s just a lot more fun. It’s a lot more fun to have a partner, doing it together, especially when you can dream together and that is really the crux of it. When we think of money, we often think of obligations and debt payoffs and bill pay. All that stuff, that’s 1% of it. When I think of money, I think of taking a trip to India to see my family. I think of tipping huge when I go out. I think of a beautiful coat that I can buy. I think of the things that make me happy and will make us happy and that is why delegating just to one person in a relationship, is in my opinion, a very, very unhealthy behavior.

Benz: I want to address couples with varying incomes, unequal levels of income, where one person’s earning a lot more. That happened on a few occasions on the show. So that can create a power imbalance in the relationship. There was one stay-at-home dad, I think you picked up on the fact that there was sort of a power imbalance going on there. Do you have any strategies for resolving the tensions that can arise in that sort of situation?

Sethi: It’s so interesting to watch the power dynamics emerge when it comes to money, and in the case on episode one, you met Matt and Amani. And Matt stayed home, and Amani is quite a high earner. And that’s quite fascinating for a variety of reasons, including that it sort of bends our cultural understanding that for so long in America, people have simply accepted that in a heterosexual relationship he might earn more than she does. But that’s changing. In fact, in major cities, young women in their 20s earn more than young men. And this is something that needs to be talked about because it’s very, very taboo to talk about money and power, money and gender. And I actually love shining a light on these topics. I have an episode 65 on my podcast. There’s a young woman, she has been dating this guy for about a year. And she says to me, “I want him to pick up the check at dinner.” He says, “OK I try to. But when I slide my credit card across the table, she slides it back and says ‘I want you to invest in your Roth IRA.’” OK, interesting.

Then I find out that he recently started a business—he makes $2,000 a month and she makes $200,000 per month. She’s making 100 times what he makes, so here we have power. We have class, we have gender all coming together on episode 64 and 65 of the podcast. And with couples with big divergent incomes, the best thing I do is simply shine a light on this elephant in the room. I say, “How does it feel to earn more?” And you’ll discover some really peculiar things. The lower earner almost always is obsessed with the C word, contributing—”I want to contribute.” If someone’s making 2 times, 3 times, 5 times, 100 times more, it’s probably unlikely that you can financially contribute to the same level. And one of the things I share very candidly with people is that in a relationship, yeah, money is important, but it’s just one small part of a rich life. There are so many other ways that partners can contribute, and so we open that discussion up. We talk about what would it look like, what would make you feel happy, do you feel worried, do you feel ashamed? And what would it take for you both to feel good about money? That’s the starting point.

Ptak: One of the people you work with was paying a financial advisor a percentage of assets every year, in this case 1%. You suggested that she look for an hourly advisor. Why do you think that’s a better model for financial advice?

Sethi: The vast majority of people who are paying 1% have no idea what that means, and that’s exactly how Wall Street has designed it. One percent seems so innocent—oh 1%, no big deal. Little do people know that that will be approximately 28% of their lifetime returns and paying 1% is not the same as hiring somebody to mow your lawn. You would never pay that person a percentage of your portfolio. I got a lot of heat from financial advisors who predictably do not like Ramit Sethi out there saying you shouldn’t pay 1% AUM. And I want to be really clear: I have no problem, paying an advisor an hourly fee, even a hefty hourly fee. I think you should pay for premium advice. I myself have hired a financial advisor to give me a second set of eyes on my own asset allocation. But never AUM—that you do not get better performance, your incentives are not aligned, and worst of all, people genuinely have no idea how much 1% actually cost them.

Benz: Well, Ramit this has been such a terrific discussion. We really appreciate you taking the time out to be with us today.

Sethi: Thank you for having me back. I always enjoy our conversations.

Ptak: Oh, likewise. Thanks again.

Hi everyone. We’re taking the week off for the 4th of July holiday, but we wanted to use this week’s episode to honor Nobel Prize-winning economist Harry Markowitz, who recently passed away at the age of 95. Professor Markowitz is a giant of finance, someone who put diversification and Modern Portfolio Theory on the map, with his research transforming the way we allocate and invest our assets. While we didn’t have the opportunity to interview Professor Markowitz for the podcast, we were able to chat recently with someone who had interviewed him: author and financial researcher Dr. Andrew Lo. Dr. Lo recently published a book titled “In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio,” in which he profiled some of the leading figures in academic research and finance. None stood taller than Professor Markowitz, whom Dr. Lo discusses at length in this interview we aired in February of 2022. We think you’ll enjoy it. Thanks so much for listening and see you in a week. Have a happy holiday.

Our guest this week is Dr. Andrew Lo. Dr. Lo is the Charles E. & Susan T. Harris Professor, a professor of finance, and the director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at the MIT Sloan School of Management. His current research spans five areas, including evolutionary models of investor behavior and adaptive markets, systemic risk, and financial regulation, among others. Dr. Lo has published extensively in academic journals and authored a number of books including In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio, which he cowrote with Stephen Foerster. He has received numerous awards for his work and contributions to modern finance research throughout his career.

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer at Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Ptak: Our guest this week is Dr. Andrew Lo. Dr. Lo is the Charles E. & Susan T. Harris Professor, a professor of finance, and the director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at the MIT Sloan School of Management. His current research spans five areas, including evolutionary models of investor behavior and adaptive markets, systemic risk, and financial regulation, among others.

He has received numerous awards for his work and contributions to modern finance research throughout his career. He holds a bachelor’s in economics from Yale University and an AM and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University.

Dr. Lo, welcome to The Long View.

Dr. Andrew Lo: Thanks for having me.

Ptak: It's our pleasure. Thanks so much for joining us. In your new book In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio, you trace the history of investing and finance all the way back to the Neolithic era. But modern portfolio diversification really originated with three young girls in late-18th century Switzerland. Can you tell that story?

Dr. Lo: Well, it's actually 30 young girls, Trente Demoiselles, and it has to do with actually the American Revolution. So, as you probably know, France was involved in supporting us in that effort, and they had to pay for it somehow. So, the French government, Louis XVI, decided to borrow from private citizens. And in exchange for these loans what he promised in return were basically life annuities. So, if you lent the French government a certain amount of money, they would pay you back a certain payment every year for the rest of your natural life. But there was one really interesting catch to this, and that is that it wasn't necessarily just your life, you could designate somebody else, and as long as that person was alive, the payments would continue. So, naturally, what you'd want to do is to select a rather young individual to be able to keep on receiving payments as long as he or she were alive.

And so, this particular arrangement was taken advantage of by a number of Swiss investors in the town of Geneva. These Swiss bankers figured out that if you pooled a number of these loans in an investment portfolio, and you selected relatively young people to be the individuals on which these loans were based, you can actually extend the payments from the French government. And so, these interesting funds were called Trente Demoiselles de Geneve, because these Genevan bankers created so many of them. And typically, they had 30 individuals, generally young women from Geneva, hence the name, Trente Demoiselles. And so, these women were selected—they were actually girls—they were selected between the ages of 5 and 10. And after they survived smallpox, they would then be presented to the French government as the individuals to which the loans were going to be assigned. And so, diversification was clearly recognized at that time, the 30 young maidens from Geneva per fund, and shares in these investment funds were sold, they were transferred. So, the early form of securitization was part of this process. It was really quite sophisticated. And investors did very, very well until, of course, at some point, the French government ultimately went bankrupt, and a number of investors lost their money. So, not at all an unfamiliar story from our perspective.

Benz: You point out that serious investment theory didn't really emerge until the 1900s, which is when Irving Fisher, John Maynard Keynes, and several others published major academic treatises on economics. Why did it take so long?

Dr. Lo: That's a really tough question because there are many different factors involved. And I'm no expert in history, so I have to be careful about answering that. But if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that there are probably two factors involved. One is that the motivation for having a systematic approach to investing really didn't develop until you actually had the need and the resources to be able to apply these kinds of mathematics. And so, that really didn't develop until the 1900s. Basic bond math, interest-rate calculations, even compound interest, those are things that are relatively modern from a mathematical perspective.

But I think there's another reason why it may not have become as popular as it did in the 1900s. And that was really because of cultural and socioeconomic factors. In order for investments to be considered a respectable profession, you needed to have a pretty significant middle class and a particular business class to take investments seriously. And so, I think it really took that kind of process to create a situation where enough people were interested in order to justify the kind of resources that ultimately went into creating an entire industry around the investment process.

Ptak: Christine just mentioned Keynes, who was not just a brilliant economic theorist, but also a very accomplished investor. As you point out in the book, he successfully managed the Cambridge University endowment for 25 years until his death in 1946. Yet, unlike in economics, where he made a huge and lasting impact, his investing legacy didn't live on. What lessons could investors have learned from how he managed the Cambridge endowment?

Dr. Lo: Well, there's a really interesting story about that that we describe in the book, which is that his track record was really quite impressive over the course of 20-some-odd-year period for investing for the University of Cambridge. He generated a compound return of something on the order of 14%, 15%. But the interesting part about that story is the fact that that return was really two components that are broken down into the returns from 1922 to 1932, where the return that he generated was about 1.3%, and from 1933 to 1946, during that period of time, he generated about an 18% return. And the difference, according to a paper by Chambers and Dimson, was the fact that he recognized somewhere in the process that his earlier investment style wasn't working, and that more of a bottom-up fundamental stock-picking value-investor style actually worked better.

So, he started out with a top-down kind of an approach and ultimately ended up bottom-up Benjamin Graham-type of investment style. First of all, that tells us that there's something to be said for value investing, and that Benjamin Graham does have some merit to his approach. But it also says that one needs to be adaptive because market conditions change, and when one discovers that the particular approach is not working, then it's time to adapt and change investment philosophies. So, I think that's probably the biggest takeaway that I got from the story, which is that even something as important as endowment investing is not nearly the kind of science that we would like it to be, and an economist of Keynes' stature, even he ended up engaging in trial and error to be able to achieve that kind of performance.

Benz: The book asks whether there is a perfect portfolio that offers the ideal mix of risk and reward. And to answer that question, you profiled 10 thought leaders who have come to shape the way that we think about portfolio theory and construction. Can you talk about those theories that you profiled and how you chose them?

Dr. Lo: Well, it's actually pretty easy. The book really grew out of what I would call a very thinly veiled version of hero worship. My coauthor, Steve Foerster, and I, obviously were trained in academic finance. And if you're trained in that tradition, there are just a very small number of absolute giants, both in academia as well as in industry, that have really transformed the way we think about investing. So, the people that we chose were simply the 10 giants, the founders of modern finance, both on the theoretical and academic perspective, as well as from the industry perspective. These are the individuals that have had the most influence in both the theory and practice of modern investing and ones that really changed the way Steve and I think about the field. So, from that perspective, it was a pretty easy set of choices.

Ptak: Something we've discussed at some length on this podcast and in other work we've done is the idea that investors shouldn't make perfect the enemy of good when it comes to building a portfolio. A portfolio isn't ""perfect"" if an investor is likely to misuse it. Did that come up in your conversations with the luminaries you interviewed? And, if so, did they think we need to tweak our definition of the theoretically perfect portfolio to reflect reality?

Dr. Lo: It definitely did come up. And, of course, we chose the title purposely. To be a little bit controversial, most people would argue that there is no such thing as a perfect portfolio. And yet, all of us seem to be constantly striving to achieve that level of perfection. And in a way, that's really what the book is about and how we end it. We basically point out that this is a never-ending journey, that we're constantly looking to improve the way we think about investing. And each one of the luminaries that we interviewed had their own version of what perfection means. And that's also part of our goal was to elicit the particular viewpoints of these individuals, knowing full well that they don't agree, but in a way, that's what we're looking for. We learn when we find other people who disagree with us. And so, just trying to understand the different kinds of disagreements gives us a much richer tapestry of the entire investment landscape. And in the end, I think that's what readers will benefit from, it's knowing the different perspectives and when certain perspectives are appropriate and applicable, and when others aren't.

Benz: There's a tendency to fight the last war, and that probably holds for portfolio construction, too. Thinking back to 2009 and 2010, it seemed like everyone was talking about risk parity and tactical asset allocation. But now that the markets have roared back, that's quieted down. Given this, what do you think constitutes a bona fide portfolio construction framework, especially knowing that different approaches can yield different outcomes, even over long stretches?

Dr. Lo: Well, a great example of that issue is the COVID pandemic. If we think about how things were looking, let's say, January of 2020, I think the markets were going great guns, we had a fantastic year the year before that. And then, of course, sometime around February COVID reached U.S. shores, and all of a sudden, financial markets panicked, we had a pretty significant drop in major indexes. And over a four- or five-week period, it really looked like there was going to be no end to this terrible affliction. But, of course, there is an end and markets take that into account. And a few months after the panic started in February, markets actually recovered. And so, I think that's a really interesting microcosm for the lesson that we learned from talking with all of these financial leaders is that a perfect portfolio is one that will adapt to both an individual's changing circumstances as well as market conditions. And so, what's perfect today may not be perfect tomorrow. And so, we constantly have to be thinking about reshaping our portfolio, and not only the portfolio, but the portfolio strategy, and trying to adapt those particular changes to the current conditions that apply. I think that's probably the biggest lesson. It's that among these 10 luminaries, we now understand many different ways of applying these tools to different market conditions. So, I would say that being forewarned is being forearmed. And I think that providing readers with all of these various different perspectives will give them an opportunity to apply each and every one of them as market conditions change.

Ptak: And I think we want to get into some of those different perspectives as we continue with our conversation. Before we do that, I wanted to talk about some of those luminaries that you profiled, the first of which is a giant in the field. All of these are giants in the field, but maybe he arguably looms largest, is Harry Markowitz. You explained in the book, in telling his story, that if it weren't for a chance encounter, Markowitz might never have gone down the path that eventually led to his research on Modern Portfolio Theory. Can you talk about that chance encounter?

Dr. Lo: It was a very strange story that Harry told about being in a, I think it was a waiting room, and trying to get some feedback on some work that he had done. And it turned out that that feedback ended up leading him toward thinking about portfolio optimization, which he would have never done had it not been for that occasion. And, of course, portfolio theory is such an important part of what we do in modern finance, that it's kind of hard to imagine that it was really due to that random event that got him down that path to think about how to apply optimization processes to this particular setting.

Ptak: It was a stockbroker in his doctoral advisors' waiting room, wasn't it, who said,

“Maybe take a look at the market.” And that eventually led him down the path he went down, correct?

Dr. Lo: That's right. And I think that he had very little experience with investing prior to that. He had no particular interest in it. But given the tools that he had at his disposal and given the problem that was proposed to him, it was just a natural application.

Benz: As you explained in the book, there had been little academic interest in portfolio management until Markowitz came along. Now there are whole journals devoted to the topic. But back then, the disinterest reflected attitudes toward the stock market, which was perceived as a bit of a backwater, right?

Dr. Lo: Absolutely. It's really quite a stunning change, because when Markowitz started applying these principles, nobody had any interest in portfolio optimization. And today, I don't imagine there's a financial analyst out there who doesn't know of mean-variance analysis. A very interesting story that Harry tells is at his thesis defense, when Milton Friedman, who was on his thesis committee, half-jokingly said, ""Well, we can't really give him a Ph.D. in economics, because, of course, this isn't really economics, it's just math."" And Harry Markowitz I think had the last laugh, when, as part of his Nobel acceptance speech, he mentioned this story. And he said that, ""Well, at that time, Friedman was right. It wasn't economics or finance. But now, it is.""

Ptak: In one afternoon—I think you recount this in the book—Markowitz had worked out the two major inputs to what became Modern Portfolio Theory: correlation and the notion of mean-variance optimization, as well as the notion of an efficient frontier. Can you talk about how those discoveries changed portfolio construction, maybe by contrasting with how it had been done up to that point?

Dr. Lo: This is really quite a stunning achievement, and it's one that most people aren't aware of, because they just take for granted that we now think about correlation, diversification, and portfolio construction the way we've always done it. But, in fact, prior to Markowitz, the way that people thought about investments was really from the perspective of the portfolio manager, the culture, and the personalities involved. They were often called gunslingers. Because these were larger-than-life celebrities that were able to pick stocks in much the way that certain art experts are able to pick the very best pieces of art. And so, that's the way that the investment industry operated until, I would say, the 1960s and '70s, well past the first decade after Markowitz's publication.

But something happened in that process, which is that portfolio managers began to see a different way of constructing portfolios, not by picking the best stocks, but rather by creating a combination of securities that had good properties overall. And correlation was a key feature. What you wanted to do was to put together a collection of securities that were not all highly correlated, not highly related. And the reason for that is you wanted to make sure that you had good diversification, not putting all your eggs in the same basket. And by managing the correlation, you're able to produce a portfolio that had better returns, lower risk, and therefore over time, would grow into a much larger nest egg than the traditional stock-picking approach. That was a combination of Markowitz and Sharpe and all of the other luminaries that had ultimately taken this academic idea, a rather dry set of mathematics, and really turned it into something practical and genuinely useful.

Benz: Markowitz is rightly credited as the father of Modern Portfolio Theory, but you call him the grandfather of behavioral finance in your book. What do you see as his contribution to this field?

Dr. Lo: Well, if you think about portfolio theory the way he looked at it, he made a behavioral statement. His statement was, individuals, they care about two things: risk and reward. They don't like risk; they do like reward. Those are actually behavioral assumptions. And based upon those behavioral assumptions, he derived tremendously powerful implications about how individuals would ultimately manage their money to achieve those goals. Since then, he's actually spent some time thinking about other criteria, other behavioral approaches. And so, in that respect, I think he really is the very first behavioral economist. He took human behavior seriously and then worked out the implications and ultimately developed a tremendously valuable framework for helping everybody manage their particular behavioral desires. And of course, since then, we've learned that there are many other kinds of behaviors, some of which are conducive, others of which are not, to wealth creation. And there's a lot more research that's being done on that today.

Ptak: I wanted to talk about Bill Sharpe, another luminary who you profile in the book. One of the many big advances that he made was in developing a measure of a security's non-diversifiable risk or beta. Can you talk about how well you think beta has held up through the years? I suppose on one hand, we can say it hasn't held up all that well, because there have been all these other factors that had been developed that now flank traditional beta. And so, in that way, it was an incomplete explanation. But do you think it's stood the test of time when you take a look at the way it contributed to our understanding of markets?

Dr. Lo: I think it's been transformational. And despite the fact that there are many other theories that have been developed that would argue that the traditional beta is insufficient, that there are multiple factors, the bottom line is that Bill Sharpe taught us to think about risk in a very different way from Markowitz. Markowitz said risk is volatility. And what Sharpe said was, ""No, that's not quite right. Risk is the part of volatility that you can't get rid of by diversifying."" And that was a really stunning achievement because it now provided a way for you to think about what investors require on their rate of return, what corporate managers should expect in terms of the cost of capital for doing their capital budgeting and for how performance should be measured based upon the amount of systematic risk that you're taking. So, it was really Sharpe's capital asset pricing model that gave us this distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk and where the rewards would come from, not from idiosyncratic risk, but from bearing systematic risk.

Now, since then, there have been other theories that have been developed to point out, well, there are multiple sources of systematic risk. It's not just market risk, but it's currency risk, credit risk, and so on. All of those are definitely advances from the original model, but it doesn't take away from the insights that Sharpe provided to us. And those insights are still being used to this day. And even though we do have other models with other betas, other sources of systematic risk, the fact is that we still take a look at the most significant source of risk as the market portfolio and that's all Sharpe.

Benz: Sharpe recalled that people were very slow to adapt the capital asset pricing model he developed because, in his words, ""It went against everything people in the investment industry did."" What do you think is today's CAPM, an idea or a model that is so counter to conventional wisdom that it hasn't caught on, but it has the potential to be transformative in the way that Sharpe's theories were?

Dr. Lo: Well, that’s a bit of a loaded question, because I—and I don’t want to seem too self-serving—but some of the work that I’ve been doing on incorporating principles of evolutionary theory to financial markets, I believe that that’s an area where we can make great progress. But I would argue that it certainly has not yet caught on. It’s something that people in the industry have an appreciation for simply because of their own experiences. But I think in academics, we still like to think in terms of formal mathematical models that are immutable and part of the physical law of the financial universe. I think that over time, we’re going to recognize that biology, especially evolutionary biology, is probably a closer approximation to financial market dynamics than physical theories.

Ptak: Since you mentioned it, maybe you can expand a little bit more on the key tenets of the adaptive markets hypothesis, or the AMH for short. You developed it to bridge behavioral and rational finance. I think you may have referenced some of those key tenets. But maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on how it forms that connection between behavioral and rational finance.

Dr. Lo: Well, the beginnings of it are really the ""efficient markets hypothesis"" that Gene Fama pioneered, and it was really a wonderful privilege to be able to include him in our book, too. In addition to being a giant in modern finance, Fama is just an incredibly dynamic and personable individual. So, it was really fun talking with him and understanding the roots of his ideas. So, the efficient markets hypothesis is really the foundation for a lot of the investment innovations that we enjoy today, things like mutual funds, passive versus active investing. And, of course, Jack Bogle credits a lot of what he has done to a combination of Markowitz, Sharpe, and Fama.

The idea behind efficient markets is that prices fully reflect all available information. And as a result, it'd be very hard for anybody to try to beat the market. So, instead of beating the market, may as well join it, meaning invest in a broadly diversified portfolio, and you'll benefit from the growth of the market as opposed to trying to pick the winners and get rid of the losers.

Now, the efficient markets hypothesis has been criticized by a number of behavioral economists. And I think that that's misplaced as well. The efficient markets hypothesis isn't wrong; it's just not complete in the sense that there are periods where efficiency breaks down. For the most part, it's an excellent approximation to most market conditions. Because, in general, markets tend to be very competitive, there are lots of very smart, highly paid people that are engaged in the process of coming up with the very best possible information. And so, it is really hard to generate value for investors in markets by trading, but it's not impossible. And periodically, when there are market dislocations, those who understand how those dislocations occur can take advantage of them and generate better value for their investors.

So, to be able to understand the dynamic of when markets are efficient and when they break down, you need to develop a different approach. And so, this is what I call the adaptive markets hypothesis. It's basically an approach that takes as its starting point the efficient markets hypothesis but then layers on top of it a more discreet and the specific description of investor behavior from the behavioral, psychological, and ultimately, evolutionary biology perspective. If we look at markets as not a physical system that never changes, but if we look at it as an ecosystem consisting of different species that are competing for survival, we see a dynamic that's much closer to reality. And that's really the idea behind adaptive markets. It's to take the principles of evolutionary biology and ecology, things like competition, innovation, and ultimately, adaptation and natural selection, to take those principles and apply them to financial market interactions among the various different stakeholders and use that framework to explain how markets change over time.

Benz: What are the implications for the perfect portfolio? If Fama and the efficient markets hypothesis hadn't come along, how might things have played out differently?

Dr. Lo: Well, I think eventually, somebody would have come up with that idea, because it is such a good and such a compelling idea. That’s true with most scientific discoveries. Obviously, the individuals who are credited with those breakthroughs deserve that credit. They were first. But if they weren’t first, most likely somebody else would have done it. Because the bottom line is that financial markets are highly competitive. And so, prices most of the time do reflect most of the information that’s out there. So, if we hadn’t had that theory at all, I think what we would be doing today is still struggling with the gunslinger kind of culture of investing. We would be trying to find that investment manager that would be able to generate superior returns—the next Warren Buffett, the next George Soros. The problem, of course, is that while many are called, few are chosen—we don’t know who the next genius investor will be. And so, the combination of Markowitz, Sharpe, Fama, Bogle and all of the luminaries, what they gave us is the means to create a very good investment portfolio without being a gunslinger. They essentially democratized finance. They gave finance to the people.

Ptak: We've gone from a single-factor explanation of the relationship between a securities risk and its expected return to a three-factor model. Now, we're up to five-factor models if you go off of Fama and French's five-factor model. It certainly is progress. But I suppose doesn't it also argue for a kind of humility? And, if so, how should that inform conclusions we draw about the best way to forecast risk and return and build a portfolio?

Dr. Lo: Well, if there's one thing that you can be sure of is that financial markets will humble any investor at some point. So, yes, I think that humility is the right word. In fact, if you take a look at the machine-learning algorithms that artificial intelligence experts have applied in other industries, people are now starting to apply those same techniques to financial modeling. And what we're coming up with is not just five factors, but how about 200 different factors. And the issue is that these factors change in importance over time. So, it may well be that there are only four or five factors that are the most relevant right now. But the problem is that those four or five factors are not the same four or five factors that were the most relevant a year ago, and they changed yet again a year before that.

So, what we're seeing today is because of these breakthroughs in AI, and computing, and information technology, we're able to create a much more complex array of factors. And we're going to see that over time, that's going to provide much better rates of return for all investors if they are able to be more flexible and dynamic. The key is whether or not they are able to allow themselves that flexibility, because it's so easy to get into religious convictions about what should work and what shouldn't. So, we do have to approach these issues with a certain degree of humility. But if we do, I think that's really what will ultimately help us to create value for ourselves as well as for our investment clients.

Benz: Fama has also done influential research on agency risk and the way incentives can create mismatches. There's now an entire cottage industry of advisors and consultants who specialize in things like risk management and portfolio construction. And to differentiate, they'll often recommend more complex solutions and techniques. How can clients ward against that risk?

Dr. Lo: Without a doubt, I think the principle of “keep it simple” applies in finance as well as in other endeavors. And there are certain people that love complexity and revel in it. And those are the portfolio managers that make a career out of investing. But for most individuals, they really just want to be able to plan for their retirement and know that they can retire in a lifestyle to which they’ve become accustomed. And for them, “keep it simple” is definitely the right operating principle. I think that this is a bit of a challenge with the various different service providers that you mentioned. But I think that with the right type of advice—and it’s one of the reasons that we wrote the book was to provide investors with a little bit of that in advance so they can be properly prepared.

It is possible now with the various tools that are given to us, we can create some very, very useful investment opportunities, whereas maybe 10 years ago, we would have needed much more hand-holding. It's very much like in any other endeavor, say, personal health. Nowadays, there's just so much information on the Internet about how to deal with hypoglycemia, dealing with obesity, various other kinds of medical challenges, we know to count our calories or watch our cholesterol, make sure we don't consume too many carbs, focus on a keto diet if we're trying to lose weight. So, there's a lot of information today that didn't exist 10 years ago about diet. But that also makes it much more challenging for the individual to figure out what the appropriate type of treatment is for a given condition.

So, in that same spirit, I think we have to be better educated as investors, so that we can manage through all of these various different opportunities and pitfalls. In some cases, having a financial advisor can be quite helpful. But we have to be careful about conflicts of interest. I've often thought that financial advisors ought to be required to swear to a kind of a Hippocratic oath that doctors do: do no harm to your investor, first and foremost. We don't quite do that yet. But I think that we're getting closer to thinking about incorporating those kinds of considerations into the fiduciary responsibilities that financial advisors and portfolio managers have. Over time, I think that that will get much better.

Ptak: You mentioned this idea of simplicity. And who better to talk about next than someone who, as you could argue, was an exemplar for simplicity, Jack Bogle. You were able to interview him before he passed away. Bogle boiled portfolio design down to a few basic ingredients, and you lay this out in the book. They were: reward, risk, time, and cost. Can you talk about this framework? And apart from his achievements in popularizing low-cost investing, what contributions do you think Bogle made toward defining the perfect portfolio?

Dr. Lo: Well, it's hard to overestimate the contributions that Jack Bogle made to the practical investor. I think that he really opened up investing to the entire world through Vanguard. Vanguard provided, at the time, a very, very different alternative to investing than the status quo. The idea of bundling securities, many of which we've never even heard of, into a pool of investments and then investing in that pool was completely radical, and at low cost. His insistence on keeping costs low is just such a remarkable ethic that to this day, I think, affects the Vanguard organization despite his passing.

And Jack often talked about not the efficient markets hypothesis or the adaptive markets hypothesis, he talked about the cost matters hypothesis. A very simple idea, which is that, if you end up paying for expensive advice over time, that’s going to eat away at your investment returns. And so, his notion of pooling a large number of securities benefiting from the correlation diversity that Markowitz talked about decades before and really reducing the risk and increasing the expected return for that kind of passive portfolio that created a multi-trillion-dollar index. But more importantly, it really democratized finance in that everybody—everybody from pharmacist, and the librarian, to the janitor, to the portfolio manager—they can all use his ideas to invest cheaply and effectively in a well-diversified index fund. So, it really is hard to really fully grasp the enormity of his contributions in allowing people to save for their retirement. And he was a champion of keeping it simple, and he put his money where his mouth is by creating the tools to allow us to keep it simple and yet prepare properly for our retirement.

Benz: Well, speaking of that, keeping things simple, Bogle thought it was OK to tie your bond allocation to your age. He frowned on frequent rebalancing, he stuck to investing in U.S. stocks, to name a few of the strategies that he evangelized about. Do you think we overrate techniques that more precisely calibrate the asset mix that we might own or seek to maximize diversification?

Dr. Lo: I do. And it really depends on the context. Someone once said that it's far better to be approximately right than to be precisely wrong. And I think that that applies to a lot of the financial theories that we academics have developed. We revel in the mathematics and statistics that we use. But the bottom line is for the typical retail investor who doesn't have the training or the patience to be able to use any of these ideas, they want to keep it simple. And in order to be able to get them to do the right thing for their retirement portfolio, we really have to keep it simple for them. So, I think that Jack Bogle is exactly right on that point, and the simpler the better.

Now, of course, I need to add Albert Einstein's warning that, when he was criticized at one point for the complexity of his ideas, he replied, “A theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.” And I think that that really bears repeating in the financial realm. There are certainly many things that can be made relatively simple, like diversification, index investing, and so on. But if you're engaging in a much more complicated corporate financial strategy, where you want to manage the risks of a pharmaceutical company, or you want to think about the impact of climate change on certain types of investments and captive assets, well, in that case, you really do need to have more sophisticated tools. So, like what most plumbers and carpenters would say, “You've got to pick the right tool for the right job.” And we just have to make sure that we understand what those tools are to be able to apply them to the appropriate jobs.

Ptak: We're going to talk about Charley Ellis for a moment. It's another leading figure you profile in the book. He's been an unflagging champion of indexing. For all of his accomplishments, what do you see as his biggest contribution to advancing our definition of the perfect portfolio?

Dr. Lo: Well, probably his biggest accomplishment is the creation of Greenwich Associates, which is a consulting firm that helps institutional investors think about investing in a systematic way. For years, Greenwich Associates has been helping pension funds, endowments, foundations, and very large pools of money, think systematically about reducing their costs, about the cost matters hypothesis according to Bogle and thinking about diversification and broadening their exposures not just to U.S. companies, but internationally, and really doing well by their clients who are pension plan participants. So, I think that Ellis' contributions are also enormously important when you take a look at the amount of assets he was able to affect with Greenwich Associates, before that at DLJ, and just a really impressive career.

Benz: Going back to the topic of adaptive markets hypothesis, how would a perfect portfolio designed per the adaptive markets hypothesis differ from what someone in the rational or behavioral finance camps might have come up with?

Dr. Lo: I think the main difference is that it provides an avenue for an individual to change over time as his or her circumstances change. I think back to the days before I had children. And at that point, I had no problem taking all sorts of risks, both financially as well as personally. In fact, I used to ride a motorcycle for a period of time. Once I had kids, that changed completely. I traded in my four-door sedan for a station wagon. I no longer rode the motorcycle. When I rode my bike, I started wearing a helmet. So, as our circumstances change, we change in response. And I think that has to apply to our investment strategies as well. So, I think that's probably the biggest impact of an application of adaptive markets, is to acknowledge that there's a lot of value in what the efficient markets proponents have described in terms of how to manage a portfolio. But there's also value in what the behavioral critics have leveled as critiques against the various different strategies. And so, ultimately, what we want to do is to be able to take the best of both. We want to be not necessarily devoted to any one school of thought but rather opportunistic and engaging in all of the above. And that's really where the adaptive markets hypothesis comes in. It provides the framework for thinking about how to do that and under what conditions does adaptation add value and under what other conditions could it actually hurt value.

Ptak: To build on that, imagine that my main retirement vehicle is my defined-contribution plan, and I dump all my money into a target-date fund that approximates my anticipated retirement date. I think of a target-date fund that probably reflects different rational and behavioral principles, in the way it's constructed and rebalances over time. But then I hear about the adaptive markets hypothesis, and I go to you and I say, ""What should I do differently as I'm approaching retirement than this target-date fund?"" What, if anything, would I need to consider if I were to invest consistent with the adaptive markets framework that you've come up with?

Dr. Lo: Well, the first point to observe is that a target-date fund is not necessarily one-size-fits-all. But it's not that far away. What it says is that maybe five-sizes-fit-all. And that's a problem because for many of us our personal circumstances can be so different from one another that they really don't fit any of the buckets that are designed by a target-date fund. So, the glide path is probably not the sufficient statistic for getting us to think about how to manage our portfolio.

The beauty is that we live in an age where financial technology advanced to such a point that we ought to be able to create personalized indexes in the same way that we have personalized medicine. Medical specialists are now able to craft therapeutics that are designed specifically to your particular DNA. And so, we should be able to do that on the financial side as well. We certainly have the hardware and the software. What we don't yet have are the algorithms that allow us to create that personalized portfolio. But if we could do that, that would actually address a lot of the issues of adaptation, because all of us are going to be adapting in our own personal ways based upon our specific contributions over the years to our portfolio, as well as our specific needs in terms of medical expenses, children, and other investment opportunities. So, I think that that's where we are today. We're at the precipice of being able to really deliver on the promise of financial technology. But we're not there yet.

Benz: You lay out an interesting framework of 16 different investor archetypes that are determined based on four characteristics: risk aversion, income levels, spending level, and economic environment. Can you talk about that and how it can be used to map someone to a portfolio?

Dr. Lo: Well, the inspiration for the archetypes of investors really came from psychology, specifically, Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist, that came up with these various different personality types—introvert, extrovert, sensing, feeling—that kind of categorization. What Steve and I wanted to do was to illustrate both the complexity, as well as the opportunity of thinking about investment preferences. We all know about risk tolerance. That’s something that the SEC has adopted as an important component of considering whether or not a particular investment is suitable for a client. But beyond risk tolerance, there are many other factors. And thinking about whether or not one has the ability to focus, and the time involved, and whether one is at the early stages of saving for retirement or at the later stages, about ready to retire, all of those considerations really gave Steve and I the impetus to create these different archetypes, so that we can show investors there isn’t just risk-tolerant, risk-seeking, or risk-averse investor. It’s really a much more complex landscape of 16. And the hope is that by investors thinking about which archetype they are, they will then be able to approach their choices of investments in a somewhat more sophisticated manner to be able to deal with these kinds of issues.

Ptak: For my last question I wanted to shift a little bit and talk about technology in investing—I should say technology and innovation, one of its applications to investing, which is direct indexing. What’s your take on direct indexing? The potential tax savings seem appealing. But do you think it also could create incentives to overcomplicate portfolio constructions in ways that are ultimately self-defeating?

Dr. Lo: That's certainly a risk that we have to be wary of. And I think this goes back to the point about picking the right tool for the right purpose. For certain individuals, I think that kind of complexity they would enjoy and be completely comfortable with. For other individuals, that would be far more complex and dangerous because they don't understand what they're getting into, and they may not be able to react in the appropriate ways when markets dislocate. So, I think that, like all financial innovation, it has to be tailored for the right circumstance, the right individual, and the right set of purposes. But having said that, I'm a big fan of using these technological tools, because it gives us enormous flexibility and power. Along with power comes great responsibility. So, we have to spend the time and effort to learn on how to use these tools, but once we do, I think that that opens up a much wider landscape of investment opportunities and ways that we can manage the risk that we enter when we start thinking about retirement planning.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar, Inc. Jeff Ptak: And I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services. Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Professor John Lynch, senior associate dean for faculty and research at the Leeds School of Business and University of Colorado distinguished professor. Professor Lynch's research focuses on the cognitive psychology of consumer decision-making, including consumer-financial decision-making. Together with his Leeds School colleagues, he founded the Centre for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making to bring social science to bear on understanding how people save, invest, budget, and take on debt. He has published numerous research papers and has received many awards for his work, including the Society for Consumer Psychology's Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award. Professor Lynch received his BA in Economics, his MA in Psychology and his PhD in Psychology all from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professor Lynch, welcome to The Long View. John Lynch: Thank you so much for having me. Benz: Thanks for being here. We were really compelled by your research on the role of financial education and its ability to help improve financial consumers' decision-making. So, let's talk about that, because it does seem that your research indicates that delivering financial education really doesn't translate necessarily into better consumer behaviors. Lynch: Yes, so we did what's called a meta-analysis, which is a statistical summary of every paper that had been published by that point, as well as unpublished working papers, just to summarize what the data seemed to show. And there is one conclusion that people talk about a lot, which is that if you look across studies where some consumers got financial education, others didn't, on average, getting the education versus not explained 0.001% of variability among people in whether they do the so-called good or bad behaviors. And so the average effect is, it's actually statistically highly significant because there's so much data, but it's a very small effect. And then I guess another thing that's a little bit discouraging is that those effects are even weaker when you look at low-income samples, who I think we're trying especially to help, compared to studies that look at regular general-population samples. I guess the last thing that people cite a lot from this paper is the idea that the effective financial-education decays, which is not surprising—basically all education decays. Benz: So, let's just explain what that means. It means that if I'm not using it, it just goes away, right? Lynch: That's exactly right. So what we did is we did an analysis that looked at studies that varied in the number of contact hours of education, and also varied in the length of time that had passed from the end of the education to when we looked at the effects on behavior. And first of all, the results unsurprisingly showed that if you look at effects on behavior farther out in time, you get less effect. That's not surprising. We also found that if you look at interventions that had more contact hours, they had more effect on consumers' behavior, which is also not surprising. Then the third piece of it that I think is like the most important result in our study is those two things combined or interacted, such that it mattered quite a bit whether you had only an hour versus, say, a 24-hour intervention, if you looked at effects on immediate behavior. But if you scale that out, say a couple of years, it didn't matter whether you had an hour or 24 hours or something even longer. There was no effect when you looked that far out on financial behavior for interventions of any length on average. And so that led us to say that financial education should be narrowly targeted at changing a specific behavior ""just in time."" So, if you want to have influence, you should try to figure out when that behavior is going to happen and try to have your financial-education interventions like right before that. Ptak: Maybe for the benefit of our listeners, since it's so central to your research findings, this notion of sort of good versus bad behavior—maybe to orient them to that framework and how it is you or the researchers whose work you were drawing upon, define that. Can you give maybe an example of a good behavior and contrast that with a bad behavior? Lynch: Yeah, so, first of all, it's a great question, because I think there's almost no behavior that one can say is an unvarnished good, but the behaviors we looked at were behaviors where people take a position that one way of behaving is good, for example, saving. So, do you have…do you save? Have you done any planning for your retirement? What's the state of your debt? How are you at cash flow management? Do you invest? Are you active? If you say you have a 401(k) plan, are you active in your retirement plan? Or are you engaged in what we call inertial behaviors where you just don't pay attention after the fact. And so, across all those behaviors, or all those different types of behavior, what we found was, if you measured people's financial literacy and related it to whether they did those so-called good behaviors, there was a reasonable connection between how many questions you get right, asking questions about basic finance, and whether you did those good behaviors. But for studies that tried to intervene to change those behaviors, those all showed dramatically smaller effects. And so it looks like knowing about financial matters does matter. But the educational interventions to try to improve that and therefore change the behavior are having much weaker effects. Benz: One thing that jumped out at me from your research is that sort of diffuse financial education about a lot of different topics like controlling debt or investing well, or you know, the broad cross section of information that people might have. If they take some sort of financial course. That's inherently not helpful because it's not just in time. Can you expand on that? Lynch: Yeah, so that's my position. I think sometimes I get characterized when people write stories about financial education. I get characterized as having results that are against financial education. But that's a mischaracterization of what we think our results show. So, this just-in-time idea, it's completely unsurprising. It's a general principle of learning that if you learn things and you don't use them, then it decays. So if I teach an advanced statistics class, and people don't use those statistics, it will be gone if you don't use it. And so my critique is that some of the advocates of financial education, they have the intuition that if we could just set you up for a lifetime by telling you everything you need to know, you'd get in these good financial habits, and you'd have a lifetime of financial success. So therefore, you're advocating teaching in schools, actually, both in high school and even elementary school, about this whole array of financial topics. So, you know, not just here's about what a credit card is; here's what a stock is, here's what a bond is, here's what a mortgage is, here's what insurance is, etc. And my contention is that if you want to target your financial education at people that are younger, you have to think about what behaviors are they going to have a chance to engage in, and then figure out how to have a narrowly targeted intervention on just that topic. Because you'll see, for example—I don't know if this is still true, but it was true, for example, in the state of Virginia, when they put in a high school financial-education course, freshman in high school, if I'm not mistaken—and they're truly hoping that you're going to wind up in adulthood and understand about mortgages because you took this class in high school, and it just goes against everything we know about any form of learning. It's nothing special about financial education. You got to use it, or you lose it. Ptak: It seems like the dilemma though, is that to effectively deliver just-in-time education that's really potent in the way you described, it collides with people's tendency to be impulsive, and to maybe make a spontaneous spending decision, perhaps to their detriment. And so can you talk about an example where just-in-time delivery of financial education has been really successful in overcoming kind of that central paradox. Lynch: So, I can give you examples of where I think it would be very timely. Ptak: Sure. Lynch: Let's take the issue of retirement plan leakage. We have another project with researchers at University of British Columbia and Texas State University about retirement plan leakage. And it turns out that when people change jobs, depending on how you look at the statistics, like just under 40%, drain the money in their retirement account when they do that. Benz: They pull it out. Lynch: They pull it out entirely. They pay the taxes on it and they pay the penalties on it. And so you have somebody who was in a job, they had a certain amount of balance. Now they're 35 years old, they change jobs, and they leak it. So, the biggest place where you get this retirement plan leakage is actually a job separation. Well, that'd be a fantastic time to have just-in-time financial education, when you're going into the HR process and you're talking about leaving the organization—to get an intervention that explains to you at that point in time, that it would be a really bad idea to do that; you'd have to have very rare circumstances to make it a good idea. And here are ways that you can roll over; either keep what you have in your current plan or roll it over into another qualified asset. So that's an example where there's a point in time, and we can identify that a consumer is at that point in time, and so we can intervene. I think what is in Jeff's question is that there are some behaviors where it's harder to know when the person is at that point in time. Ptak: Right. Lynch: But then it's hard to act in a practical manner on this advice to have this just-in-time financial education if you don't know that the person's about to engage in a behavior. What do you do about it? And I would say that's a realistic point. What I would favor is if people are interested in financial education to try to look at it on a behavior-by-behavior basis. And say is that a behavior, one: where we can have a signal—somebody can have a signal—that the person is about to engage in this behavior, or have an opportunity to engage in the behavior, and then can we time our information at that time. There are a number of financial decisions that have that characteristic. With the high school kids, are you about to make a decision about where they go to college. If you are going to go to college, are you going to make a decision about where to go to college; how about the funding for that? Those are all things where we can have some general idea that people are about to have an opportunity to make a decision of a certain type. Similarly, with mortgages and so on, there's a signal when somebody is ""in the market."" So, I do believe that trying to think in a very rigorous way about what are the specific behaviors, and let's try to equip people for those specific behaviors. And let's try to understand the whole context of their decision process. Benz: So a related question to Jeff's—in addition to people being impulsive is that there aren't always benevolent actors in the mix in terms of these financial transactions. So, like the workplace plan, that would be an example of someone who wants to have the participant have a good outcome presumably. But there might be other transactions, like you're ready to take out a mortgage, where there are entities who don't necessarily have the consumer's best interest at heart. So, what do you do about that in terms of putting in place interventions at junctures like that? Lynch: That's a really great, that's a really great question. Because let's take the case of a mortgage, you can imagine that if there's some signal that somebody is in the market, you could provide just-in-time financial education. In fact, we had a project that we worked on for a long time trying to do something in collaboration with one of the GSEs about creating a mortgage-recommender system that would help you understand that, given what you tell me about your personal circumstance, if you took out a loan of this type of this amount, by our statistical model, here's your likelihood of defaulting, etc. And then if you change from adjustable rate to a fixed, then here's how our model says you have a less likelihood of default etc. And it never came to fruition. And one of the reasons it didn't come to fruition is the point that Christine is making, that you've got actors in the system who don't have an incentive to want you to limit the amount of money that you borrow. You know, if your commission is based on the total amount, then why would I want to tell you that you should borrow anything less than the total amount that someone will lend you. So, I do think that that is another serious issue. I am on the Academic Research Council of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and they have a very strong group there working on financial-education issues. And a lot of the things that they are trying to address are exactly the questions that you guys are asking about. Well, how do you know about the timing? How do you deal with the fact that you're in a market where you're not the only voice with the recommendation? Benz: Well, you mentioned the CFPB. I wanted to talk about that because I think there's been sort of this widespread perception that things have really changed there, that perhaps its mission has changed. What's your perspective on that from having served on that board? Lynch: You know, I just attended a meeting of the Academic Research Council in October in DC and I was pleasantly surprised. I did have some concerns. If you go from when Cordray was director and then they had Mulvaney was director. It did appear he was like trying to close down the CFPB and, you know, make them change their name and all sorts of things. So, I would just say I'm guardedly optimistic this meeting with the new director Kraninger really seemed to be a very open conversation. And so I actually think that I'm pretty optimistic. And I know a lot of people that are working there in the research group who I have a lot of regard for. Benz: So, going back to the just-in-time concept, can you talk about any implementations of that that you've seen that have been promising to you? Are you seeing this get implemented in a real-world setting? Lynch: The conversations that I have, for example, when I met with the Financial Education Group of the CFPB it was more how they're trying to think of applying it rather than my saying, look, they read our paper, they change their practices based on the paper, and here's the result. I don't have that I can just describe to you as I have, how they're trying to think about their different groups and what is realistic and what is not. And I guess the other that I consider to be a success is they're backing off from efforts that I think would be doomed to be impractical. So, for example, if they still have a group that's directing their efforts at younger kids. But instead of thinking they're going to teach these kids about compound interest, and here's what a bond is. Instead, they're trying to teach them more general skills that they believe are related to good financial behavior, like issues of self-control, like planning, like grid, etc. And there are things that are skills that extend beyond money. So, I personally view that to be the success of our paper that we're influencing people to back off from things that seem like they will be doomed to failure from anything I know about cognitive psychology and memory and learning. Ptak: And what gives you confidence that imparting those sorts of more-generalized lessons you describe work better than some of the other lessons that perhaps they were originally trying to impart but which you thought had much lower odds of succeeding? Lynch: That is a good question. I mean, in some cases, it's like basic math skills. You know, that's an example of a general thing they're doing which I think is a positive. There are some things about money that are just about math. It's a good idea to teach kids about math. On the issue of when you get to things that are about planning and self-control, there is a little bit of experimental stuff on that, but not anything that I know of its large-scale field experiments. So again, it's pretty experimental. I guess, a piece of what I have said about this is like, when we wrote this first paper, and we say that look, you know, from the things that are published, 0.001% of the variability among people, and whether they do the good or bad behavior is explained by whether they got the intervention. It was not a statement that we thought that it was not possible to do something beneficial. Rather, it was that what people have tried so far isn't working, or is not working the way they think it's working, because people are too easily convinced by anecdotes. So, we suggested to them, they have to be a lot more evidence based. And one of the things about being more evidence based is being more careful about observing when one does run a study, being more careful about documenting in the study exactly what happened in the education, what are the details of the curriculum, etc. And then sort of careful measurement of those outcomes. Because I believe you can't do this by like intuition or what you think is ""common sense."" It requires an accumulation of evidence from different studies and saying, OK, these studies differ from these in a particular way, and that seems to be associated with this improved outcome. So, I'm a believer, I don't think that anything that we've written will ever have the effect of reducing enthusiasm for financial education because people seem super wedded to it. But my thought is, how to make it as beneficial as possible. And I think that anybody who's doing it should have a view that it's very provisional, very experimental; be very careful to actually test to be able to assess whether something did work or not and make that available in ways that it can be accumulated. Benz: So, in terms of teaching financial education in a classroom setting, it sounds like you think it calls for sort of a fundamental rethinking of what we're doing there. How about for parents who are trying to inculcate, some good financial habits in their kids. Are there things that they should think about that maybe you could use your research to sort of influence? Lynch: Yeah. So, I would say yes, and I'm going to say yes for a couple different reasons. But it's going to be a provisional, yes. The reason my yes is provisional, is because the question presumes the parents know what they're talking about. And part of the problem, I think, or we think, about financial education is it's very related to you know, Jeff's question about other actors. The teacher could do a great job in some formal financial-education setting, teaching some topic about money matters, and the kid goes home, and mom and dad or aunt and uncle, and every family friend has opinions about money—you know, they're often wrong. And so parents can help their kids a lot if they know what they're talking about. Then the second thing I would say, is I have another paper that is kind of a counterpoint to this just-in-time idea. One of the arguments, it's actually very related to Jeff's question. If you decide you're not going to give people financial education until you're sure they need it. What if by that point, it's too late, you know, like either you missed the opportunity for the behavior or they just can't assimilate it. And so you often hear when this research is discussed, this idea that well, you may not be able to show effects of this early school age financial education on behavior, but you set a foundation that will be helpful later in life. And my answer to that is, again, is this use it or lose it. We have a study—it's not a paper on financial education—but we have a paper with Adrian Ward at University of Texas at Austin, about financial literacy of couples. And actually, I think I might have talked about that on Morningstar forum. Benz: Yes. Lynch: And that is relevant in this context, because what we show in that is that when couples first get together, they divide up various tasks that you know, things that couples need to divide up, one of which is money. And we find that when couples start their relationships, there's no association between people's measurable financial knowledge and who gets the job as what we call the household CFO or Chief Financial Officer. So, when you start out, if you wind up with a money job, it's not because you know more about money. It's not that you had a better credit score or any other record that you're actually are better with money. It looks like maybe if you want the job, you're more likely to get it. But it's not that you know more. But as couples progress in their relationship, the longer they're together, the more they start diverging in what they know. And the one who's the CFO, household CFO, gets better and better and better over time and what they know about money. It's learning by doing. And the person who's in the non-CFO role remains flat if they're unengaged or can actually decline over time. And it gets to the point that if you're—this is going to discredit everything I've said—but in my family, my wife handles all the money, and so we've been together for 45 years now. What our research shows is that couples like us, by the time we've been together for a very long time, there's a wide divergence in knowledge between the one who's doing the money and the one who's not. And if you now, 45 years in, you ask the one person who hasn't been doing the money to make independent financial decisions—they're much worse than the financial decisions of their partner, where that wouldn't have been true at the beginning when they had the same knowledge base. And so all that's a long windup to say, you know, if I scale the same principles to the issue of financial education in high school…because I think one of the problems with high school financial education is that kids tune it out, because they don't think they're going to use it. Well, now if you're a parent, you might have a way that you know the kid can use it in the way you've arranged things in your family, like the kid may have an allowance or they may have a job or something like that. You are in a position to allow the kid to act on what he or she is learning. And to me, that's the critical thing that all the learning literature suggests will prevent decay. It's if you're using it, then there's a chance that it's going to persist. The problem is if you learn it—you taught me about a mortgage when I'm in high school, what the heck, you know, it's not surprising that there's not a lot left by the time the kid gets out of high school, much less college, much less when they're actually buying a home a decade later. So, a knowledgeable parent can be very thoughtful. And so if a parent listening to this podcast is discouraged about what's being said about what can be done in the school, if the parent knows his or her stuff, or the parents know their stuff, they can do things and they can help the kids learn good money habits that they'll act on. And I'm optimistic about that. Benz: So, I wanted to go back to that research about couples and financial decision-making and kind of that divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of couples use from a practical standpoint. Let's just talk about the downside then of one couple having honed his or her abilities over the years and the other one just sort of letting that decay go on. Why is that bad? Seems pretty obvious, but I just like to cover potential downside. Lynch: Yeah, I'll say well, it turns out, it's really good. It can be good up to a certain point in time and then it turns bad. So interestingly, in our research, we find that when we have from these national surveys that measuring the objective financial outcomes of households, there is a pretty decent relationship between the measurable financial knowledge of the person in the household responding if that person is the Chief Financial Officer for the household. So how much they know and the financial outcomes for the household are related. There's no relationship between the financial knowledge of a respondent and the outcomes for that household if that person's not the Chief Financial Officer, which is to say that if I wanted to be totally ignorant, then as long as my wife knows what she's talking about, and we're together, we're good to go. The problem is depressingly, like every relationship ends in either dissolution of the relationship or death of one of the partners. And if you've had this apparently functional relationship where the partner is handling everything, and then suddenly you don't have that partner to rely on, you're in a pretty tough spot. Not only do you not know how to do things well on your own, our research shows that you have a harder time like restarting and accumulating because you don't have that base of knowledge that actually does help you learn more. So, you're in a tough spot. By the way, you may not be able to tell, like who to turn to. Do you turn to a family member? Does that family member know what he or she is talking about? And do they have your best interests at heart? Do you turn to a financial advisor? Are you able to discriminate between a financial advisor who actually has your interest in heart versus one who's going to fleece you? So, I actually think this is a major policy issue, that it's natural that couples have this division financial responsibility, and that they're going to differ later in life and how much they know. But the partner who's been relying on the one who's the money expert is in a position of vulnerability. And I think both the financial-services industry and policymakers have to be seriously concerned about that issue. And I would just say—I'll put in a plug—we run what we consider to be the world's best research conference about consumer-finance decision-making, and our keynote topic for this coming year is about the aging consumer and financial decisions of the aging consumer. Those are really significant issues for a lot of people. Ptak: I also wanted to talk about the idea of nudges. So I suppose a way to think about that is, you know, maybe you forego education and you just opt somebody into something; you make the decision for them in a sense. I suppose you could sort of frame that is that type of choice, though, maybe it's not quite that stark. But have you and your colleagues and others in the field had an opportunity to think about, where perhaps it's best to forego a certain amount of education altogether. And then, maybe opt someone into a decision or nudge them in a certain direction, because we know that education just is going to fall short of getting them to where they need to be? Lynch: Yeah, that's another great question. So yeah, so I've been at the University of Colorado now for a decade and when I came here, that was kind of like the big tension was between the ""financial education camp and the nudge camp."" And the key issue with nudging is whether consumers are homogeneous or heterogeneous, and whether it's pretty easy to identify a behavior that's right for most people, or whether you and I might have different behaviors that are ideal for each of us. And so our position in the work that we've done is, if it's something where it's pretty clear what's best for most people—a classic example is the research on organ donation that many people may be familiar with, where you have to check a box to say you opt into being an organ donor versus check a box to opt out, has these huge dramatic effects on whether people are organ donors, in a world where most people agree that we should be organ donors. So that's a case where people agree on what the right behavior is, and you can nudge people into a behavior that there's pretty wide agreement on. The issue is in financial behavior it's not always quite so easy, which is earlier in the interview, I alluded to this work that we had tried to do on these mortgage-recommender systems. The idea of that was that well, you could have somebody who has a different ideal behavior than another person. And a recommender system is a form of a nudge. Some people talk about what they call smart defaults. A smart default is a nudge and a default that captures something about what makes you different from me. The classic example on that is a target-date retirement fund, right? If you think that the main statistic that dictates whether we should have similar or different preferences in how we're investing in retirement funds. Target-date funds says, oh well, depending on how far you are away from retirement, if you're closer to retirement, we should scale down your exposure to stocks. If the differences among people cannot be captured so readily by some single statistic like, how many years till retirement. Those are the cases where I think, you know, if you can't count on somebody to know what's best for you, then you got to know for yourself. So, my view and I would say, our view, and I'm speaking for my co-authors at University of Virginia and Katholieke University in this financial-education area. Our view is that it's those cases where the financial education is best focused. So if you can't be sure what's best for an employee, for example, well, then you should try to have financial education but in the form of what we call a recommender system, like to help them sort through what they say their priorities are, here's a way to easily find that. Benz: So, your research seems to indicate that rules of thumb for financial decision-making can be effective in terms of improving decision-making and behaviors. So why do you think they might work? And what are some examples of rules of thumb that could help instill better behaviors? Lynch: Well, rules of thumb are especially ... well, let's give an example rule of thumb. A rule of thumb might be: contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match; don't leave money on the table. Like it's a pretty easy rule of thumb. I guess there's a risk that somebody might have contributed beyond that. That rule of thumb, you know, seems like very good advice. Somebody who doesn't contribute up to the match seems like they're making a mistake. You may have other rules of thumb when you're teaching younger people about: pay your credit cards off at the end of the month; you know, don't spend money that you don't have. So those are things where you can get people to argue with you. But those rules of thumb are pretty good. And I guess that you've actually, once again, asked another really good question. In our view, if we go back to, what should you be trying to impart both to adults, but also to younger people, the things that make someone have a successful versus less-successful financial life are largely not that complicated. It's not, something about their understanding about compound interest and bonds. It's basic stuff like don't spend money you don't have or those kinds of examples I've been talking about—contribute up to the employer match. So those can be good, and there's a lot of analogies in other domains that show that even though that's not like the 100% solution, for the person who's most sophisticated, it's a darn good solution. An example would be in food consumption. Take your plate and fill it up to the inner circle; don't go outside the inner circle as a portion amount. That's an example of a rule of thumb. And it's easy to argue with it and say, well, there are cases where it should be less or more. But it's not a bad rule. And I think that idea of rules of thumb is a very good line of thinking for both firms and for researchers who are trying to help consumers. Ptak: One of the things that you mentioned a little bit earlier in our conversation is that your research found some differences in I guess the efficacy of financial education depending on perhaps their social and financial circumstances. I think that you referenced the fact that, you know, there were some differences that you observed among lower-income individuals. And so I wonder if maybe you can expand briefly on that and explain why that's so and what, if anything, we can learn from that so that's better addressed going forward? Lynch: Yeah, so there's a financial-education industry. And my view is that people in that industry like are very sincere in their beliefs, but there's an ideology about financial education that it's this great leveler. And the data don't support that. The data show instead that whether you're talking about correlational studies that correlate a measure of financial literacy or financial behavior, or intervention studies where one group gets the financial education, one not, or it's a prepost design where you compare the behavior before or after the financial education. Our data show that in both cases, the effects are a little bit weaker, actually significantly weaker, for the lower-income samples. So, it's not true that it's a great leveler at all. Unfortunately, it's harder to help people who need help more. And so the data don't really suggest that it has that leveling effect. Ptak: And why is that? Lynch: I think that you can have a lot of different speculation. One thing is what we just talked about earlier about the fact that you can get financial education, you go home, and then what happens? Does somebody contradict you, or do they say the same thing, and so on. I gave the example of my teaching people that advanced statistical course and experimental design. It's not like people go home, and somebody tells him to do it a different way than the way I taught. You know, they don't go to a cocktail party and have Uncle Vic say, you know, do it different. But with money, that's not the case. And when you ask the question about what parents can do, the conjecture is that parents of lower-income families have less advantages and less sophistication in what they know about money. So, I would imagine that that part of it is a piece of it. In general, there's something in learning called the enrichment hypothesis, which is that knowledge makes it easier to gain more knowledge, which is the same thing we talked about in the research on couples. And so if low-income kids have less baseline then it just turns out that what you try to do to help them has even less effect than it has on the kids that are more of the middle-class kids. Benz: So which parts of the consumer financial decision-making process are the most worrisome to you today? Are you seeing another crisis in the making anywhere? Whether with auto loans or student loans, retirement decumulation, which you referenced, anything like that? Lynch: Yeah. Let's take the student loan one. So, I mentioned that we run this annual conference, we always pick some key topic. We had Richard Cordray who was the director of the CFPB, we had this fantastic keynote panel about the growing student-loan crisis. And here's an example of a rule of thumb as a way to try to address a problem like a student-loan crisis. It turns out that if you look nationally at flagship state universities, like the one where I teach, out of kids who enter as freshmen, 35% or 36% graduate in four years. It's gotten to the point that universities keep statistics about six-year graduation rate rather than four-year graduation rate. There's a terrific white paper called ""The Four-Year Myth"" that examines this and examines what things both students and universities are doing to make this happen. That's an example of something that it's in my opinion of crisis level. There's one thing that could be done that'll make that a lot better. Like if you're in college for five years, rather than four, then that's an extra year of education. A year that you're out of the workforce has a big financial effect on what your debt burden is going to be. And so, like, that's an example of just-in-time financial education. I think that when they bring kids on campus for these orientations, they should be talking about this with the kids and the parents that should be totally your goal how you are going to get through in four years. And by the way, organizations like mine should care about it. And they should be laser-focused on what bottlenecks in the system would make a kid wind up having to take five years instead of four. So, the student loan crisis is a big one. And again, I think there are things we've been talking about that can help. Retirement-plan savings in my view is another big one that's just a looming crisis level. If you just look at the median level of savings, at least 401(k) savings of people that are in the 55- to 64-year-old range I've seen a statistic at Vanguard that the median balance was something on the order of like $62,000, and you're sitting there that close to retirement. So those are areas where there are problems and I've also talked about solutions in the same interview, like the problem of retirement-plan balances being so low. Well, if something on the order of $0.35 to $0.40 on $1 that's put into a retirement plan leaks out, mostly a job separation. And there are things that we could do as a country about that, I think that should be addressed. Ptak: What about with respect to, and I don't know if this is a facet of your research or not, if not, feel free, and we can move on to the next question. But healthcare is a topic that we've returned to often on this podcast because it is so consequential and also because it's in many respects so unpredictable. And so I guess, are there any best practices that you could share on how one can educate themselves properly to prepare for that quandary that they'll face and managing healthcare expenses at the different junctures, or is that not an area that your research has focused on to this point? Lynch: I am actually just starting to try to do some research on the inner linkages between health and financial domain. We did have actually in this Boulder summer conference on consumer-financial decision-making, last year's keynote topic was about consumers' decisions around healthcare, and what are domains where people are really vulnerable. You know, one of the things that we have this amazing—I mean two amazing speakers—but one of them is a guy named Peter Ubel, who is at Duke University and is an MD, and quite an accomplished behavioral economist. And a lot of his work is just about how the system does not give people information about what they're spending on healthcare. Just as a concrete example, he gave an example of somebody who's a cancer patient, saying like, the doctors don't know what you and I are going to be charged. They don't think it's their job to have to know—everybody's got a different insurance system; how could they possibly know? And the result is the doctor's advice is utterly insensitive to the financial costs on the consumer. His example of this cancer patient, had a choice of treatments in the early round and picked one that happened to be dramatically more expensive, wiped out his savings, and therefore couldn't afford to try when the first treatment didn't work, couldn't afford to try the second thing. The doctors don't know. So, in my view, when we talk about financial education around health, a lot of that should be directed at the healthcare system and the providers who are thinking only Hippocratic Oath. But actually, they give advice that's almost universally followed by the patients. So, if I were putting policy effort into how to help consumers around decisions around health. How can they possibly make good financial decisions if they're going to their doctors and their doctors don't know the price tag. Benz: Speaking of health, you have done some work on the topic of financial well-being. And I'd like to talk a little bit about that. It's obviously so intertwined with our overall sense of well-being if we feel that we have some financial wherewithal. Can you talk about the research that you've done in that area? And also, maybe just define what you think is financial well-being? Lynch: OK. Thanks for that question. Yeah. So, it actually, again relates to our earlier line of discussion when you were asking me well, how do you know that a behavior is a good or bad financial behavior? And some policymakers have taken that question to be serious and difficult and have decided that we're going to instead judge whether an intervention is successful or not, not by whether it changed somebody's specific behavior by whether it makes people feel a higher sense of financial well-being. So, we have done work on this. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done work in measuring this. So, there's a very large literature in psychology, economics, a whole array of sciences, about overall personal well-being. And there's sub-literatures about how your overall well-being relates to things like how do you feel about your job? How do you feel about your personal relationships and so on? And now we're starting to have this literature about financial well-being. So, we worked on both front to conceptualize what this is and developing a measure of it. And broadly, we see these two different dimensions of financial well-being. One is the absence of current money-management stress. That is, you're not sitting here right now and just worried about how you're going to make it through the month. And the second is a sense of long-term future financial security. And what we find is that these measures of financial well-being are strongly related to overall well-being at a level that's actually quite high in magnitude compared to how you feel about your jobs, your personal relationship, etc. It's a big deal. And we further find that those two dimensions I mentioned—feeling free of current money-management stress, and having a sense of long-term financial security. That the weights on those two depend on your income. There's a big literature about income and overall well-being that makes the claim that income matters a lot when you're at very low levels of income. But pretty quickly, once you get to middle class, more income doesn't really change your overall well-being. But what we find is kind of a twist on that standard finding. What we find is that this sense of whether you're stressed, has a pretty big effect if you're lower in income. And as you get to be higher in income, whether you feel that way stress or not, on a monthly basis doesn't have as big an effect on your overall sense of your well-being as a person. The long-term sense of future financial security that turns out to matter—no matter how much money you make, no matter what your other personal circumstances are. And so, you know, we think that's a really interesting area for employers to think about how they can improve the lives of their employee. What can you do as an employer to either help people deal with their current money-management stress or to have them have a greater sense of personal financial security. And just to give a factoid for your audience, these CFPB statistics, its Consumer Financial Protection Bureau statistics, show this shockingly high percent of American consumers have received a call from a debt collector in the last year. So, the numbers around a third of Americans got a debt-collection call. Well, if you're getting debt-collection calls, you got problems that current money management stress, and I think that employers are probably pretty ignorant to the fact this is going on with their employee base. And can think about things that might be done to redress that. Benz: What would be an example of that? Lynch: One of the main issues is around emergency savings. When I earlier alluded to this finding of retirement-plan leakage—part of the problem is that people don't make a mental separation between what's an emergency fund available in an emergency and something that should be untouchable. And so first of all, most people don't have emergency savings. I'm sure your listeners have heard the statistics about what fraction of people can come up with, you know, $400 to be able to without having to go into some really unusual route. Well, there is a movement afoot to try to have employers support having their employees have an emergency-savings fund, and even to contribute, have some matching dollars even around an emergency-savings fund. And if that were the case, that would, obviously a big help in this issue of this current financial stress. Many retirement plans have a loan feature that you can borrow from your retirement plan. And that, in a sense that's like an alternative to the payday loan industry that you can, if you could borrow from your retirement plan, you're really borrowing from yourself. So, doesn't that sound like an emergency savings. But we have some data that suggests that if people think about their retirement plan as the place to go for emergency savings, it gets people thinking that that's a reasonable source to raid when you change jobs. So, I believe that will be very meaningful for employers to look at systematic efforts to encourage their employees to have an emergency savings first, even before they start worrying about the retirement plan. And also to examine the possibility of employer matching on emergency savings. Benz: Well Professor Lynch, this has been a great conversation.

Transcript

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I'm Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Steve Chen. Steve is the founder and CEO of NewRetirement.com, which he describes as a TurboTax for financial planning. NewRetirement advisors also offer one-on-one financial advice and coaching with certified financial planners. Prior to founding NewRetirement, Steve founded venture-backed companies in education and financial services and worked as a consultant at firms including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Dimensional Fund Advisors. He also hosts the NewRetirement podcast and contributes to Forbes. Steve received his Bachelor of Science in systems engineering from Boston University.

Steve, welcome to The Long View.

Steve Chen: Christine, thanks for having me on. It's an honor to be here.

Benz: Well, it's great to have you here. We want to talk about NewRetirement, which is a platform for retirement planning. So, let's talk about how you started it and why you started it. It sounds like you and your brother were trying to help your mom figure out her plan for retirement. Can you talk about that journey and the areas where you found that conventional retirement planning tools came up short?

Chen: Sure. I'd love to share the story. So, my mom came to my brother and I in her early 60s. She had been a small-business owner, a college-educated person. And she was making that transition to retirement. And she had an urgent need, which was, she had started during an economic downturn to use credit cards to subsidize her life. And she needed to borrow $10,000. And so, my brother and I were like, ""Fine, we can write you a check, but we'd really love to understand what's going on here so we don't have to be in the business of writing checks every year and we're building our own families and careers."" And so, luckily, she was open to that idea.

And so, first, we want to outsource this problem. We looked around and we tried to find financial advisors that understood that transition to retirement and understood decumulation. And we couldn't really find people that were experts at this. Most people were focused on accumulation. So, we started doing it ourselves. And we quickly realized, it started with spending and expenses and savings. We were doing this on spreadsheets. And we ended up making a series of changes with her, and this occurred over a multiyear period and continues to this day. But basically, we were looking at her costs, and we were like, you and your partner live in a 5,000-square-foot house on 10 acres of land kind of farther out in the country. The carrying costs, heating oil--this is in upstate New York--are high, the maintenance costs are high. Do you need this much space? And so, we ended up helping her downsize. That created some liquidity for her, which we then looked at how to invest better, and also kept some aside, so she could just be comfortable that she had an emergency fund.

We ended up doing this and then realizing that it's a very complicated problem. And so, we decided that, hey, there's probably an opportunity here, because we looked at the data--there's 75 million baby boomers, there's 120 million people over the age of 50 in this country. They actually control most of the money, but many of them still have a lot of needs around how to think about retirement and how to plan for their future. And we had previous to this built a company around the transition to higher education. So, we in the first dotcom go-around built a company called Embark that was about college search, inquiries, applications. We put the whole process online. And in doing that, we said, OK, this could be that for retirement. We could build a platform that helps people get educated, figure out what's possible, make good decisions, and at least get started on their own. So, that's why we built this business.

Ptak: What do you see as the key pain points in the retirement planning process?

Chen: A great question, Jeff. So, first, I would say, it's getting started. Many people call this an urgent should versus an urgent need. Although it becomes an urgent need once you hit 55 or 60, you kind of realize, hey, there's an endpoint to my traditional career. I'm not always going to be able to make money from working and my human capital. How can I make my assets last and support my lifestyle needs? So, I think getting started is one.

I think also reframing and focusing on income versus assets. So, most of financial services has trained the retail investor to focus on building wealth. And I think that's partly because that's mostly how people are paid as a percent of assets or on transaction fees. I did a podcast with Bob Merton, the Nobel Prize winner. And he said, the whole problem is that everyone is focused on assets versus income, and you need to really think more like pension managers and how do you deliver lifetime income. So, we try to help people do that on our platform, see it both ways.

I would say making it a habit. So, don't think of planning as a one and done. But think of it as a lifetime exercise. And you should revisit your plan at least annually, and potentially quarterly, depending on how quickly things are changing in your life. And think about it holistically. So, don't just think about your assets, but think about how you want to work, how you're going to take care of your spouse, how are you going to pay for healthcare, where are you going to live, what you think your expenses are going to look like. So, I think those are some of the big pain points.

And I would say the last bit is behavior and your own biases. So, I would say that's the biggest challenge we see. People have a very hard time understanding their own biases. And you see that reflected in the data where retail investors traditionally get terrible results from a returns perspective, because they tend to buy when things are expensive, and they tend to sell when things are bad. They just can't control their emotional response. That is actually one of the biggest benefits of having a financial advisor is they do coach you and talk you off the cliff. So, when the market corrects 30%, like it did in March of 2020 with a pandemic, they're like, “Hey, don't sell now or try not to sell now; in fact, even better, invest now.” But it's very hard for individuals to do it on their own.

Benz: Well, I wanted to ask about that, Steve, because your solution has a high digital component, a heavy digital component. So, is there a substitute for that human piece at market inflection points, like the one you just described?

Chen: I don't think people are getting out of this equation anytime soon. People like to talk to other people; they develop trust with people. I do think that there's a huge place for using technology to educate folks and just scale how this can be delivered and help onboard many more people, to the idea that planning has a huge value. And so, we've tried to, like on our platform, we try to enable three paths. There's do it yourself. You can come in and use it like TurboTax, and just build your own plan and manage it all yourself. That's kind of where we started, and we have a lot of power users that, frankly, are super sophisticated, almost as sophisticated as many of the financial advisors we talk to. But we also have another path that's coaching and classes. So, you can do it with groups, or you can do it with coaches that will talk to you and help educate you on the platform but they're not delivering advice. And then, the third path would be one-on-one with a CFP, where you get a personal CFP to help you, either someone on our team or one of our partners that buys into the methodology that we're pursuing.

Ptak: It seems that one of the best arguments for having a human financial advisor is cognitive decline. Even a very successful do-it-yourself investor may not be able to manage his or her financial plan at some point. How do you think about that with respect to NewRetirement since your core offering is very much geared toward people doing this on their own?

Chen: I think that's a great question. And I think it's a very real risk as people age. We do get users coming to us and saying, ""My main thing is, I want to make sure my spouse is taken care of when I pass and making sure that I have a trusted relationship."" So, it's something that we're working toward. I think a financial advisor that is a fiduciary and has proven that they're always going to act in your best interests can deliver a lot of value. At a certain point we all age, we all pass away. It's very likely that many of us will encounter a cognitive decline. And I think there's some different ways to approach this.

So, one is with an individual advisor. Another would be almost creating like a board of advisors that could include your family and financial advisor and maybe third-party services that would help you help make sure they provide almost like a check and balance. Because when you look at elder care or elder abuse, a lot of it actually comes from family and trusted people that take advantage of people that are essentially experiencing some cognitive decline and their decision-making is impaired. So, it is a real issue. I think it's going to evolve a lot in the coming decades as we see these big cohorts of people, the boomers, specifically, who have a ton of wealth deeper into their life cycles.

Benz: Helping simplify the retirement decumulation process is the holy grail for much of the financial-services industry. And there are a lot of very well-funded financial-service providers toiling in this space. So, how do you compete against them? What do you view as your differentiators with the products and services that you offer?

Chen: I think first it starts with--we've created a business model that aligns us with our users. So, we're doing something that's very different for most people in the financial services, which is, we're asking our users to pay us directly. So, we get paid either via a subscription fee, $6 a month now for the software, or on an hourly basis--time and materials for coaching or a CFP. We don't have an AUM fee. We're not managing assets. We're just providing guidance, or if you decide that you want advice through a CFP advice. So, I think it starts with that.

We try to be very transparent. We've done a ground-up build of this technology and platform, and we're doing it at a much lower cost basis. So, our team is small. We're 20 people. We have raised very little money. We have competitors that have raised tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. But by keeping a really low-cost basis, I think, it gives us a lot more latitude. I look at Vanguard and what they do and how they actually organize themselves. So, Jack Bogle, he neutralized the company, and he key aligned his business with his investors. He gave up billions of dollars personally doing that. But because he did that, I think their users see it, and then they're ending up winning. Look at the movement of assets to Vanguard, specifically, through the whole passive movement, you'll see that people see the importance of that business model. And even today, when they run their company, I've seen them at trade shows, they look like they're a startup. They've got these booths that aren't super fantastic, nothing super glitzy, but it's because they're not spending a ton of money on marketing; they're trying to save those dollars and return it to their investors through low fees.

And I'd say the last bit is technology and the community. So, we really try to learn with our community. We try to build that into the platform. Decumulation that we focus on is much more complicated than accumulation. There are a lot of moving parts. So, we're dealing with federal taxes, state taxes. We have people coming on and saying, “I'm a teacher in New York State and my pension works like this: it's taxable federally but not on the state side, and I don't get Social Security.” And so, we try to learn with our users, build that into the platform so it works for everybody else. And because it's software, we can charge super low fees, and we're delivering on that.

Ptak: Getting a clear read on the health of someone's retirement plan requires them to come up with a lot of data about how much they have in assets, how much they hold in various silos, what Social Security will pay them and so on. How have you attempted to reduce the pain, the burden of that data entry process?

Chen: We did something that probably is unusual for a fintech company. We actually started with just letting users enter their own data. Our hypothesis was that people at a high level, first they want to get a big picture. And our belief was, they know what they have, like, I've got roughly $0.5 million in my 401(k), I've got $300,000 in taxable accounts, I have a pension, it's going to be like this, I think about Social Security this way. So, we let them start at a really high level. It's almost like paint by numbers--lay out the big picture for yourself and build trust through showing them that we're adding value. We've now added linked accounts. So, that's another way that we try to make it easier for folks. And more and more people are doing that. And I think when we look forward, there's some innovative companies in the fintech space that are pulling in data through tax returns. We're also talking to some employers now and, we could interface with their HR and payroll systems and their recordkeeping systems to load up thousands of users at a time and pre-create accounts. So, those are some of the ways that we're trying to do it. And I think a lot of it's also just design and UX, just trying to make it simple to use and understand and that's an ongoing effort. We've done a lot of work recently and there's more coming to really simplify how it works. Meet people where they are and let them update it when they want and give them the control.

Benz: I wanted to talk a little bit about how the pandemic has affected retirement planning. You recently wrote a piece in Forbes about how older adults have lost their job at a higher rate than the general population. First, can you talk generally about why this is happening? And second, if someone is in this position where they've lost their job after age, say, 55, what steps should they take to make a save of their plan?

Chen: I read Kerry Hannon's article recently, where she was talking about how 4 million people have been forced into early retirement. I think it's very real. I mean, we are definitely seeing an organic uptick in visitors. And many people in our community are talking about this. And also, Christine, I read your recent article about what COVID means for the future of financial planning, which I thought was great. And I agree with you. I think having an emergency fund and making sure it's well-supplied, thinking hard about healthcare and realizing--there's really three stages of healthcare for people--there's, when you're working and your company provides it. There's usually a transition period between when you stop working and when Medicare starts. And that can get very expensive. And very often, you're going through the ACA to get healthcare, because it's not simple to get. But you could be looking at $1,200 a month or something like that easily. And then, the last bit is when you're on Medicare. And even when you're on Medicare, there's a number of choices you have to make when you start it and also annually you might be changing your plans around if you have a Medicare supplemental plan.

I think that people should anticipate that COVID has brought massive changes to our economy. Remote work and being able to work from anywhere is creating opportunities as well. So, we're seeing more and more people that are moving. They're moving to lower-cost-of-living areas to try and capture that. I think another thing is, scenarios. Our platform supports people creating scenarios. So, what happens if I had to retire now? What does that look like if I'm 55 and I thought I was going to work till 62? Or what happens if I retire at 60? What happens if I move from a high-tax state to a low-tax state? How does that affect my forecast? So, we try to make that easy, help people also get imaginative about what they could do and what's possible. Should I move to Mexico for seven years, and try and live there when I'm younger and healthier and then plan on moving back when I'm older?

Benz: Steve, you referenced healthcare costs. And I'd like your take on how people should forecast their healthcare spending in retirement. I know different entities have tried to make a go at this. Fidelity puts out that annual estimate, which I think most recently was like $300,000 that a 65-year-old couple would spend. But how do you coach people on thinking about healthcare costs in retirement, what their spending will be? And also, what kind of inflation adjustment should people assume when thinking about healthcare costs? Because, historically, that area has been inflating a lot higher than the general inflation rate.

Chen: Healthcare is one of those big ""gotchas"" in retirement planning. So, I would say being thoughtful, like we just talked about in terms of understanding your costs when you're working and then between working and Medicare and then in Medicare. We also think you should think about long-term care and help people explore different ways of funding that. We default in our platform a higher inflation rate for healthcare. So, what's happening in our platform is, we have a general inflation rate, we have a housing inflation rate, and we have a healthcare inflation rate. And so, we let people manipulate those. We set defaults based on what we've seen historically. But we also let people set their own. Some people, if they're in the military, and they have TRICARE, or if they're in the federal government, they have other benefits, we let them override and set their fixed costs if they have any. So, we see a lot of government folks that have really good healthcare and it's a huge benefit to them that they don't have that uncertainty that a lot of private sector folks have with this cost.

Ptak: You mentioned long-term care. Long-term care is one of the most vexing aspects of retirement planning. How would you suggest that people approach covering long-term care costs?

Chen: I think that, one, accept that there's a reasonably good chance that you're going to encounter long-term care costs. And we build some ways to think about it in terms of there are different strategies for this. You can spend your assets down and go on Medicaid, although that's a little riskier, and you give up a lot of control doing that. You could buy an annuity that kicks in around when you think you might need long-term care, or a hybrid product that has an income or healthcare benefit. I think that's an example of using insurance intelligently to hedge big known risks like longevity or the need for long-term care.

There's a math around when you need to buy this. If you're an average person with average savings, it can be good to buy long-term care. Because if you end up needing it, it can definitely blow up all your savings pretty quickly. If you have a lot of wealth, you could self-insure. So, we try to help people explore those options on the platform and think it through. But, yeah, it's a big known risk.

I would say the one thing about long-term care insurance itself is that the market has been… I wouldn't say it's a super-robust market. We've seen a lot of players drop out of that space. A lot of premiums have jumped up because the insurance companies didn't really price it effectively. They didn't really understand how quickly the costs are rising. And so, you saw people that had long-term care paying into it for a long time, then suddenly, such and such insurance company jacks up the premiums a ton, and then they drop it. So, they don't really get any benefit. And we've also seen firms just completely pulling out of the market, which makes it less efficient, because there are just not enough providers out there.

Benz: You referenced annuities, Steve, and I want to go back to that. You referenced them in the context of the long-term care problem. But many consumers, especially I would guess some of the do-it-yourself-type investors who would be most interested in NewRetirement probably have this reflexive avoidance of annuities because of their high costs and lack of transparency in many cases. So, are they wrong? Should people not have annuities necessarily marked with a skull and crossbones?

Chen: I think that annuities actually are great products if they're used appropriately. There are definitely some versions of annuities that are too complicated and have high fees and so that's why they get a bad rap. But there's also SPIAs, single premium immediate annuities, and then deferred versions of those, income annuities that I think can play a good role. So, one of the strategies that we like a lot is just longevity insurance. So, the biggest cost is, biggest risk for many people is, what if they live to a very long time? How do you plan for that? If you consider that you could live two decades longer than you're planning for, you got to fund it. But annuities are interesting because they neutralize that risk. So, you can buy a deferred annuity that kicks in at 85 at a super-low cost, because the reality is, most people won't be alive. But if you're lucky enough to be alive, then you'll capture all that income and you can really hedge out that longevity risk.

And I think also another way we think about them is… I met Zvi Bodie in this. So, he's an economics professor that I've done some work with in the past. And he talks a lot about lifecycle finance. And so, really what you're trying to do with planning is guarantee your quality of life over your lifecycle. And specifically, you want to guarantee things like having enough baseline income to meet your core needs. So, another way to use annuities is to separate out your core expenses that you're going to have for housing, for food, healthcare and transportation, and try and guarantee that income through being smart about Social Security, being smart about if you have a pension using that appropriately, and also, looking at fixed-income annuities to layer that in.

One of our users, this guy, Glenn Nakamoto, who ended up emailing us 6,000 words about how he built his own retirement paycheck. And one interesting thing he did was, he looked at what he needed, he built a plan, he ended up taking 30% of his investable assets and buying SPIAs, and he went around and he talked to at least three or four RIAs, so fiduciary financial advisors--all of them told him it was a bad idea. He still went ahead and did it. He thinks there was some conflict because of, even though they are fiduciaries, they're still paid on assets. So, if he's like, “Well, I could bring you X million, or it could be two thirds of that.” They're like, “Well, the full X million sounds more attractive.” But there are people doing it. I would say interest rates are low, so they don't look super attractive right now. But I think there's definitely a place for them in an integrated plan.

Ptak: There's also going to be a place for them inside 401(k) plans. As we know, recent legislation made way for annuities inside 401(k)s. Is that a good development in your view? And if so, what types of annuities do you think would tend to be most appropriate?

Chen: I do think that the evolution of what's happening with 401(k) plans and, the reality is--and we see this in our audience--if you're a normal person and you save, you end up with a lot of your money in your qualified bucket, your 401(k) or IRA. So, there's a lot of things that 401(k) providers can do, and employers can do through setting defaults and providing low-fee products, so people save enough, get into good, diverse portfolios that really helps them. And I think adding a lifetime income option in a 401(k) is a good idea so long as the products are simple, they're understandable, and they also jibe with the tax laws. So, there are QLACs, qualified longevity annuity contracts. And some of them do satisfy the RMD, the required minimum distribution, drawdowns that people face from their qualified assets.

So, I think they can definitely be an option. It's like all things. They have to be used wisely and there should be good education and guidance wrapped around it so there's no abuse that happens. Because you don't want misalignment where… Early in 401(k)s there were all these high-fee products that just didn't perform well. I think that's kind of getting squeezed out with the changes in education is happening and with annuities, you want to avoid that. So, low-fee products, simple, easy to understand, maybe don't let people dump 100% of their assets into an annuity that they might regret later, stuff like that.

Benz: I want to talk a little bit about how pre-retirees can think about how much they'll spend in retirement. It seems like people really wrestle with this and there are rules of thumb, like an 80% income replacement rate. So, how would you suggest people approach this issue, especially if they're, say, 10 or 20 years from retirement, so it just really seems like an abstraction? How can they be smart when thinking about what their in-retirement living expenses might actually look like?

Chen: That's a great question. I think what we're seeing our users do, that's a best practices--one, track your spending, especially as you get closer to retirement, and then really try to bucket it into what is a must-have expense and what's a nice-to-have expense, and what might go away? So, if you think I'm not going to save in my 401(k) anymore, my taxes might be lower--you can forecast a lot of this stuff. And so, that's where a lot of people do come up with a rule of thumb-- my spending might be 70% to 80% of what it was before I retired. But we also see other people in our community that are like, ""Well, my spending actually stayed up, because I ended up spending more money on things like, I have grandchildren, or I'm giving money to my kids or whatever; or my healthcare costs went up, and I wasn't anticipating that.""

So, I think, first, really, tracking expenses, separating them into “must have” and “nice to have.” I think setting a budget, being smart about that. It's a good activity. You don't have to do this at a super-granular level, but it's good to watch. And then think about how am I going to fund this? How am I actually going to deliver the income that I need in a way that lets me sleep at night? And so, there's different strategies that you can explore. You can build a floor of income, like we talked about with Social Security, a pension, and maybe an annuity. You can do a drawdown strategy where you keep your assets invested, and you set an appropriate risk level on your portfolio and you take it down at 3%, 3.5%, 4%. Or you can do a bucket strategy that's kind of a mashup where you're creating a much more liquid low-risk pool that you're constantly refilling. A lot of folks like to do that. It's slightly less efficient, but it does let you sleep better at night because you're like, “Hey, I've got one to two years of expenses sitting in CDs or in cash or cash-like instruments.” And then the rest is in more riskier things and I try to refill the liquidity bucket when it's more optimal.

So, there's lots of ways to do this. I really think it's good to just get educated about how you can do this. And this is the kind of thing that we have built into our platform where people can explore this. They can try the safe withdrawal rate. They can try based on expenses. They can also try, and for some of our users, and I think for many people, they actually over-save--if they have money--they over-save, and then they pass away with a ton of money that they give to their heirs. I talked to Morgan Housel, and … there's a scenario where there's like $30 trillion to $40 trillion that's going to get passed between generations coming up here. So, in our platform we also let you see, well, what if I spent everything, what did that look like? And so, we'll solve for the maximum drawdown rate if you want to end up with close to zero.

Ptak: I think maybe we'll talk about more flexible approaches to withdrawal and spending in a moment. But before we did so, it does seem to make sense to talk about the 4% rule. We've discussed in-retirement withdrawal rates a lot on the podcast, with some arguing that the 4% guideline is too risky, given low bond yields and not low equity valuations. How would you suggest retirees approach that question of how much they can safely take out? What kind of withdrawal rate assumptions do you make in the product that you offer?

Chen: I think that definitely in this low-interest-rate environment it's good to be cautious. It seems like long-term interest rates just are going down and they have been going down for quite a while. We think 4% is a reasonable rule of thumb. I've talked to other experts like Karsten Jeske. He runs early EarlyRetirementNow. He's a 3.5%. We're trying to build in more and more ways to look at this. So, you can run--we don't have this yet--but we want to let people run historical back-tests to what happens with their scenario at certain drawdown rates. We're trying to get to a point where we almost treat their plan like a pension. And you can say, given what we see, is it fully funded? Are you fully funded to deliver the lifetime income that you're likely to need in 95% or 99% of the cases?

I don't know if there's a great answer. We're definitely also seeing massive returns in the equity markets. But there's a lot of people who believe that the market has gotten ahead of itself and long-term returns are going to be far lower based on the recent runup that we've seen. There's definitely a reversion to the mean. I'm sure you guys know a lot more about this than I do. But the economy grows at a certain rate, the market grows at a certain rate, and it's hard to exceed that in the long term.

Benz: Well, speaking of that, and you referenced Karsten and EarlyRetirementNow, what do you think of withdrawal systems like the one that he embraces where the withdrawals vary based on equity valuations like Shiller PE?

Chen: I would say Karsten knows more about this than almost anyone I've met. And I've tried to learn from him. We actually built our withdrawal functionality based on some of the modeling that he's done. He's built a tool that's in a spreadsheet and we worked with him on this. We tried to automate a lot of that. We try to give people visibility so they can make their own decisions about how to draw it down. But I wouldn't say we've gotten to a point where we're automating it where if the CAPE is doing this, then we're suggesting that. Although I wouldn't be surprised that that, either us or other folks, deliver that kind of functionality in the future. When you look at a pension manager, they're looking at their funded ratio and they want to make sure that based on historical data that you're going to be able to deliver the benefit that you promised. And I think that's how we see what we're doing. So, we're working toward that. But it is a work in progress right now.

Ptak: Many people have benefited from the equity markets' strength--I think you just referenced that--for the better part of a decade that's been going on. But do you think some people are complacent with their equity-heavy portfolios, especially if retirement is close at hand?

Chen: I would say it's definitely starting to feel that way. The CAPE is high. And definitely certain parts of the market there's volatility. One of the senses I have--and I think other people see this--is that corrections seem much faster as time goes by. And the business cycle, things are moving faster. Technology is enabling everything to move faster. So, maybe that's right; maybe corrections are quicker. In March, we had a drawdown that was 20% to 30%. And it came roaring back. But I think that when you look back in history, bear markets--I was actually looking this up--there have been 16 since 1926. So, one happens every six years, and they last an average of 22 months, and the market loses an average of almost 40%. So, in 2007 to 2009, it was down almost 59% over 27 months; 1973 to 1974 it was down 48% over 21 months; and 1929 to 1932 it was down 86% over 34 months, that's when it's going down and then it has to recover. And then, most of the recovery happens in that first year. So, that's where you do have to stick with it.

For a lot of folks, I think, they haven't seen a sustained long-term downturn, since 2007-2009. So, how will they behave? Especially, we have a lot of new investors coming in through platforms like Robinhood. What will those folks do? I don't know. And then, how will that affect the market? It will be something we're going to discover, I think.

Benz: One thing I have been wrestling with, and I suspect you have, too, is that at this late stage in the bull market, and as low as bond yields are today, it's really hard to convince people of the merits of holding safer investments in their portfolio. So, how do you approach that? How does NewRetirement attempt to help people de-risk appropriately? Because we know sequence of return risk is such an issue for new retirees. How do you convince people to look at investments with 0.5% yield attached to them?

Chen: So, today, just for full disclosure, we don't advise on people's portfolios. We do provide education and guidance about what's happening in the world. But the world is today awash in negative real interest rates. We're seeing them around the world. I see key influencers and people like Jonathan Clements and Ben Carlson, really talking about bonds as almost cash-like instruments. It's a way to hedge risk. It's something to rebalance in and out of, but it's not generating--bonds are not generating and doing their historical function, which is, generating income in a material way.

So, you have to look at different ways to get it. And there's dividends. There's capital appreciation. There's annuitization, like we talked about, and neutralizing risk. I think claiming Social Security becomes a bigger deal, because you can get almost a 75% higher benefit if you wait; don't claim it at 62 but claim it at 70. And also, if you're married the key there is, you want the higher income earner to claim as late as possible because of not just the higher benefit they get, but also the survivor benefit. Social Security remains, or is, the gold standard for an annuity, and you basically can get it for a 30% discount to the private markets. So, you should be very smart about claiming it and potentially consider strategies like bridging.

I think those are some of the things and we have to see what happens with interest rates. It feels like--I'd love your guys' opinion--but it feels like we're in a unique point in history where we've started using things like quantitative easing in a huge way, we're using stimulus in a huge way, for good reasons, because we're facing an unprecedented pandemic. But, unfortunately, it's a challenge that everybody faces.

Ptak: Since you mentioned Social Security, and forgive me if you covered this, but obviously, one of the dimensions that one has to consider in making any kind of plans is whether it will be there. So, the Social Security Trust Fund is set to run out in 2031 barring some congressional action to shore it up. How would you suggest people embarking on retirement planning, model in potential changes to Social Security, if at all, and is that something that depends on their age?

Chen: A lot of millennials and younger folks believe that Social Security will not be there and they're assuming zero. I don't think that's going to happen. Right now, the Trust Fund, even if it gets exhausted, which is supposed to happen by 2031 if there's no changes made by Congress, it will still be able to pay 75% of promised benefits. So, I think, especially if you're approaching retirement, it's safe to assume that you're going to get at least 75% of your promised benefits.

What's the alternative? Before Social Security many older people were in poverty and we would go right back to that, because Social Security provides the income floor for at least half--I think it's a majority--of Americans, and if that happened all that load would fall on the families and that would hurt our productivity. And older folks also represent a huge active voting bloc. So, I don't think Social Security goes away. I think it's going to get shored up.

Same thing with Medicare. Now Medicare is a bigger problem. I think that Trust Fund is due to expire earlier and then they'll be able to pay like 80% to 90% of benefits, and the costs there are significantly higher. But the same thing. I don't think it goes away. I do think we have a long-term challenge in our country of how do we make delivery of healthcare more efficient, how do we bring healthcare costs--the amount we spend on healthcare--down significantly? Most other developed countries have equivalent healthcare outcomes that we do, but they spend far less of their GDP on it. So, I think we just need to get smarter about it. We need to get more efficient about how we deliver it.

I was reading an interesting study. One thing they're going to learn from this pandemic is that many people have held off from getting healthcare they would have gotten normally because they want to avoid hospitals. And does that affect outcomes? And I think there might be some data that shows that we do perfectly fine with less healthcare. So, maybe we shouldn't order every test, do everything XYZ for every person that comes in because we're so worried about getting sued. We should use the data and try to just be a lot more efficient with this and then that helps bend the healthcare curve.

Benz: I think we would all agree that retirement decumulation should be simpler, that there's a lot that's suboptimal about the way that we're doing things by handing them a big pot of money later in life. So, the question is, on the road to simplifying it, do you think it could be a single product like Vanguard's Managed Payout Funds, which aren't really around anymore? Or does it need to be a service? Is it something that cannot be productized in the way that some firms have tried to do it?

Chen: I think in the near term it's probably going to be much more of a service because there's still so much to learn in this space. We have all this history with 401(k)s and investing, and we're dramatically changing on the accumulation side. There's a giant rotation from active to passive, from high-fee to low-fee products and just educating people on what matters--that portfolio allocation matters, time in the market versus timing the market matters, your savings rate matters, all that stuff. We're going to have to learn some lessons in the decumulation space. So, I think that's going to be learned by this generation that's going first, designing solutions. But I think once a lot of the learning happens, yeah, I do think that there will be a future where it's much simpler. Target-date funds were a good innovation. They made it understandable on the accumulation side and they start to get people think about how you do the transition.

I think for folks, there's going to be some kind of solution that lets people almost check the boxes for what they're willing to do--am I willing to annuitize, do I want to optimize Social Security, do I want to move or use home equity, do I want to mutualize through like an annuity? We've definitely been thinking about this, and we think that there can be a solution that leverages choices, leverages mutualization, delivers a product and maybe it's more of a custom product, a slightly customized product that delivers a consistent quality of life for folks. But there's getting people to understand it, getting people to accept it. So, it will probably be a little bit of a journey.

Ptak: Shifting to retirement policy, you're not involved in setting policy, but you've probably thought about how our system in the U.S. could be better. If you had a chance to bend policymakers' ears about a single policy initiative that would help people with retirement deaccumulation, what would it be?

Chen: I think the idea of, one, focusing on income versus assets. Get people to reframe it that way would be helpful. And I think then looking at strategies, like should you be allowed to buy into Social Security? If people could say, ""Instead of getting $3,000 a month in Social Security, if I could put part of my portfolio toward that and buy my way to $5,000 a month in Social Security, would I do that?"" And you might see a lot of people doing that. So, I think the government does serve a function as being almost like a giant insurer, and they actually can be quite good at it as long as they avoid bad actors and inefficiency. But there's definitely some things that they do well--Social Security is an example; Medicare is also an example as long as there's people that are running scams on it, sometimes draining it. But I think that that's one way to look at it.

I think there's also helping people just keeping it simple for folks and helping them set defaults and enforcing that. We know what works for saving. So, get people to save at a higher rate. Set that default higher, maybe mandate it. Diversify portfolios. Rebalance on a regular basis and then fully automate these things. I think those kinds of things and choices and enforcing that would lead to much better outcomes across the board for many more people.

Benz: You referenced how defaults have really been quite affective in the 401(k) company retirement plan space. Are there any things that you wish policymakers would look at, though, in that sphere to help improve outcomes for people as they accumulate assets for retirement?

Chen: I think it's defaults, good portfolios, low-fee products. They are doing some of these things. They're making it easier for people to understand what they own. They are, I think, with the SECURE Act now you're translating what your savings might look like in terms of income, so being able to see that number is good. Because you might be walking around thinking I've saved $300,000 in my 401(k) and be like I'm great. But then if you see, ah, that actually translates to tens of thousands of dollars a year in annual income, you're like, ah, maybe that's not quite enough if you think that you might need $100,000 a year to live on in retirement. So, I think solutions like that.

I mean, I saw on Twitter recently someone was proposing that we give like every person born a default portfolio and then just throw it in the market and forget about it. It's kind of an interesting idea. I mean, I don't know if it's doable or would work, but like some kind of enforced savings that they can't touch, would be interesting.

Benz: Well, Steve, this has been a really thought-provoking conversation. We thank you so much for your time and being with us today.

Transcript

Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services. And I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

This week we’re pleased to bring you a special “State of Retirement Income” episode, which we recorded live at the annual Morningstar Investment Conference held recently in Chicago, Illinois. For this discussion, we turn the tables on Christine, who is part of an expert retirement planning panel that also includes David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions, and Karsten Jeske, the founder of Early Retirement Now. You’ll remember David and Karsten, who were our guests on past episodes of The Long View.

In this panel discussion that we recorded before a live audience, we delve into a number of retirement-planning topics, including the impact of inflation on spending patterns; the implications of the recent selloff on asset allocation; sequence of returns risk; optimal Social Security-claiming practices; the role and importance of guaranteed income sources; and a lot more. Without further ado, please enjoy this special episode of The Long View.

David, Christine, Karsten welcome. Thanks so much for participating, in this year's, Morningstar Investment Conference we're very pleased to have you.

I think we'll start with what is the topic of the moment. There are many, but certainly inflation probably is at the top of our pecking list of concerns. Christine, I'm going to start with you. Let's suppose I'm a retiree. I've targeted a 4% real spending rate. If I want to keep up with rising prices, that means withdrawing 8% more this year, give or take than I did last. Do you think that's advisable or is it better to spend less than that?

Christine Benz: I think the starting point, Jeff, when people think about this is to not just take 8% and run with it but take a look at personal spending. There's been this ongoing research about how older adults spend. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been calculating this parallel statistic called CPI-E that looks at how older adults spend. And when you compare that to the general CPI figures you see some changes in the consumption baskets that they use. So older adults tend to consume less energy. They tend to be commuting less. I think everyone's commuting less right now, but older adults always have been commuting less. So rising energy prices have affected them relatively less. They tend to spend a little bit less on food.

I would urge anyone who's working with retirees to go through that personalized calculation. I think they may find that in some categories they're spending more than the CPI figures would embed, but I think that is the starting point for this exercise. Rather than assuming that if inflation, if CPI is 8%, I'll naturally give myself that bump up. So, I think that that is the starting point. Another thing I think about is David's really influential research, which I know we're going to talk about, which is the trajectory of spending over retiree's life cycles. And David's research has shown that retirees do tend to spend a little bit less in the middle years of retirement. I think that argues someone's in the early phases of their retirement life cycle, they could potentially take more from their portfolio with the knowledge that they're spending will naturally come down.

Ptak: That's actually the next place I wanted to go with you, David. As Christine alludes to you've been a pioneer in studying how retirees spend. My question is, how does inflation potentially scramble that picture? For instance, could we see a scenario in which retirees are tempted to accelerate spending?

David Blanchett: The big uncertainty I think with retiree spending is healthcare. If you look at the retiree consumption basket, about 10% of spending is on healthcare when you're 65, about 20% at 85. And so, retirees in general actively choose to spend less over time. But healthcare is this rising share of overall spending. From my perspective, I think it is pretty safe to say hey, the average retiree spends less as they age, but the big uncertainty is where healthcare costs are going in the next say five, 10, or 20 years.

Ptak: I wanted to talk about the supply side, which is the nest eggs that we try to build up to fund our retirement spending. One question is, should I consider adjusting my approach to conserving and growing my retirement assets to mitigate the danger inflation poses to my net assets? That's a question that you've addressed relatively recently, Karsten. What's your take on that?

Karsten Jeske: First of all, I think we should resist this temptation that just because we have an economic shock, we don't have to throw out everything we know about retirement planning just because we have the shock, because it's still within the bounds of the historical spectrum of what we observed in terms of equity valuation. Yeah, it's higher than average, but remember the Trinity study and a lot of the retirement research on safe withdrawal rates has been calibrated to the historical worst-case scenarios, not the average scenarios. So, we are obviously worse than the average—higher equity valuation, still very low bond yields, high inflation—but we are not out of the bounds of the historical intervals of what we've seen, say double-digit inflation in the 1970s.

I don't think we have to reinvent everything from scratch. Just because we have 8% inflation. The first concern would be well what if the future is worse than the past. So, it's like that Simpsons joke where Bart says, ""Today is the worst day of my life."" And Homer says, ""Your worst day of your life so far."" The future could be worse than the past. But I don't quite see that we're going to have another 70% drop in the stock market like in 1929 to 1932. I don't quite see that.

I think the bigger concern is that even though historically the 4% rule might have been safe, there were also a lot of cases where the 4% rule in the end worked, but it was a very scary ride in between. I always use this analogy: Trinity Airlines, they have a 2% chance of crashing, but the other 98% could still be very scary plane rides and you don't know in real time if you're going to make it so this could be the reason why we probably tread a little bit lighter. So, for example, Morningstar had this study where they said, the safe withdrawal rate is probably about 3.3%, it’s not 4%, and it might still mean that the 4% rule works in the end. But with a 3.3% rate you might be safer, and it might be a more pleasant ride, and it doesn't look quite as bad as some of the historical cohorts. For example, in 1972 you had a cohort that depleted almost 70% of its assets over the first 10 years. In the end they made it. But they probably would have maybe gone back to work or would have changed their withdrawal rate halfway or one third into retirement.

So, one way to hedge against uncertainties, and not just running out of money, but also the volatility in between is obviously do lower withdrawal rate like you suggested, like I've suggested in my studies.

Ptak: I also wanted to ask, and we'll talk some more about portfolio construction sequence of returns risk and then consider your suggestion for what it is we should take up as part of this panel. Before we did that, though, I think it's become writ that people should bump up their savings rates to offset paltry yields and what appear to be lofty valuations. But now yields have risen, stocks have sold off, and multiples are maybe a bit less stressed. And so, do you think that takes some of the pressure off to step up savings? Or do you think that's inadvisable to be sending that kind of message to retirees at this point? And maybe I'll turn to you, Karsten, for that one.

Jeske: As I said, people use this 4% rule of the 25x spending. Well, if you do 30x spending so you have at least that cushion if the market draws down in the near term and maybe after the first little bit of the drawdown, then you have the 4% rule, then you'll probably have a safer and a safer-feeling retirement. And don't just worry about your making it after 30 years; also think about how scary the ride might be over the first 10 years, which is where really the sequence of return risk comes in.

Ptak: Christine, when you've gotten questions like that—can I go a little bit easier on my savings now that bond yields are higher and my money is working a little bit harder for me, what kind of counsel have you offered?

Benz: I think for people in accumulation mode, Jeff… We were talking to Cliff Asness yesterday and he made the very good point that, for accumulators, this is kind of what you want, that you want to be a buyer in down markets, and you want to be selling that stuff when the market's elevated. So for people in the accumulation phase, yes, I think that perversely it hasn't felt good, but I think that the fact that we have seen stock valuations come down a little bit, that bond yields appear to be going to lend more of a helping hand than they have in the past, that argues that potentially savers could take the pressure off themselves a little bit, but I think inflation is still a headwind, which argues for certainly maintaining ample equity exposure for people who are still in the accumulation/saving phase.

Ptak: David, wanted to turn to you for the next one, which is a tough one. Bonds have gotten whacked recently and that probably has been a rude awakening for retirees who've come to depend on income streams and also the diversification benefits, I should say, that they confer from it. What, if anything, do you think that they should do in the face of the selloff in fixed income? Stay the course?

Blanchett: I think staying the course is key, I think that thinking about alternative investments or other ways to diversify portfolio. But I don't think that bonds are dead. I think they play an important role in portfolio and it's kind of foolish this notion that the 60/40 is no longer a valid portfolio because it really has stood the test of time, not just in the U.S. historically, but also across the international markets.

Ptak: And, Karsten, I take it that you concur as well when it comes to something like the traditional U.S. 60/40 portfolio or even a global 60/40. You think that will stand the test of time? Or do you think people should be considering modifications to it?

Jeske: I'm tempted to do a little bit of what Cliff Asness said yesterday. You almost have no choice but to raise your risk a little bit, so maybe the new 60/40 has now become 70/30. That could be one option. The other option is, of course, now that bond yields are again at least 3%, if we have a slowdown, probably they have some room to go down. They could be a diversifier again. And so, it's don't run now, don't sell at the bottom of the bond market because now it actually looks like bonds can have this diversification feature again.

Ptak: I did want to ask about sequence of return risk, which is the bugaboo for many about to retire or early retirees. Christine, for those folks, they're potentially facing a bad scenario. They've only recently retired, they're about to, markets have sold off—that heightens their sequence of return risk. If you're one of them confronting this, what, if any, adjustments should they be thinking about making to ensure that they don't outlive their savings?

Benz: A few things. I think the starting point would be to be thinking about some sort of flooring for the retirement plan. Thinking hard about Social Security strategy, thinking about whether there is a role for some sort of an annuity product to just provide the fixed expenses that the household is requiring. And so, I love that as the starting point to think about, how can we supply lifetime income sources to meet those very basic needs? And then from there I think the idea of employing some sort of a variable withdrawal strategy makes a lot of sense. In our research, we explored a variety of different variable withdrawal strategies, but being willing to vary that withdrawal based on what's going on with the portfolio, and unfortunately, that means taking a little bit less in weak market environments. And then I think in terms of the portfolio composition, making sure that there are enough safe assets to draw upon so that you're not having to touch depressed equity or fixed-income assets.

I know we're going to talk about the bucket strategy. I've been thinking about that Jaws line: ""You're going to need a bigger bucket."" But I have been thinking that cash for someone's active spending needs, I think even though inflation will eat it alive over time, I think the bucket strategy because it does call for having those liquid reserves to meet near-term cash flows—I think can provide not just those living expenses, but also a lot of peace of mind to put up with the volatility that's going on with the long-term portfolio.

Ptak: Why don't we bring back up the polling question. And we can see what you've had to say, and it looks like it's B) the 4% spending rule, can it be sustained? David, we'll turn to you on this. The 4% spending rule, which I think many of you are familiar with. Can it be sustained? And then more generally what is a good framework by which to think about a sustainable withdrawal rate?

Blanchett: So, I'm probably more like team 4% or even 5%. And I'm going to caveat that real quick. Because there's lots of assumptions you have to use in a model to figure out what is a safe withdrawal from a portfolio. And you want to use realistic returns, realistic mortality periods, and the key is that the way that we measure outcomes that I think is incredibly flawed. If you all run a Monte Carlo simulation for clients and most early research in retirement did this, you do a success analysis. You say, ""It's a binary outcome: one, if you pass; zero, if you fail. You average those together. There's no context around the magnitude of failure, and that's really important in the context of 1) Almost every retiree has guaranteed income. Some of that covers most or all of their nondiscretionary spending; and 2) households have the capacity to cut back on spending in retirement.

It's very different liability than say, a pension liability. And so, when I think about 4%, does it work? To me the questions are, how much of your income goal is covered from guaranteed income? And what is your flexibility? If you have very little guaranteed income and no flexibility, while 3% is the new 4%. But for most Americans who have a significant portion of their retirement income via things like Social Security and pensions, and have some flexibility, I think 5% is actually not too off base, as a starting target for retiree.

Ptak: Karsten, what do you think?

Jeske: You would be shocked how many people, for example, in the early retirement community say, ""I'm going to completely ignore Social Security,"" and then they run their retirement simulations and then they come up with 3.5%. Of course, there's some people in the early retirement community where they try to outdo each other. One retires at 29 and then somebody is 28. I think now somebody retired at 22, but that's not the norm. The norm in the early retirement community is people my age. In their 40s, maybe even early 50s, they'll retire. If they don't take into account that they have Social Security in just a decade or a decade and a half—they should take that into account and they basically have this two-stage process or maybe even more stages than that.

So first you withdraw only from your portfolio, then Social Security compliments your retirement. And then you might even further drawdown, further scale down your expenses later in retirement, so you have this multistage process taking into account future cash flows, future reductions in spending. Absolutely most people can actually start with something like a 5% or 6% withdrawal from their portfolio. And then, of course, the withdrawals from the portfolio they will be scaled down even though your consumption might even stay the same. I'm completely with you. Of course, the 25-year-old retiree shouldn't go at 5% with today's equity valuation. It should be more personalized, and the personalization obviously has to go in two dimensions. One is the macro picture and then one is this idiosyncratic of your parameters. How old are you? What supplemental cash flows do you have? Do you have Social Security, government pension, a corporate pension? Once you factor that all in, very easily you can get 5% or more for some retirees.

Ptak: David, you alluded to some research that Christine and I and a colleague of ours, John Rekenthaler, had done on sustainable withdrawal rates. We did come up with less than 5, in fact, less than 4. It was 3.3%. But to your point, we were focused on that pot of money as if it was going to sustain the retiree throughout retirement. So that is a very useful distinction to draw. Christine, I wanted to turn to you for a minute and maybe widen out. You talk to retirees on a very regular basis. What are the biggest mistakes you see people make in setting their withdrawal rate and do you think they more often overspend or underspend?

Benz: Well, I think it depends on the cohort and it depends on the time period. But research from Vanguard and others have shown that in fact, underspending is, I think, a significant issue with many retirees, especially as we've had this steady march upward in terms of equity prices. We have many retirees who probably quite underspend relative to what they could spend, and that may be a choice. They may have a strong bequest motive that is motivating them to spend less, but I think that when we look at the data over the past decade and I would guess that it's true of many of the advisors' clients, that tendency to underspend is a bigger deal and a bigger problem. I sometimes will meet an 80-plus-year-old retiree who will come up and proudly tell me that he spends 3% of his portfolio per year. So, he's just taking out that fixed percentage of that portfolio and I'm thinking holy cow. I hope that your quality of life is good at that level, because to me that sounds way too small of a percentage, especially at that life stage.

Ptak: Maybe turning to the psychology of withdrawing. What do you think are some of the most useful tools retirees can use to manage through the psychology of withdrawing? I'm sure that one of the things that will come to mind, Christine, because you've done so much work on it is bucketing. Maybe you can talk about why it is you think bucketing has the merit that it has?

Benz: I was initially introduced to bucketing, talking to Harold Evensky, probably 12 almost 15 years ago. And Harold was a financial planner, he's largely retired now. He was a professor of financial planning. And he mentioned this bucket approach that he used with his clients, which was basically a cash bucket that he bolted onto the long-term portfolio that he was managing for them. And his comment to me was that it just gave his clients an extraordinary amount of peace of mind with the long-term plan. So, he would call them up in environments like right now and say ""How are you feeling? Your portfolios dropped quite a bit. Are you still comfortable with this?"" And they'd say ""Yes, because we have our cash needs set aside in this bucket, number one,""—whatever you want to call it, the liquidity bucket. ""And so, we know that we can still take that cruise that we had planned with our family for next year. We can still keep going out to dinner on Saturday night."" The things that really constitute quality of life for his clients. Those needs were all being met because they had that liquidity bucket set aside.

I always think with bucketing, advisors don't have to use buckets at all, but I do think that it's a helpful construct when talking about, well, here's the asset allocation that I'm recommending. Here's how we're doing things to help the client understand whatever asset allocation that you're recommending, and also just how the volatility in the market is not going to disrupt any near-term plans.

Ptak: David, maybe to build on an earlier comment that you made. It sounds like one of the tools that retirees could use to manage through the psychology of withdrawal is understanding the totality of their wealth, the sources of their cash flows and their durability. Other things come to mind that you think are particularly worthwhile tools that retirees should consider just to make sure that they can withdraw in an orderly way and with peace of mind?

Blanchett: I think that to me the reason it's so fascinating, when you see people underspend because they've undersaved. So how is it that you are underspending when you've under saved it's because it's just so hard to take money from a portfolio when you have an uncertain life span. You don't know how long you're going to live. And so, when you read, you see the surveys that ask retirees: How do they think about their savings and their spending? They don't want to deplete their capital, and so I think that creating behavioral mechanisms to help someone do that is incredibly valuable. Like buckets, for example, I'm a huge fan of them, because I think that they're very valuable behavior way to help someone improve how they think about market risk. That being said, I don't know that there's huge academic benefits to them, you can create synthetically—the same thing with the portfolio, I think that's the key. It's the psychology of clients, and I'm sure you see a lot, helping them make better choices that, even with an advisor, they wouldn't make on their own.

Jeske: Right. One is, have a plan. That gives you confidence. Then update your plan. So, for example, if you're 80 years old and you're still spending that 3%, well, have you updated your plan along the way? And obviously in defense of that 80-year-old, you can say well, the equity returns were probably so spectacularly above expectation, so your portfolio outgrew your spending. But regularly updating your plan and imagining three years into retirement, imagine you were to retire today again. With your current portfolio and your current spending, does it still work? Am I still confident?

And yes, I agree. So, the bucket strategy in some way is window dressing because if you rebalance the buckets, of course your money is fungible. You take it out of the cash bucket, but then your risky assets have to replenish the bucket. But it's helpful, of course, in the sense of coming up with an asset allocation because we can't be 100% equities, we have to have some safe assets and there are different ways of gauging what is the right percentage of safe assets. One would be the bucket, where you have the bucket in the sense that, well, I want to make it through this length of a recession and this length of a weak economy like the 1970s, but you can't be overly bond heavy because you want to hedge against the supply side shock in the 70s. But you want to have some bonds in there because you want to have the diversification benefits if we have a demand-shock recession.

So, you want to have some equity, some bonds, some cash. And I look at it from a historical simulation point of view. Some people do the Monte Carlo simulations, but you could arrive at the same results, roughly and very intuitively, through the bucket strategy. So, in that sense it helps, obviously.

Ptak: Christine, I wanted to ask you about flexible withdrawal approaches, which I think have come up several times during the course of the conversation. They can support higher withdrawals by as you put it, putting spin on the ball. Can you talk about the pros and cons of these approaches and who they might be right for?

Benz: That was a big thrust of our paper. Everyone took that 3.3% number and ran with it. We did spend a lot of time looking at these variable strategies because we began with the argument that well, in a lot of ways these fixed real withdrawal systems are a little bit of a straw man because people don't spend that way. David, your research has shown that, and then we also know that the variable strategies do tend to do a better job of helping a portfolio last throughout a 25- or 30-year time horizon. So, we tested a lot of different variable strategies and we're basically testing a couple of things. One, is can this variable strategy help enlarge lifetime withdrawals?

If we're using that 3.3% as a starting withdrawal rate. If we are able to be variable, can we lift that starting withdrawal and in turn lift lifetime withdrawals? And indeed, we found that the variable strategies do just that. They help the retirees’ cash flow calibrate up and down based on what's going on with the portfolio. Jeff, I should credit you because you did all the work on this, but when we looked at the strategy that did the best job of the ones that we tested of enlarging lifetime income, the guardrails system did the best job of ratcheting up and down. And it's a ratcheting system that is based off of the portfolio's value, annually updating. And we found that it did the best job of delivering the highest lifetime cash flow.

The downside of a strategy like that is that for bequest-minded retirees it'll tend to leave less leftover at the end because the name of the game is that you're spending less in down markets, but you can also spend more in up markets and that means that you're going to consume your whole portfolio because you are annually revisiting this. That was the strategy that showed best of the four that we tested. Another really simple strategy that we looked at that showed reasonably well—it's just a modest variation on the 4% guideline—the fixed real retirement spending where we simply said in a down market, in the year after a down market, forgoing the inflation adjustment in that year after the portfolio incurs losses, is another way to help lift that starting withdrawal rate and lift lifetime withdrawals.

I would say the big negative of that is that if you're in an environment like this one after a year like 2022, would an advisor want to turn around and tell their clients, “No inflation adjustment for you this year,” where you have a down market that's running in tandem with inflation, I think that that is the downside to such a strategy.

Ptak: Wanted to talk a bit about guaranteed income. It was actually one of our polling questions. Should retirees be considering tools like annuities? Maybe we'll broaden that out a little bit, David. Can you talk about the best framework for determining whether or not you're a good candidate for a guaranteed income product of some sort, like an annuity, and related to that for those who are candidates, what type of annuity do you prefer?

Blanchett: Before we start throwing out the ""A"" word, I think delaying claiming Social Security is the place that every person today should get guaranteed income. Its tax advantage, linked to inflation. I'd love to be in an environment where every advisor says half of my clients delay claiming to age 70. I think lot of the tools that exist out there right now that help you figure out when to claim, don't do a very good job. If you delay claiming to age 70 and you die at 71, your kids get all your stuff. That's not a bad outcome. The bad outcome is living to age of 110 and depleting their resources to keep you doing well.

When I think about guaranteed income, that's the first place that I start. And I think the key question with all of it is how much certainty do you need to have in terms of income every year, no matter what? I think that where you see the biggest problems with withdrawal rates and spending is when someone says, “I need to have $100,000 a year in nondiscretionary spending. I only get $30,000 from Social Security.” They're the ones who really need guaranteed income. Now, there could be benefits to have, beyond that ""needs goal"" but I think that a very basic framework does a really good job figuring out how much do you need in terms of lifetime guaranteed.

Jeske: Maybe until a year and half ago I would have said so. The SPIA, or single premium immediate annuity, it's not such a bad deal. Yields are a little bit low, but again, for somebody who needs that safety net, who needs that consumption floor, who has the non-negotiable consumption floor, maybe invests in an annuity. Sure, it's going to be depleted and decayed over time at a relatively constant inflation rate. Back then everybody thought it's 2% and then every year it's kind of range-bound between 1% and 3%. It doesn't really go much above, doesn't go much below, and if it goes above 3% one year, then the next year it reverts back and it's probably 1% the next year. And then this slow decay of 2% over time might be even desirable. You get a little bit more upfront and then you decay it over time, but of course right now we're in this inflation environment—nobody knows how long this 8% inflation is going to last. Nobody knows is inflation going to go back to 2%.

The previous speaker Sammy, he made this really good point. Is there a concern that the Fed might say 4% inflation, we're happy with that now, because we don't want to risk a recession. We are happier with 4% inflation and 6% unemployment, than 2% inflation and 10% unemployment and causing a recession. So now there is actually this uncertainty about what are inflation rates over the next 30 years. So, the Fed has definitely thrown us a little bit of a screwball here. And I'm not that optimistic anymore about the SPIA, but I used to be.

Ptak: I'll throw this to the whole panel, building on some of your comments on Social Security. There's the question of when to start claiming—that's a key question. Social Security payments are inflation adjusted and so now that we have higher inflation, does that change the calculus at all about when someone should claim? For instance, should someone be a bit more eager to claim if they covet the inflation protection that Social Security payments confer? Or do you think the same math, the same rationale toward claiming applies? Anybody?

Benz: I would say one point to make on that front is that you get the inflation adjustment on your delayed claim. Once you're full retirement age, that is counted toward your eventual benefit, so I…

Ptak: You get it anyway.

Benz: Right.

Ptak: So, it shouldn't factor at all in your claiming decision.

Benz: Right, I don't think so. But I would urge people to, especially for married couples it does make sense to. I would use one of the calculators that helps you look at ideal claiming dates because it does get complicated for married partners with two sets of earnings histories, so there's a free tool that I like called Open Social Security, but there are a variety of other, I think mostly paid tools. But I think that that's well worth investing in because the decision is just so impactful in terms of the health and longevity of the overall plan.

Blanchett: And so just one quick note there is no private annuity today that is offered that explicitly links to inflation. There used to be a few SPIAs back in the day. So, I think the only thing there is all of a sudden if you are really affected by inflation, you're freaking out by it. Social Security is the one place you can go to get protected lifetime income that gives you that explicit hedge.

Jeske: So back to your original question: Social Security is more valuable now. We have more uncertainty about inflation. Social Security is the hedge, so it's more important and it probably pushes more people into that upper constraint—the claim at age 70.

Ptak: I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about FIRE, Financial Independence, Retire Early, Karsten. Naturally, I'll turn to you on this. This is arguably the first time since the global financial crisis that some in the FIRE movement have been tested by difficult market conditions. We did have March of 2020, but that was such a brief plunge down, and then we zoomed right back up that maybe they didn't have time to dwell on it. What are you hearing from FIRE proponents who are trying to adapt to the new realities that the market is presenting?

Jeske: You always hear these rumblings. For example, 2018 was another case. I retired in 2018 and right around that time, we also had the Fed scare in 2018 in the fourth quarter. And it's amazing how quickly people lose their nerves, and obviously some people fell off the wagon there. But I think, overall, because a lot of people in the FIRE community are not yet retired, so they found out about this maybe two to three years ago. They started at net worth zero, they're planning a retirement date, maybe 2030, 2035. So, for them they could actually use some of this dollar-cost averaging. For example, when I started my 401(k) contributions was in the year 2000, right around the market peak and I stayed the course and used the dollar-cost averaging.

So, I think that there are obviously always these naysayers who will say, “Well, there's a market drop, so that's the end of the FIRE community.” I think it's the opposite. People will still come in because the pandemic taught us that we don't want to work until age 67. There's also another within the niche movement of FIRE. There is another niche, which is this extreme frugality movement. A lot of people will come in there because they see, “I get a 3% pay raise and now we have 8% inflation. I have to cut my spending. So how do I do that?” And they Google and then they find the frugal movement and then maybe through that, through the back door come into the FIRE movement. So, I think the FIRE community is alive and well and I think we’ll still grow.

Ptak: What do you think of the key applications of FIRE to the broader retirement public? Maybe someone who's retiring in their 60s, what could they learn from a FIRE adherent?

Jeske: The biggest challenge obviously for early retirees is that we can't really use the Trinity study—this fixed 30-year retirement horizon with fixed spending because you retire, say at age 45, and then you have this multi-stage process where first you withdraw from a portfolio, then you get the supplemental cash flows. So, there's a huge demand for personalizing your retirement strategy. It has to be different for the 28-year-old and the 48-year-old. It has to be different for somebody who is 48 years old, who expects Social Security and the company pension, or maybe a government pension. Because we have these different stages in retirement, but traditional retirees face that, too. They have potential spending shocks either up or down. They might have to think about sending their grandkids to college. Or they might scale down their spending when they go from the go years to the slow years to the no-go years.

This personalization aspect should be the same for both cohorts. Of course, the horizon is different, but a lot of the bells and whistles that we should be thinking about—the idiosyncratic parameters and then also the market conditions that we face right now. I think we can definitely learn from each other there.

Ptak: We're going to turn to audience questions in a moment here, and thanks to those of you who have already submitted it using the app. If you haven't done so, feel free to hop in and pose a question and our moderator will try and funnel it to us in our remaining time here. Before we do that, though, Christine, I wanted to turn to you. On the podcast we've talked to a number of experts who study what leads to a fulfilling retirement. Looking beyond the dollars and cents, what has your research and experience with retirees taught you is the key to a happy retirement?

Benz: Jeff and I interviewed Laura Carstensen, who's the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, and I think that was one of our favorite interviews that we've ever done. Just so thought-provoking about living, throughout our lives, and she made the point that this sort of border between work and retirement should be more porous. That she feels like and really throughout our lives that there may be times earlier in our careers where family demands might require us to pull back on work. So super thought-provoking interview with her about what gives retirees happiness.

I think the key theme from her and from Michael Finke—who, David, I know you've collaborated with for many years—is engagement in some sort of pursuit. Doesn't need to be paid work, but some sort of pursuit that provides you with the sense that I'm providing value here on Earth and that might be engagement with family, grandkids, whatever it is, social bonds. Laura's work certainly shows that staying engaged socially is absolutely essential to our happiness throughout our lives. But especially as we age. And interestingly she pointed out that retirees tend to bring down their social circles a little bit. They cast off some people who maybe weren't true close friends and so their friendships become higher quality as they age. And I love that advisors increasingly are embarking on this journey with their clients, where they are thinking about them holistically from the standpoint of not just making sure their portfolios last but making sure that their time-on-Earth allocations are just as thoughtfully made as those financial allocations.

Ptak: Given the fact that we are at 10 minutes to go, why don't we open it up for audience questions? So, you want to take it away.

Question Moderator: Yes, we've received several versions of the following question from Caleb Bird. Many retirement-savers I talked to think Social Security won't be there for them by the time they retire. Is this fear warranted?

Blanchett: No. I think anyone that reads the news knows that it's not. It's not fully funded. But even then, if you look at the PAYGO statistics, about three fourths of benefits can be paid. I just have a really, really hard time believing that we're going to cut grandmom's Social Security check. I think there are going to be structural changes to the system. I think it's going to affect younger Americans. But I have a really hard time believing that it's not going to be there, in its mostly full form as it exists today.

Jeske: I think you have to make it to age 55. That seems to be historically, because you're not going to do that rug-pull from existing retirees or people right before retirement, and then even at age 55. That's where the changes will be slowly phased in. It's not going to be boom, January 1st, that year is your birthday, you lose 20% of your benefits. It will be slowly rolled in. Probably anybody who will be between the ages of 55 and 35 at the time when the changes have to be made, that's where there's going to be a phase-in. I cross my fingers 2029, it's going to be after that, and I'll be safe.

Question Moderator: What is the current state of the art in dealing with potentially catastrophic long-term-care expenses in retirement?

Ptak: Who would like to take that? Christine?

Benz: I can take that. I'm obsessed with this topic. As many of my colleagues know, both of my parents had a long-term care need later in life. Thankfully, they had the funds to cover it, but experienced just how high those costs can be, especially where you have two partners. And, unfortunately, the state of funding long-term care, there aren't any good answers. I think the long-term-care insurance market is quite troubled. We've seen the purchases of pure long-term-care policies go way, way down. These hybrid life insurance/long-term-care policies have increasingly taken up the slack. But I always urge people to plot themselves on a spectrum, so at the low end in terms of having very modest assets, you'd want to think about relying on government-provided care. Medicaid is the largest payer of those expenses in the U.S. Not a great solution, but the solution for many people.

And then at the other extreme would be more affluent people, who will likely have the funds to supply or defray any long-term-care needs. What I always say is, if you're in that camp, I think it's important to maybe set aside a separate bucket, perhaps a fourth bucket for the end of life, whether it is a really long life span or long-term-care need. Or if you don't have either of those eventualities, maybe the money then is going to your heirs. But I like the idea of thinking about what those expenses might look like. I think if you're looking at a married couple, you would maybe want to take a two-year long-term-care need per partner and then look at the Genworth statistics about the expenses, which would maybe get you to 400,000, 500,000.

What I don't like is when I hear these one-size-fits-all cutoffs about, oh, if you have $2 million or whatever it might be you're fine to self-fund long-term care. And the reason is I don't know what you're spending from that $2 million portfolio. If your spending is overly generous, that may not be enough. So, I think it's really valuable for advisors to do that customization for clients and to really talk it through, because this is such an area of angst for older adults. In fact, when I speak to groups of retirees, this is the one question that gets people really energized and not in a good way. They are very, very worried about these costs eroding their portfolios entirely.

Question Moderator: David mentioned that the 60/40 portfolio has stood the test of time here and abroad. Few of the datasets contain a period where a 50-year decking interest-rate super-cycle reverses. How might this change the role of fixed income in a portfolio?

Blanchett: I think that there is this prospect of rising yields. There's this great study that the Bank of England did that came out a year or two ago that shows that interest rates have been going down pretty consistently for the last like 700 years. I don't have all the answers. I don't think anyone knows where the markets are headed next month versus next year. But I think the right portfolio does require some combination of safe and risky assets. I think that those safe assets are likely to be bonds, and then how you build the portfolio can vary by client. I think that buckets make a ton of sense for retirees and similar strategies can work through for folks in accumulation.

Jeske: Obviously the reason why we had the super-cycle is because we had that runup in interest rates between 1960s and 1982. So again, the 60/40 portfolio would have survived that negative, that bad super-cycle up to double digits. And obviously it helped a lot on the way down. One of the historical worst-case scenarios where, say, a 60/40 portfolio with a 4% withdrawal rate worked more or less, it included double-digit interest rates and interest rates at almost 20%. So that's something we should still keep in mind.

Question Moderator: Large asset managers are starting to create retirement-income offers for plan participants through product service offers. What are your reactions to these solutions?

Ptak: Who'd like to take that one? Christine, go for it.

Benz: I have felt like this is the area that asset managers need to work on because there is so much that is suboptimal about our current system where it's like, ""Hey, you're 65, we know cognitive decline is a thing, and here's your pot of money and figure it out."" Especially in this really quite low, still quite low interest-rate environment. I love the idea of—and of course they won't all be good—but turnkey paycheck equivalent retirement-income solutions are completely needed in this marketplace, and maybe it's the kind of thing that advisors do for their clients. But I love the idea that increasingly we're seeing this adoption of retirement-income solutions in 401(k) plans to really make this simpler because it's so overdue.

Blanchett: I am super-pumped as well.

Jeske: I'm waiting for some sort of a crowd-funded innovation of, not a pension fund, but basically a sequence of return hedge between savers and retirees. For example, a buy-and-hold investor doesn't care about sequence of return risk. If you take one saver and one retiree, you lump them together, you have again a buy-and-hold investor that doesn't care about sequence of return risk. And, because depending on how your sequence is, sometimes the saver benefits, sometimes the retiree benefits, and if you could lump them together and they could form a team, say over the next 10-15 years, we match up one retiree with one saver. Then we have, it's not a pension fund, because it doesn't hedge against longevity; it just hedges the sequence of returns. It doesn't even hedge equity risk. Because the average return still determines what's your final portfolio value. It purely hedges the sequence of return risk if we lump together. But I don't know how you would do that. Somebody in Silicon Valley should think about that.

Ptak: I think we have time for one more so if you've got one.

Question Moderator: It might be a little hairy. What does the panel think about probability Monte Carlo analysis—can these systems be improved? Are they assessing enough?

Blanchett: I think it can definitely be improved. I just think that I like the idea of stochastic models, but I just hate the fact that we, almost everyone, quantifies outcome as success or fail and doesn't incorporate dynamic spending, doesn't actually reflect reality.

Ptak: I have one final question to ask you all and you can answer it really quick. What do you think the pandemic has revealed about retirement planning that wasn't as apparent before? Christine, anything come to mind? Emergencies, spending money in reserves is that one?

Benz: For sure. This is kind of separate from the decumulation question, but I love the idea of using healthy mental accounting like the bucket system for emergency savings. I love the idea of helping workers save for rainy days that they can tap those funds that might not necessarily get any tax benefits. But I think there's more to be done in the realm of healthy forms of mental accounting, and I think that emergency funding embedded within the employer-provided context can make a ton of sense. I'm excited to see more uptake of that.

Ptak: We're up on time, so we'll leave it there. Christine, David, Karsten thanks so much for your insights. Please join me in thanking the panel.

(Please stay tuned for important disclosure information at the conclusion of this episode.)

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Amy Arnott: And I’m Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Anne Lester. She’s author of a new book called Your Best Financial Life: Save Smart Now for the Future You Want. Before writing the book, Anne spent 20 years as head of retirement solutions for J.P. Morgan. With AARP, she co-founded The Aspen Leadership Forum on Retirement Savings.

She earned a master’s in international economics and Japan studies from Johns Hopkins University and a B.A. from Princeton. She was also awarded a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship.

Anne, welcome to The Long View.

Anne Lester: Well, thank you so much for having me.

Benz: Well, we’re excited to have you here and congratulations on the book, Your Best Financial Life. Maybe you can talk about your motivation for writing the book.

Lester: Thanks so much. I think there were a couple of different things motivating me. I guess for starters, I’ve always wanted to write a book and in fact have an unpublished novel I wrote in my 20s and 30s in the bottom of a desk drawer somewhere. So, it’s been a lifelong ambition. I guess I listened to the “write what you know” advice. So, I certainly know this topic pretty well. And I know it from several different perspectives. One, obviously as an investment professional who spent 20-plus years focusing on how to build investment products for people to help them save for retirement. But also from a very personal perspective, I found a lot of what I was learning about is I really dove into the defined-contribution system very personal because I was a textbook example of all of the mistakes people make when they’re trying to save themselves— maybe not so much on the investing side, but certainly on the saving side. So I think I’m writing this book maybe for my younger self, but also very much for my children and for frankly, everybody I talked to along the way, working on this book who really is struggling often to overcome not just the realities of saving, which are challenging, but also their own personal feelings of maybe shame and fear and the little voice in their head that says, you should do a better job at this. So that’s why I wrote the book.

Arnott: So, I think you partially answered our next question, which is why did you focus your book on a younger audience, mainly millennials and Gen Z versus people who are getting ready to retire or already retired, for example.

Lester: Again, there are multiple reasons, but a big one is—and I don’t mean this to discourage anybody who is older—but if you’re in your 50s or 60s and have not started saving yet, it’s a really different conversation than it is with a 30-year-old who hasn’t started saving yet. And so, part of it is just—I don’t want to say easy because none of this is easy—but it’s a less challenging, maybe less sacrificial conversation when you’re younger because you do have time. And time is your friend when you’re in your 20s and 30s. When you’re in your 50s and 60s, time is, from an investing perspective, certainly much less of a friend. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons. The other reason is, again with children this age, I hear and see so much—I don’t know, nihilism or fear or “we’ll never be able to do it.” And I just don’t think that’s true. So, another one was really trying to dispel that fear.

Benz: It seems like a lot of people have tried to crack this nut with books and websites, trying to help younger people with their financial wellness. And I’m wondering if you can think about what you view as your “secret sauce” or what are you trying to do differently than other entities that have tried to address the same audience and the same general topic?

Lester: Well, clearly, we’re not getting it right because I don’t think the savings rates—the proof is in the pudding and it’s not all that great. And as you say, there are many, many, many books out there like this. I think I’m trying to do two things that are maybe a little different. The first is, approach it—it’s basically integrating the behavioral, the why with the how. And I think there are lots of books on the why and a lot of books that take a deep dive into the behavioral economics and the importance of it for personal finance. But I don’t know that many books have successfully integrated the why of the wiring and the how you do it as explicitly as I’ve done. So that’s one big differentiator.

The second big differentiator is I think—and I am one of them—financial-services professionals tend to get stuck in jargon. I think we assume that this stuff is interesting. And I think most people don’t find it the least little bit interesting. They just want it all to go away, and I think they can, without intending to, sound condescending. And so, I really tried very hard to sound approachable, relatable, human, not to use jargon, but also, and I think there are plenty of great books that have come out very recently aimed at this demographic written by people this age, I think those books are a, “Hey, I’ve done it all right and I can teach you to do it, too.” I’m taking kind of a different approach, which was, “Wow, I made every mistake you made, and I’ve learned a lot. And let me share that with you from the perspective of someone who has made the mistakes and learned, but also from the perspective of someone who spent 30 years as a professional investor.” And so, I think that’s a bit differentiated as well.

Arnott: What are some of the key areas where you depart from the conventional wisdom about how this group of younger investors should be managing their finances?

Lester: I think at a high level, I am trying very hard to make sure that people don’t feel—I don’t want to say don’t feel responsibility, because clearly, we’re responsible for what we do—but don’t feel like it’s their fault. So, one of my chapters is called, “You Suck at Savings and It’s Not Your Fault.” And I actually mean that. Surely, you are the one spending the money, so you are actually spending the money, and we can’t pretend that you’re not doing it. But at the same time, I think unlocking the appreciation and the understanding of the why. Why are you spending like this? What is causing you to spend like this? And I think there is an argument to be made that— and I know there’s a new field of financial therapists that I think are very helpful in this context—but while I think everybody should spend years plumbing the depths of the why’s on a very personal and human level, I think there are also some great shortcuts you can take that let you hack your way around some of the triggers that may cause overspending or make it difficult to start investing. And you can do that first and then you can take the time to really go deep on the why for your own personal sense of knowledge and control. But I think accepting that you may be wired a certain way is certainly one way to get out of this frozen shame/blame place that I think a lot of people are in. I heard so many people say to me, “I just don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of doing it wrong. This is really confusing. It will never work for me.” Those are all stories that loop through people’s heads that stop them from taking action.

Benz: We want to delve into some of the things that you just referenced, Anne. But first, you have two sons who are in the same age cohort as your intended audience. I’m wondering, did they influence how you approach the subject matter in the book and perhaps why you wanted to write a book geared toward this audience in the first place?

Lester: Oh, very much so. I think I say it in the acknowledgments or at the back of the book that I was very grateful for them being my focus group of two to begin with. And I think what I really learned from them is—and you read about it in the media, but certainly talking to them—I consider them reasonably media-sophisticated, engaged people. And there is a level of cynicism and skepticism about the system and what to expect from the grown-ups that is radically different. Maybe people felt like that in the ‘60s when they were that age. I’m a generation almost younger than that, so I didn’t feel that. But just this skepticism and “it will never work for me” is so pervasive. And I think some of that is obviously the environment we’re in and two pretty large systemic failures, most importantly, the great financial crisis. But also, I think when you’re young, compound returns don’t make sense. You don’t get a visceral understanding for how that works. And I do think that some of the young inability to trust that it will work, which we’ve damaged in all kinds of ways with systemic failures from leadership, and I think that’s a challenge for all of us in this society. It’s just a much lower level of trust in institutions. But specifically for the younger people, when you put money on top of it, I think it’s so difficult for your brain to understand the power of compound interest unless you’re a math geek. That math really, really, really works. It’s very powerful, but you need to let your money grow for 10 or 20 years before you really see how powerful it is. And that, I think, is an insight that I really hope people take from my book.

The single most important thing that somebody in their 20s or 30s has is time. And it is truly magic for what it will do for your future. But it’s hard to take that on faith and you have no personal experience in it until you’re out 20 years later, and then you can look back and go, “Wow, that worked,” or, “Oh, I wish I had.” I want them not to say, “I wish I had.”

Arnott: In addition to talking to your own sons, you also conducted some focus groups of younger adults to help prepare for the book. What was the purpose of those focus groups and what kinds of topics did you cover with them?

Lester: Well, I did, with the help of a company, a bunch of surveys where I really wanted just to get a sense for how people thought they were doing saving for retirement and how they actually were doing saving for retirement. So, we sent this out in the summer of 2021 and got a lot of data about savings rates and attitudes and stuff. And when we looked at it, it was very clear that people really fell into four buckets, again, aligned on this: How are you doing versus how do you think you’re doing? And it was fascinating looking at—and everybody I surveyed was between the ages of 21 and 45, all income levels, all education levels. And the group that was doing well and knew it, really skewed very heavily male and also skewed very heavily—and I really dove into this in the focus groups—I called them the cryptonauts. They were really into money. They were geeking out on the data. They were on all the social media and internet sites and giving each other tips. Again, I called them cryptonauts because that’s what was going on back then. But they were giving each other tips on day-trading and were kind of geeking out on this stuff. And the only woman in the focus group who we could recruit, because again, we were trying to match the demographics of the thousand people when we recruited the focus group. So, we got similar age, similar income distribution, and similar gender mixes. And the only woman had been taught how to do this by her grandfather, but everybody in that group had a mentor, a financial mentor, who taught them how to do it.

And then the other three groups were also fascinating. About 50% of the people were not doing well and knew it. And then the other, about 35% of the people were almost evenly split between the other two groups—the ones who were doing just fine based on their self-reported savings and investments, but thought they weren’t. So, they were the worried well—skewed very female, didn’t have a lot of mentorship, didn’t have a lot of understanding but were just really good savers. And then to me, the most interesting group from my former hat as running target-date funds, was the group that thought they were doing just fine and were not at all based on their self-reported savings, were saving way too little. And I knew this before I left J.P. Morgan. But the single scariest thing I heard them say was, “Well, we know we’re doing fine because our company enrolled us in the 401(k).” And then when we probed and said, “How much are you saving? How do you know it’s enough?” They said, “I don’t know how much I’m saving, but the company did it. So, I know it’s right.” That was answer number one. Terrifying, right? If you’re an auto-enroller and you haven’t been auto-escalating, that is terrifying.

And then the second answer that also I found troubling, especially in this sort of internet age is, “I know I’m doing everything right because I’m doing what everybody else around me is doing.” And both of those really give me pause, because if you’re gauging success on everybody else— and again, I see this now on social media—there’s a lot of really good stuff on social media about finances. But you know what? There’s also a lot of not-so-good stuff out there. And if you’re not very sophisticated about this stuff, it’s pretty hard to tell it apart sometimes. So, that is troubling. And clearly the ones either they were listening to people who were equally ill-informed, or they were listening to people who were giving them actively bad advice—and I couldn’t tell in the focus groups which one it was—but it was troublesome.

Benz: In the book, you talk about how people in their 20s and 30s today are actually pretty good savers based on the data, despite the widespread perception that they’re spenders on avocado toast and whatever else. Can you talk about that?

Lester: I haven’t seen the data on that. But my suspicion is that’s almost entirely due to auto-enrollment. And certainly, a lot of the data around this is for retirement. If you compare them to the boomers, the boomers didn’t even have 401(k) plans when they were entering the workforce, and they certainly weren’t getting auto-enrolled. So, I think for younger workers who start in a company that offers a 401(k), I’d say most of them are now getting auto-enrolled. Many of them are now getting auto-escalated. And certainly, when I talk to people in this age bracket, what I hear is,

“I’m really worried. I’m not doing it right. I’m not doing enough.”

And I say, “Are you in your 401(k) plan?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know how much?”

“I’m not sure. I think 10%. I need to check.”

And I’m like, “You’re doing OK.”

There are some things we can check. There are some things we can do. But if you’re in and started in your 25 or 30 even, you’re on the right path. So, some of that anxiety and fear is because they’re hearing it everywhere as much as actually having any, like, “I know I’m doing it wrong.” In fact, a lot of them are doing it pretty well. They just need to be reassured, frankly.

Arnott: You also talk about some of the headwinds for young adults who are just getting started with their financial lives, including the fact that the cost of college has gone up so much. What are some of the key challenges for people in this age group?

Lester: I think there’s several. One is that we’re in overall a more affluent society than certainly society was when I graduated from college in 1986. Social media makes it a lot easier to see what your peers are doing. And I think there is a bit of norm-setting that happens when you see everybody else doing it and you think you should be doing it too. It is also true that the median price of housing, whether you’re renting or buying, versus the median salary is significantly higher. The median price of a car is significantly higher versus the median salary. So, a couple of really big-ticket items that most people anchor on as signs of, “I’m an adult now because…” are really more expensive. We lose a little sight over the fact that they’re also probably a lot nicer. And some of that increase in cost is actually reflecting a much wealthier society. So, the car that you buy now is nicer and safer, the house that you buy or the apartment that you rent is probably per-square-foot bigger than what I would have gotten in my age, certainly nicer. So, it’s not quite apples to apples in terms of what you’re getting for the money. So, I think that’s just true.

And then I also think because society overall is more affluent, people are more uncomfortable struggling with stuff. I don’t want to sound like a cranky old boomer who says, “Oh, kids these days,” because it’s more than that. It really is more than that, these big-ticket items being one of them, and to get the same level of external achievement is just harder. But it’s also, I think, a more affluent society really struggling with a lifetime income curve. And it takes a while to have your salary increase to the level that you grew up with. I had this conversation with one of my kids who was saying, “I’ll never be able to afford what you and dad had.” And that may be true, especially for my child who is a musician.

He said, “We’ll never take nice trips.”

And I was like, “Honey, do you remember the vacations we took all the way through middle school?”

And he’s like, “What do you mean?”

We always used to see their great grandmother for spring break. And I said, “Remember where we stayed where dad and I used to pull the mattress off the sleeper sofa in the living room because it was so uncomfortable. We couldn’t sleep on the sofa bed, and we gave you guys the bedroom.”

And he’s like, “Yeah, I love that place.”

And I was like, “Well, let’s talk about how fancy a vacation that was.”

It wasn’t; it was like negatively fancy. Or the apartments we used to rent at the beach with no screens on the windows and mosquitoes. And they don’t remember any of that. They’re anchoring on the nicest bit of our life that happened when I was in my 50s. So, some of it, I think, is just that comparison too that people lose sight of.

But I don’t mean to derail this. I do think that because those big-ticket items, whether it’s colleges and debt, certainly starting off with debt is something that the boomers did not do to the same degree. College was just much more affordable. So, you’re starting in the hole from a debt perspective. Those big-ticket items that you view as milestone achievements are coming later because they cost more.

Benz: Anne, you mentioned the comparisons, people comparing themselves. I wonder if you can touch on the role of social media in that where it seems like younger people, especially are comparing their vacation or their wedding or their house to their peers and often coming up feeling pretty bad about themselves. So maybe you can talk about that dimension and whether that came out in your focus-group discussions.

Lester: When I was running the focus groups, what I was really curious about is where people got financial information and certainly the overwhelming source of financial information was social media. If I knew then what I know now, I would have maybe probed a little more about that sort of lifestyle anchoring and that sort of normalization of what “everybody is doing it” kind of a thing. And again, I think when you’re younger, peer influence is so important and it’s so hard to not get swept along. I just saw an article today—and I’ve been following this trend myself for the last six weeks since it kind of bubbled up—about loud budgeting and being really public about saying I’m trying to save money.

So, there’s an example of social media actually being a really healthy way to use your peer group to affirm healthy behavior and normalize not spending money because everybody else is. The article started with somebody saying, “I canceled my milestone birthday trip to London because I don’t have the money.” And I’m like, what, 30 years old and you’re taking a milestone trip to... what?? So, that’s what I was referring to before, this sort of normalization of luxury spending, I think is very attributable to social media. It used to be that you’d see Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous once a week on TV and now it’s just in your feed constantly. So, you have this aspirational level of spending normalizing things like weddings. Well, of course you have to have X, Y, Z; of course, it has to be a wedding weekend and not just an event. It just normalizes stuff. And then you see your peer group starting to do some of those things. And then suddenly it’s the new normal. So, I think that’s very detrimental. But also, some good stuff on there like the loud budgeting.

Arnott: One recurrent theme we noticed in the book is the idea of getting out of the shame spiral, not berating yourself because you didn’t start saving earlier or made some financial mistakes along the way. Was that something that came out of the focus groups that young people are beating up on themselves and maybe getting in their own way because they feel bad about previous mistakes?

Lester: Not really. I think maybe I gather that more in one-on-one conversations and maybe that’s just telling you a little bit about myself. I certainly felt that way, and I think all the research that we read about losing weight or trying to overcome habits, the script that starts playing in your head about “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t,” I think that came much more from there. But I have seen and felt and heard when I’m having one-on-one conversations with people of any age, when I mentioned that, you can just see their posture change. Somebody had tears well up in their eyes. This one young woman I was talking to when she asked me if she was doing OK, I said, “Yeah, you’re doing fine. And she actually had tears in her eyes, and she said, “Oh, thank you. I never know if I’m good enough or doing it well enough.” To some extent maybe this goes back to social media as well and maybe to some trends I’m seeing playing out just with younger people—feeling like the stakes are very high for them all the time. I don’t think I felt like that when I was their age that I have to get into the right school, I have to get the right job, I have to do this right otherwise something terrible will happen. I’m not sure what the terrible thing is. But this just constant fear of failure and stress, which just seems to be dimensionally different than I recall it being.

Benz: Do you sense that people in this age cohort feel a little more comfortable talking about money than previous generations did? And if so, do you think that’s a healthy development? You talked about how your parents didn’t talk much about money at all really at home and how that influenced your thinking a little bit as you were starting out.

Lester: I think so. I think things like the salary transparency—a woman whose name I’m blanking on on TikTok who just asked people what they’re making—and people are saying that this loud budgeting. I think it’s something I’m hearing in the financial-services community. Financial advisors are getting more comfortable asking their clients about their money stories. I think all of this is healthy. I think again because so many people feel like they should know—I hate the word should—they should know more about personal finances; they should be doing better; they should be whatever. And I think many families either feel reluctant to talk about their money because they’re worried that people will think they have a lot and they don’t want their kids talking about, look, how much money we have and bragging. Or, and I think much more commonly, feel ashamed because they are struggling with money, and they don’t want their kids to know that there are hard conversations happening. I can’t remember if I put this in the book or not and I can’t remember the stat over my head, but something like 70% of parents would rather talk about sex education with their kids than money. It’s a really high percent would rather talk about the thing we all think is really uncomfortable than talk about money. So, there’s clearly a lot of shame associated with it, otherwise we would be happy to talk about it.

Arnott: So, in the book you share a lot of helpful hacks and tips and tricks for young people who are looking to get their savings programs on track. Can you share some of those ideas?

Lester: So, the biggest one, and this is straight out of the 401(k) playbook is just automate everything. Automate the money going into the savings account, automate the investing, automate the escalation if you can, like you keep saving more and some 401(k) plans will let you do that, some won’t. It’s the single most powerful thing you can do. And then put it in a place, put your money, put your emergency savings. I think making sure it’s not really easy to see and get is also really important, and if you’re saving into an IRA or 401(k), it’s kind of hard to get back out. A, you have to do a request and it’s a thing, but also you pay these tax penalties, which is uncomfortable. So, that’s a safe place for your money longer term and in a true, true, true, true emergency—and I talk a little bit about that in the book, you can get it back, but it makes it very hard. I think having money sitting in a savings account that’s on the same home screen as your regular bank account is asking for trouble. So, getting it out of sight I think is a very powerful thing.

I think the other really important hack that I talk about is again right out of the 401(k) playbook, which is save more tomorrow. Make sure that you continue increasing the amount you save as your lifestyle gets better as you earn more money. Because if you don’t do that, you will not be saving enough. But it’s so painful to increase your savings rate today because you have to stop spending money. The younger you are, the more likely you are to see meaningful income increases as you get more experience and become more valuable as an employee, and so at least for the first 10 or 20 years of your working life you can probably count on seeing some pretty consistent increases in your salary and that’s the great way to get your savings rate up.

Benz: One mental trick that you shared in the book to help limit spending is to add a zero to whatever purchase you’re contemplating, and I thought that was such a useful way of framing it. Can you talk about that mental trick?

Lester: So, it’s really something that came about because my husband and I are serial rehabbers, and we overbuy houses that need a lot of work and then spend decades rehabbing them. So, we’re living in an old house that we spent 13 years fixing up and for a while we were looking at replacing a bunch of windows, which is really not very cheap. And I was changing the unit of money—every time I thought about spending some money, I’d say, well, that’s a window, better not do it. Having a handy thing that keeps your eye on what you’re trying to achieve is so powerful. So, we were thinking about buying—this is back in the early 2000s—buying a big screen TV, and I was like, well, that’s going to be two windows. No, we can’t, we don’t need a new TV. I want those windows. Then it was like, well, how does that translate into retirement? And I want to be able to live another six months without running out of savings. That doesn’t work. I want to be able to buy a boat. No, that doesn’t work either. And then it was like, well, it’s just how much more money is it? Because let’s assume you earn a 7% return, that money doubles every 10 years. In 30 or 40 years, it is 10 times;10 times the amount, and that’s fast math you can do.

Arnott: One of the other challenges that people face as they’re just starting out is how to prioritize building an emergency fund versus saving for retirement or paying down student loan debt. You outline a hierarchy for prioritizing those three objectives. Can you talk about that a little more?

Lester: I’ve seen people who use a similar hierarchy, I’ve seen different ones. And for me, it really boils down to—and maybe this is again coming out of my career—risk management and really avoiding the really, really bad outcomes. So, really, really bad outcomes are outcomes that push you into financial crisis or bankruptcy. So, to me the number-one priority is to really focus on building up your emergency fund because that is what’s going to keep you financially healthy, when you don’t have to run up credit card debt, when you need to replace your tires or hit a pothole—whatever the thing is, coming up with that $1,000, $2,000—you lose your job. So, emergency fund even more important than retirement.

But what if you have an employer who offers a matching 401(k) program? You also really want the free money. So, to me, if you don’t have a 401(k) plan and you only have to do this by yourself, you should just focus on your emergency savings first and then start working on your retirement savings. If you do have a 401(k) or a 403(b), or some other kind of workplace savings program, and you get matching from your employer, then you need to start working on both simultaneously. After you have at least three months of emergency fund—and again, I talk about in the book how you should think about three to six months. And if you are in a volatile industry, if you’re self-employed, if you know you’re in an economic environment that may make you more prone to a layoff, you might want to lean more toward six months. If you are a government employee and very unlikely to get fired, maybe you can do the three months. And you’re getting all of the free money from your employer. You get the full match from your employer, maybe not maxing out, maybe not at the target savings amount you want to get to, but at least getting the full match, then I think it’s very appropriate to turn your attention to paying down high interest-rate debt. So that is debt with—it’s a little bit arbitrary, like more than you would get investing the money in your 401(k) plan. I picked 8%. We could argue about is that 7%, is that 10%, but it’s 8%. You want to pay that down as fast as you can. And you want to continue making payments on the low-interest rate debt, which might be federal student loans or other kinds of debt under that 8% level. But you really want to get rid of that high interest-rate debt stuff first.

Benz: We wanted to switch over to discuss investing. I was struck by your investment recommendations in the book. You’re pretty unequivocal about keeping things simple with target-date funds or perhaps a three-index fund portfolio. I’m curious, was it liberating to be able to provide such clear-cut advice to tell people to just buy a basket of Vanguard index funds, for example, since you’re no longer working for an asset manager?

Lester: No, I don’t think so. To me, again, it goes back to how is somebody going to spend their mental and emotional energy. The first thing I recommend is target-date funds, because guess what, I used to manage target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in active management as well. It’s hard to pick active managers because, especially in US equities, most managers don’t outperform. So, it requires time and emotional energy and a process and a lot of skill. So, I just think that’s asking an enormous amount of individuals. And at the end of the book, I do go into some tips for investing and say, “Look, if you think you’ve got the time, the energy, and the skill, then go for it.” It’s fun. I did it for a long time. I think it’s fun. But most people don’t think this stuff is fun. Most people don’t have the process or the—discipline, starts putting it into judge-y territory—just the time and the energy to spend doing it in a process that they can repeat. And I think unless you’re going to do it that way, you’re really better off not doing it at all and making it as simple as possible because the payoff for the incremental amount of emotional and intellectual energy you need to spend on this is uncertain.

Arnott: Do you think there’s a tendency on Wall Street to make investing seem more complicated than it really is or needs to be? And what’s the motivation behind that?

Lester: I’ve thought this for years that one of the main challenges for the financial-services industry when we talk to our clients is that we think this stuff is fun and interesting. Because guess what? Most of America, like I said before, just wants the whole thing to go away. Just tell me I’m going to be OK and make it go away. I don’t like this. It’s uncertain. If you make me think about saving for retirement, it’s unpleasant because I’m denying myself stuff I want right now. It’s volatile. You can’t promise me it’s going to work. And oh, by the way, I’m going to die at the end of this. Why should I like this experience? There’s nothing good about it if you don’t happen to think this stuff is intellectually interesting.

So, I think a huge part of the challenge is the industry is populated with people who geek out on this stuff and sometimes struggle to understand why clients don’t share our enthusiasm. So, right out of the gate, we’re like, we’re a mismatch of the intellectual starting point and then the vocabulary that we’re using. I think some of it is regulation in that those of us who are still subject to securities licenses have to be extraordinarily precise about how we say things, which makes us sound squirrely, frankly, when we’re talking because you can’t just say stuff. You have to qualify it all the time. And then you have to use very precise language, which also is very unrelatable. And I may have told you this ages ago, Christine, back in my former life where it took us a huge amount of effort to get regulatory and compliance people to allow us to use clip art to show the risks on the target-date funds for J.P. Morgan. How about saying this is a risky investment and putting that red circle with a line through it. That is pretty clear. Well, it took us months to get them comfortable using stuff that was that obvious and every time you get some industry move toward simplifying some of this stuff, something happens, and it gets pulled back the other way. So, some of that is self-inflicted. And then, yes, I will finally say that I do think that maybe some people—I’ve seen it happen—enjoy being mysterious and knowledgeable and being seen as experts. And when you want to be seen as an expert, you tend to lean in hard to jargon and sophistication that doesn’t help somebody understand very well. But I don’t think that’s all of the story.

Benz: I want to ask about financial advice and whether in the focus groups you got any clues as to how younger age bands are thinking about financial advice. You mentioned that they have widespread skepticism about the industry and the system. But any feedback on financial advice and the willingness of younger people to hire financial advisors and pay for them?

Lester: It was a little depressing to be honest—depressing and not so depressing depending on the hat you’re wearing. So, I was actually quite encouraged to see that people were really willing to take financial advice from their parents. And I was like, really? Wow, that makes me feel better as a parent, like my kids are listening to me, I think to a greater extent than prior generations did. So, clearly, our maybe helicopter parenting is paying off in some regards. Our kids actually may listen to us a little more. But certainly, there was a very wide strand of being willing to listen to social media because I can trust my peers. And I don’t want to listen to financial-services institutions because they’re just trying to make money off me, which makes my head explode. Because it’s like, well, what do you think all those people on social media are doing? What’s their financial model? Help me to understand how you think—why are they doing this? Some people really are doing this from the bottom of the goodness of their hearts. But I think a lot of people are doing this to make money. And some of them are extremely transparent about it. So why do you trust them more than a regulated financial-services institution whose employees will go to jail if they do it wrong rather than somebody on YouTube? I don’t understand that.

This skepticism of the man and not being willing to understand how the social media ecosystem works with people being sensationalist to get clicks to sell advertising and get paid by brand management people. Or, and I think we saw this happen with the whole GameStop thing, maybe running a little pump-and-dump stuff, that’s just like, how do you think they’re making money? Why do you think they’re doing this? And that struck me as rather naive, to be honest. I was surprised at the naivety behind that. Isn’t everybody doing this somewhat motivated by money?

Arnott: So, we’ve talked a lot about the target audience for this book, younger investors in either generation Z or millennials.

Lester: If I could say younger noninvestors. The person I most hope picks this book up is somebody who doesn’t see themselves as that investor.

Arnott: That’s a great point. Thanks for clarifying that. But we’d also like to talk about parents who have young adult children or kids who are still growing up. What advice do you have for parents who are trying to help their children navigate their finances when they’re just starting out?

Lester: Aside from giving my book to their children? I mentioned this book earlier today and I thought, I need to see if it’s still in print. I don’t know. It’s a book called Money Doesn’t Grow on Trees. And I remember reading it when my kids were in preschool, maybe. And it gave such a sensible outline for—you want your kids to be able to be making good, rational financial decisions when they’re in high school. And you want to give them control over their money so that you can watch them spend money. And the author for this advocated actually having them spend clothing, all of it, besides housing, basically. And with two boys who really didn’t care what they looked like, I wasn’t willing to give them control over their clothing budget because I knew they just wouldn’t buy any. So, I have standards and they were not hitting them. But we really tried to do that.

One of the things that I really learned in my book that I knew was true from my own story, but I had been quite struck at how true it was for so many other people, just not having a place to learn about how money works. And I don’t mean investing, like becoming a stock investor. That’s great, too. And if you want to do that with your child, that’s a fabulous thing to do. But I mean really basic stuff. Like you have $10 a week in discretionary spending and depending on your own circumstances and where you live and beliefs, that might be for a middle school student that I don’t know, however old they are. But that’s your money. You decide how you spend it. Don’t ask me for anymore. Period. That is really going to teach them some lessons about money with training wheels on because you’ll be there to rescue them when something happens that takes them off the rails. And I think that that was the single most powerful thing I took away from my children.

My husband and I talked about that a lot and applied it to all kinds of things like internet usage and when do you have certain privileges? Like senior year in high school, all the boundaries have to be gone. So, you can really not discover this sophomore year, or worse yet, discover them in your first job. That’s a terrible time to figure out that you really need to do your homework. Don’t do that your first job. So that to me was the most powerful thing I could imagine. And some of that trickles through the book too. How do you put guardrails on yourself? I think if you’re a parent, how do you open conversations about money up? I think one thing that I was very conscious of in this book is how much easier it is to be vulnerable with someone if they’ve been vulnerable with you first. And that’s very much something I try to do in my book is to say, look, just because somebody’s got the expert label doesn’t mean they knew how to do everything once upon a time. And I think that can be very effective for parents.

Benz: In our remaining time, we’re hoping to mine your deep expertise in the retirement savings system. You were central to J.P. Morgan’s retirement efforts for a couple of decades. So, we wanted to talk about target-date funds, which you managed. And some of the work that you and your team did comparing target-date fund investors returns to those of retirement plan participants who were self-directed and picking their own fund from the menu. Can you talk about the findings there and what you see as the implications?

Lester: Actually, I don’t cite those directly in the book, but it certainly featured in, as you point out, my focus on simplicity. I think even professional investors get caught in the fear/greed cycle. And again, just going back to behavioral economics, there are so many triggers for assuming you’re right—having overconfidence in your views; thinking that when everything is going well, it will keep going well; feeling more confident about risking more money; investing more in higher-risk assets when everything is going well. And if you’re a professional investor, you’ve got a team of people who, A, are trained in understanding that this is the way their brains are working, and B, a whole bunch of models and rigor and peers who are working to factor that those biases into the way you actually implement decisions so that you are less likely to fall into those traps. I think when you look at that specific research we talked about—and it’s not just the work that J.P. Morgan published, but Dalbar publishes research like this every year, and Morningstar has done a lot of this research too, I should say—when you look at the way individuals trade in and out of things, whether they’re individual stocks or mutual funds in their own investment accounts or inside of 401(k) plans, they typically buy high and sell low over and over and over again, which is how you destroy wealth. Or they’re wrong risked. And by that, I mean they’re in their 60s or 70s—we saw a lot of this—and had 100% in equities, or they’re 20 and had 100% in cash. So those two things—buying high and selling low, because you buy more when it feels good and you sell when you’re worried—is the opposite of how you make money, and then just having just absolute wrong level of risk for the time horizon that you’ve got. And those two things I think are the biggest contributors to that gap you see in performance.

Arnott: You mentioned automatic enrollment and auto-escalation as both being two very positive things for younger employees just starting out. Do you think that there are other types of nudges that might help people from a behavioral standpoint?

Lester: It’s just starting now, and I don’t know if this goes into your nudge category, but certainly, the potential now to add two things, which are both coming out of the Secure legislation: to add emergency savings funds and have those be payroll-deducted is huge. And again, there has been a lot of research done on the—Brigitte Madrian and many, many others over the years—if you don’t have emergency savings, people go into their 401(k) plans and borrow more than they otherwise would, just because you want to take it as much as you can. Once you start borrowing, you tend to borrow more than you need. And if you have an emergency savings fund, you don’t tap into that. So, I think that that’s a nudge if you get automatically signed up for that emergency savings. That’s, again, so powerful because so many people don’t have emergency savings. In fact, this one young woman who was so worried about her retirement fund didn’t have any. She was contributing fabulously to her 401(k). She had no emergency savings. And I’m like, “Well, you’re doing fine for retirement, but get the match, dial that down, get your emergency savings set up because you don’t want to pull it out of your 401(k).”

And then the second one is the contributions when workers are putting stuff into student loan payoffs. I think, again, for so many people, student loans are so challenging. And the more help you can give people to feel good about paying off the student loans, the better. And I know a little bit less about this personally but seeing more financial wellness-type programs being integrated into the 401(k) system is another way to help people. I don’t know that the uptake on those is as high as it could be, and that’s going to be an interesting thing to watch as it evolves.

Benz: I wanted to ask about the retirement saving system broadly speaking. We know that younger age bands are more likely to job hop than older workers. They cycle through jobs seemingly every couple of years. So, given that young workers are changing jobs frequently, does tethering our retirement savings to our employers even make sense? Or should policymakers be contemplating something like thrift savings program for the masses that would be entirely detethered from employers?

Lester: I’m personally a huge fan of the Australian system where the employer is obligated to pick a default provider. The provider in the Australian system, the super system, is not a government provider. They’re private. They are managed by fiduciaries, not the employer. So, it’s a private provider. But the only obligation for the plan sponsor is to create a default if the individual does not choose a provider for themselves. Australia also has mandatory contributions. I also think that’s good if you want to have retirement savings for people. That’s a whole other conversation. But the individual can also choose their own provider. And if you don’t put in your provider when you get hired by a new employer, they put you in the default. But you can very easily roll these together. You can keep track of it on a single system. There’s a single dashboard in Australia that you can see everything on. And to me, that is the best of all worlds—where you’ve got a default, you’ve got a failsafe, but you also have the ability for the individual, if they choose to, to say, this is what I want. And then they can have that follow them around for their whole career. So, I think that’s incredibly powerful.

I know why it started that it was an employee benefit. That was the way our system evolved. I think in hindsight, nobody would create that system on purpose. And I think a system where you’ve got the ability to contribute to a single pool, that that pool is accessible from any employer or platform. Coming out of the industry, I do believe that a competitive, well-regulated, with appropriate oversight, private market is going to come up with innovations and probably have a more robust experience than a pure public-type system would like the federal thrift savings program. But I think there’s a lot to learn from how that works, assuming you can have the portability or the ability to tap into that wherever you want it.

Arnott: We just have a few minutes left here. We’d like to zoom out and talk a little bit about your own experience, both during retirement so far and during your career. You had a very high-profile position at J.P. Morgan and were well-regarded for your work there. We often hear that people can really feel a loss of identity when they step away from a career like that. Can you talk about whether you felt that? And if so, how did you cope with those feelings?

Lester: I didn’t feel that. Part of it is that we announced that I was leaving in March of 2020. And the world just kind of stopped revolving the following week. So, I suspect I would have felt that a little more acutely because that offboarding process would have been nine months long or whatever it was. It would have involved what would have felt like a perpetual goodbye party—I was going to go speak at conferences and visit clients and do a world tour, and all of that would have been gratifying and made me really conscious of what I was leaving. I didn’t leave anything except a really chaotic and unpleasant-sounding work situation, frankly. It just sounded really hard to navigate. And I just remember telling Dan Oldroyd, who was the person who took over and was my deputy, I just remember telling him I am so grateful I’m not in charge of any of this, sorry! I don’t have to worry about… because once you announce you’re leaving a job like I have—I was still there, and I was still engaged, and I was still part of the team, but I wasn’t actually making any decisions anymore. So, that was a wonderful, wonderful thing for me personally. I think the team did a fabulous job navigating it, but it must have been so stressful.

And then, as the pandemic was ending, I had a couple of things I knew I wanted to do when I was leaving and was very public about. One was work on this book, which took me a little longer than I thought, but here we are. And the second was to do this pilgrimage walk. I had read a book before I actually had decided to leave J.P. Morgan about the Via Francigena, which is a pilgrimage trail from Canterbury, England, to Rome. It’s a 1,000 miles. And I just remember feeling this overwhelming “I have to do this” when I read the book. And it’s the first and maybe only time in my life—I’m not particularly at all religious—but this just was such a compulsion. I have never felt that strong a compulsion to go do something. And I had planned on doing that shortly after I left, and as you know, the world did not permit me to do that because of Covid. But it turned into a real touchstone for me that I was going to do this walk and between the book and the walk, I felt like I knew what I was doing. And then the world, like I said, was just completely shut down, so I didn’t really notice that, it was like what was there to miss? Nothing. So, that also frankly helped, I think.

Benz: I wanted to ask about your career and the fact that you managed to be a very successful woman in a field that is largely male dominated. So, what are your key tips for women who are building their careers, I would say, inside or outside the financial-services industry?

Lester: I guess I’d say a couple of things, and I don’t know if it’s because I grew up with brothers or what. And I have to say I think J.P. Morgan has consistently done an extraordinary job of having very senior women. And even when I got to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, there were already very senior women there in the ‘90s. I was often the only woman in the room but very quickly that actually stopped being true. And I can remember even in the early 2000s being on all-female deal teams and walking into finals pitches and having a bunch of guys coming out and then a bunch of women going in and we were just like, “Yeah, bet we’re going to win this one.” And we did, because often HR benefits people are women, so it was quite noticeable actually.

I don’t think I ever experienced personally that in-your-face discrimination. I think I certainly did notice in meetings what you hear a lot about, and I think happens all the time, which is that you say something and then a guy says that three or four minutes later and then everybody goes, “Oh, what a great point you made, sir.” And I was like, “What, I just said that.” And I certainly have actually made deals in meetings with other women to make sure we call each other out and make sure, “Yeah, it was a great point. Anne just made it 10 minutes ago,” or whoever just made that 10 minutes ago. And that helps. I think that’s a great thing to do—find some allies and make sure that you don’t get talked over. I think the younger generation, again, is so much better at that stuff than we are.

I think another thing that I would always say to women, and I would say it to men too, but I think women especially struggle with that if they’re thinking about having children is to know what your priorities are in terms of career progression, the importance of being compensated, keeping your skills fresh. I don’t know that anybody talks about work-life balance anymore, but if you got offered the chance to do a big deal or you had a big commitment with your child, which one would you pick? There’s no right answer here. Everybody has got their own priorities for all kinds of reasons. But if you don’t know what they are, when you get confronted with a choice— and I remember this happening to me in, I guess it was 2000 when I came back from maternity leave after my second child was born—I got put on this Internet Lab Morgan project, which was a huge big deal and we were in a fun room with beanbag chairs and free food and we were going to break everything and reinvent financial services with this crazy internet stuff. This was almost 25 years ago now. So, I just found myself staying later and later at work because there was all this cool stuff, and we were all innovating, and it was really intellectually exciting. And then I just remember thinking, “Wait, I’m getting home at 7:30 pm, like, what the heck, I’ve got a 9-month-old at home. No, no, no, no, no!” And I pulled way back and accomplished a little less in that role than I might have, and it may have affected my career and I’m fine with that, because I had a priority and that was making sure I was home in time to have dinner with my baby or certainly feed him and have bath time with him and read him a story before he went to bed. I was sliding in 10-minutes-before-bedtime kind of a thing, and I just was like this is not the person I want to be. And it made that choice. I didn’t mind making the choice because I knew I was out of alignment with my values.

Benz: Well, Anne, this has been such a fun and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you so much for taking time to share your insights today. We really appreciate it.

Lester: Thank you, and it was great fun on my side, too. Thank you.

Transcript

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Ann Garcia. Ann is a certified financial planner. She’s also the author of the book How to Pay for College. She’s the managing partner of Independent Progressive Advisors, a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor in Portland, Oregon. And she’s also the author of The College Financial Lady blog. She received her BA from the University of California, Berkeley.

Ann, welcome to The Long View.

Ann Garcia: Thank you for having me.

Benz: Thanks for being here. We want to talk about your book, How to Pay for College. In the book, you relate an experience from your advice practice. You were working with an attorney. She wanted to change to a less stressful career path, but she couldn’t because she owed massive amounts of student debt. Can you discuss how that was one of the events that sparked your interest in wanting to focus on helping people make smarter decisions about paying for college and other types of higher education?

Garcia: I would say, she was an extreme example of people that I was talking with. But at the time that I had the conversation with her, and this was a woman who had gone to law school, she had taken out student loans for her undergraduate years, taken out student loans for her grad school years, she had federal loans, she had private loans, and she had even borrowed money from her family. And was really not happy as an attorney and wanted to make a career change, but she was absolutely stuck because of all of those loans. And like I said, she was an extreme example of someone I worked with. And ultimately, our plan was around planning for future insolvency for her, which is when she got to the end of her student loan debt and would have those loans forgiven, that she wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it because she would be insolvent in the IRS’ definition where your debts far exceed your assets and your ability to pay them.

And again, while she was an extreme example, I was talking to lots and lots of young adults who were coming in and interested in making plans but had so little free cash flow after their student loan payments that they were struggling to start a retirement account or even have emergency savings, to say nothing of buying homes or doing all the things that we think of as the standard building blocks of adulthood. And at the same time, there was another group of people that I felt like I was hearing from a lot, and those were parents who were struggling to figure out how they were going to pay for their children’s educations and putting it as a very high priority overall in their goals but not really having an understanding of how they were going to come up with the dollars to do it.

So, I realized that if I could help that group of parents that maybe I could reduce the number of those other young adults that I was talking to. But I would say the attorney really made it very tangible. I knew there were people out there who owed all these student loans. But sitting across the table from this woman and seeing the sense of hopelessness that she felt as a result of getting a great education was very life changing to me, because to me, education has always been a building block of opportunity, of adulthood, and to see that it was completely the opposite for her made a huge impression on me.

Ptak: In the book, you wrote that when it comes to college, no outside entity will protect you from making a terrible financial decision, and then you go on to note that you couldn’t get a mortgage for a house you could never afford, but nothing stops people from borrowing more for college than you can pay back. Why are there fewer guardrails around college outlays, do you think?

Garcia: It’s a great question. On the one hand, the federal student loan programs for students do have some pretty strict guardrails, but nothing prevents students from going and getting additional loans on the private market or parents from taking out parent PLUS Loans. And we as people tend to think that what our children want and need, and particularly the best possible version of that, is worthy of every penny that we have. And, unfortunately, no one will stop you from taking out these loans.

The way that the direct student loan, which is the loan that undergraduate students can take, is structured is, it’s the one loan that an 18-year-old can take without a co-signer, without any kind of credit history and still get a very favorable interest rate. And so, that opens up all these other issues that don’t exist in normal loans. There is no qualification for that loan other than filing the FAFSA. I firmly believe that if there were less loans available to parents, the cost of college would be much lower than it is, because I think that making all those additional dollars available and having an audience that’s willing to spend that kind of money has a huge impact on driving up the cost of college.

Benz: We want to spend some time on deciding whether loans are appropriate and also the FAFSA that you referenced, the application for financial aid. But before we get into the weeds a little bit in college funding, I want to hear about your own experience with this. You wove that in a little bit into your book. You went through the application and college-funding process not too long ago with your twins. So, I’m curious, what were some of the biggest surprises for you, a college-funding expert, as you went through that process with your two children?

Garcia: A great question. There were definitely plenty of them. As much as we can learn—we always learn there’s plenty more out there that we don’t know. So, I have twins who are currently college seniors, and they’re very, very different students. So, their two college application processes were very different. I think to me, one of the biggest surprises, given that I’m a really analytical person and I took a really analytical approach to college and encouraged my kids to see it the same way, I was surprised at how different the responses that they got from different colleges were.

So, for example, my son applied to two colleges. He applied early action to both, which is where you submit your application early, you get an answer early, but you have until the regular decision deadline to make a decision. One of the colleges replied instantly to him with an acceptance and a big scholarship offer and sent him stickers—put one on your laptop, put one on your phone. He was getting emails multiple times a week. Something would come in the mail periodically. And it was just crickets from the other school. And I thought we were going to receive two acceptances and two award letters on roughly the same schedule and be able to sit down and deliberate our way through them. But instead, he was getting this marketing onslaught from one of the colleges and hearing nothing from the other. And for a 17-year-old it was like, oh, somebody likes me and somebody else doesn’t. And it was a very challenging, emotional side of the college application process to deal with.

I think one of the really important lessons for me in going through this with my own kids is that planning for college is equal parts financial planning and parenting. Making sure that your kids understand the process, understand the budget, understand the priorities and what they’re trying to do and that you’re putting some guardrails around their decisions and around their exploration so that you can help them and coach them to good decisions in that process.

I think another big surprise for us was the number of colleges that use unweighted GPA to award merit scholarship. As you go through high school, the schools really encourage students to take higher-level courses, AP/IB, dual credit, whatever it is that the high school offers. That tends to be presented as the best choice in every circumstance. We learned from my son’s experience, where he took a lot of those classes and really struggled in them, they weren’t a good fit for him as a student. So, we were disappointed to see that the college that he chose awarded scholarships on the basis of unweighted GPA. And if we had not pushed him into all these higher-level courses, he would have been eligible for about $12,000 a year more in merit scholarships. I’m not going to say you shouldn’t challenge yourself academically or you shouldn’t take the hardest courses that are available to you. He certainly felt well-prepared as a student when he got to college. But having an extra $48,000 left over because of bigger scholarships would have been a real difference-maker for our family.

Ptak: I think you mentioned your twins are, in addition to being different people, they’re different types of students. How did you approach the college process differently with each of them?

Garcia: I was fortunate that they both wanted different things from the college process. My daughter, we felt, was a really good fit for a private college, a smaller environment, and she was very committed to not going to college around home. And so, we went out and did the whole college tour where we went and visited a whole bunch of colleges. We talked a lot about budgets and funding, because obviously, those were for the most part quite a bit more expensive than our in-state schools. But very much encouraged her to explore those options. One of the things that you find is that just the costs are so different across the board in colleges, and if you’re willing to use cost as one of the lenses that you’re looking at for college, you can find a lot of different opportunities. So, with her, we really explored a range of opportunities and saw that college was available to her at a range of different prices. And we were fortunate that her top choice school accepted her with a great financial aid package, but that involved writing a lot of essays, doing a lot of applications, applying for a lot of different scholarships so that she could close the gap between our budget and some of the colleges that she was interested in.

Our son, on the other hand, was I would say, a very typical boy. He thought school was OK. But he liked sports. He liked having a job. He liked having a girlfriend. So, high school was one of several priorities. And for him we sort of jokingly said, we’ll put as much effort into paying for college as you put into being successful in high school. So, his budget for college was what it would cost him to stay in state. We said, you can probably find some other alternatives besides this, but this is really what the budget is. And he was fortunate to find another option that had a scholarship just for someone like him.

But with my daughter, we used an essay coach to help her with her applications because there were just too many essays that she had to write. We joked it was our winter break vacation insurance just to have somebody else make sure that all got done. We had her do some test prep classes because she was applying to highly selective colleges. She took a full suite of IB classes in high school. With our son, it was the complete opposite. There was an after-school ACT prep class that was free at our high school that he signed up for. He applied to two colleges. He got into both and was perfectly happy with where that ended up.

I will say too now that they’re seniors and they’ve both gone very, very different paths in college, they have each accepted a job for when they graduate, which are virtually identical jobs but for the particular fields of study that they’re in. So, two important points there. One is, everyone can find a path that works for them. And two is, going to a highly selective school versus a highly not selective school does not have a huge impact on what the actual outcomes that the student should expect are.

Benz: I wanted to ask about that, Ann, because the data are fairly clear that going to college delivers a payoff in terms of lifetime earnings and so forth as well as something you talked about in the book: health and maybe even happiness. But where you go, what do the data say about that in terms of outcomes, life outcomes, earnings? The highly selective schools versus less-selective schools, what do we know when we look at the data on that?

Garcia: The data is pretty clear on that where you go to school really is not what’s going to determine who you are as an adult. You can look at big surveys. You can also look at things like where the Fortune 500 CEOs went to college. And the college that produced the most Fortune 500 CEOs is not Harvard, it’s not Stanford; it’s Texas A&M. Every year Rhodes scholarships are announced right before Thanksgiving, and the students who are selected represent an incredible diversity of undergraduate institutions and clearly not just the Ivy Leagues.

There was a great research project that was done a few years ago called the Purdue-Gallup report. In this survey, they surveyed adults who self-rated as successful. So, it’s not we’re only talking to people whose incomes are above X, but we’re talking to people who are themselves successful and satisfied with their lives. And it was all about figuring out how college had informed that success. What they found was there was no correlation whatsoever between what college they went to, what type of college they went to, or any of those “which college” questions about it. Really their success came down to specific experiences that they had in college. So, they were things like feeling like their professors cared about them, being able to apply what they learned in the classroom to the world at large, participating in extracurriculars, finding mentors who could help them explore life paths and whatnot. And I would say, my experience as a parent has been that both of my kids found environments where they engaged and really made the most of their four-year college experience, which is what has led them both to great career paths coming out of two really different colleges.

I encourage parents to think about why college as opposed to which college. So, there are lots and lots of good reasons for students to go to college—higher lifetime earnings. Your typical college graduate will make about $1 million total over their lifetime more than those without a college degree. Unemployment rates are much lower. But there are tons of noneconomic benefits to going to college as well. There’s lower heart disease and type 2 diabetes among college graduates than nongraduates. College graduates marry at higher rates and divorce at lower rates than noncollege graduates. So, there are all sorts of halo effects of getting a college education, none of which is dependent on which specific college you went to.

Ptak: But it will cost you, and that’s something that you talk about in your book, in which you note that the cost of attendance at public universities and private colleges increased by nearly 500% between 1986 and 2016. What are the key factors that has led the college inflation rate to be so much higher than the general inflation rate for the past several decades?

Garcia: It’s hard to point to one specific thing. It’s really a cluster of factors. You could talk about declining state funding, you could talk about increasing administrative costs and not just highly paid college presidents, but also the whole suite of support services that have been deployed across colleges to make sure that kids graduate in four years and move on to productive places in the world—nicer dorms, nicer facilities, upgraded labs, all kinds of things. I personally think that a big reason why the cost of college has gone up so much is that so many people are willing to pay the full price of college. As much as I talk to people about finding scholarships, finding ways to reduce their cost of college, budgeting for college and being realistic about what college costs, the number of people who go into the college application process expecting to pay full price for their child to attend a private school is absolutely mind boggling. And I firmly believe that if we all just decided we weren’t going to pay $80,000 a year for college, college wouldn’t cost $80,000 a year.

Benz: Well, I’m curious, Ann, who’s paying the full freight?

Garcia: Lots of families. Looking at the most selective colleges, anywhere between a quarter and a third of families are not even filing the FAFSA at all. So, they’re going into that expecting that they will pay full price. In my practice, I regularly talk to parents who say, “I know this college costs $75,000 a year, but it’s just perfect for my child and I really want to make that happen.” And it’s shocking to me. There is a large body of people out there who do believe that paying full price for college is perfectly OK.

Fortunately, it’s not the majority of people, and as a result, to fill the rest of those seats at the college, colleges are forced to discount tuition pretty substantially. One of the things that I pay attention to is what’s called the tuition discount rate, and that’s the average rate at which colleges discount their tuition. That rate is actually higher than 50% right now, which means that for every $1,000 of tuition that’s charged, less than $500 is paid. That does not mean that you will pay half of what list price is, but that does mean that if you are willing to look for colleges that offer scholarships for students like your child, you will find them. And in fact, the average net price of college has been pretty flat since the Great Recession, which means that, although published list prices are going up by about 6% a year, the actual amount that people are paying has stayed pretty flat.

Ptak: What role do you think a student’s anticipated career path, to the extent they have one, should play in determining how much to spend on college and whether to take loans to cover it?

Garcia: That’s such a good question because I know there’s that adage of don’t borrow more than your anticipated first-year salary. I would say to that 50% of students go into college undeclared and about 75% change their major over the course of their college career. So, it’s a little bit risky to say, “I’m going in as an engineer and engineers make $75,000 a year average starting salary. So, I’m fine to borrow that much and therefore, I’m going to choose XYZ college as a result.” You may end up being an engineer, but you also might not. And so, making a financial commitment on that basis is, I think, really unwise.

Again, this is me speaking as a parent. I feel like kids are under a lot of pressure when they’re in high school to know what they want to be and to know what their major is going to be and to treat college as a four-year pathway to a career versus an opportunity to really explore broadly. So, to the extent that we are coaching our kids that that’s what they should be thinking as a 16, 17-year-old when they have very little experience or visibility to the world of careers and in particular, a lot of those higher-paying initially fields like engineering, where they, again, don’t have a whole lot of direct experience with what that job looks like, what those courses look like, I think that’s really quite risky.

My recommendation to parents is always that they stick within the limits of the federal direct student loan program for their borrowing. Students who take out that loan every year will graduate from college owing somewhere upward of $27,000, depending on interest rates and how much interest has accrued, and that translates to a monthly payment of around $325 a month for 10 years. That’s an amount that a college degree will almost always cover. In fact, very few students who earn a bachelor’s degree and take out federal direct student loans, very few of them are among those groups of people who really struggle with student loans.

Benz: You talk about that in the book, Ann, who is struggling with student loans. Can you characterize those individuals? What sorts of decisions they’ve made? What sorts of career paths they’ve chosen, and so forth?

Garcia: Absolutely. I feel like, if you listen to the news, you think taking out a student loan is a one-way ticket to the poor house. And for a lot of students, student loans are the difference between going to college and not going to college. So, there’s definitely a universe where that’s an OK decision, and to me, that’s those students who take out that direct student loan and graduate with a reasonable amount.

The people who are really struggling with student loans fall into three categories. One is people who go to graduate school. With graduate school, you can borrow up to the full cost of attendance. Many students go into graduate school still owing on their undergraduate loans, and they end up like my attorney/client from years ago where the interest keeps accruing on those loans while they’re in college, and they graduate owing well into the six figures. We tend to think of doctors and attorneys when we think of those people with tons and tons of student loan debt and say, well, they’re going to have careers that will allow them to pay it off. But there are an increasing number of career paths that require advanced degrees. Social work, physical therapy in many states requires a doctorate, veterinarians. All kinds of career paths that don’t have anywhere near the salary expectations of doctors and lawyers and there are loads and loads of people who are in well over their head on student loan debt from graduate school.

Another group is people who go to college, take out loans, and then don’t graduate. So, those are people who have that student loan debt but don’t have the earnings power that goes hand in hand with having earned the degree. The third group is people who attend for-profit colleges, and those are the colleges that you hear about in the news for their predatory lending practices, they might be schools for massage therapy, or cooking schools, or places where you go to get a technical degree, where in many cases, the degree that a student earns from those colleges is not worth the paper that it’s printed on. Nonetheless, they’re allowed to take out student loans to go there, and they come out fortunate to be able to find minimum-wage-level work, but with oftentimes graduate-school-level student loan debt.

Ptak: What’s your take on whether parents should take on debt to help pay for their kids’ college? Do you think that’s ever a good idea?

Garcia: There are very limited circumstances, I would say, where that makes sense. I generally try to discourage it because most parents are in their 50s when their student comes out of college. And if you come out of college in your 50s with student loan debt and maybe still having a mortgage and trying to make your retirement catch-up contributions, something is going to fall by the wayside. I just feel like the timeline for parents to pay off student loans is really not favorable.

There are a few instances where that could make sense. For example, a parent who’s much older. I had a client whose dad was 71 when the daughter went off to college. The family didn’t have a lot of money. But because of quirks in the FAFSA formula, they weren’t eligible for the financial aid that they should have been eligible for. And in their case, what they ended up doing was having dad take out Parent Plus loans for college, get into an income-based repayment program, defer the loans as long as possible. And he’ll make a payment of about $60 a month for the rest of his life and then those loans will retire with him.

Another group of parents who might consider taking out loans are parents who are eligible for public service loan forgiveness. So, for example, a parent who’s a teacher or who works for a nonprofit, Parent Plus loans can actually be consolidated into direct consolidation loans, and then the parent can get into the income-driven repayment program and then make payments for 10 years and have the loan balance forgiven. It can be a bit of a risky strategy because the parent needs to be sure that they have at least a 10-year career path following their child’s graduation, so after they are able to consolidate those loans and go into repayment and get that forgiveness. Because otherwise, they’ll make income-driven payments and then be stuck without the forgiveness and with the larger balance that goes along with that.

Sometimes for parents who are quite young, it can make sense just because they haven’t had the earnings power maybe over the course of their child’s lifetime to save in high amounts. Sometimes families will talk about strategies that they might use, like a lower-income family, where the grandparents have a bunch of money and would be willing to help the student with college but taking that help might impact their financial aid. Sometimes those families will have the parents take out loans and the grandparents repay them once they’re graduated. But by and large, the direct student loan for students is really the best place to go for borrowing. And I tell parents too that even if the parent intends to be the one paying for college and being the one paying for the loan, it should still be the student who takes out the loan. There’s a couple reasons for that. One is that the direct student loan has the lowest fees and the lowest interest rates of all the federal loans. Another is that the student is more likely to be at an income level where their student loan interest could be deductible, and that could be roughly equivalent to one month’s payment every year, and it can help the student to build credit as well.

Benz: I want to stick with parental finances for a second longer. A perennial issue in households where parents have children is how to balance their own retirement savings alongside saving for college. I know there’s always that visceral pull on the part of so many parents to send their kids wherever their hearts desire. But what are practical strategies for parents balancing those two expensive financial goals?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a delicate balancing act too, because as you’ve seen, for a lot of parents, college is such a tangible thing and retirement is this very nebulous far off, I don’t know what that looks like, I don’t know what I want to do.

Benz: Right.

Garcia: But I do know that I want my kid to go to college in 2031. So, a couple of things. One is, I think, that we as advisors need to step away from the two most common pieces of advice that we give—one is, don’t save for college; save for retirement. You can take out loans for college, not for retirement. That’s how we ended up with a trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt. But the other thing that advisors tend to tell families is, “You want your child to go to private school, well, private school costs $80,000 a year. Inflation rate of this, times four years. That means you need to save $2,000 month every month if you want your child to be able to go to private college.” That doesn’t work for families either. So, there needs to be some sort of middle ground.

My recommendation is this: If you don’t have emergency savings, you don’t have college savings. Emergency savings should always be a family’s first priority. Families who are saving for retirement but not maxing out retirement shouldn’t contribute more than 10% of what they’re putting toward retirement into college. So, if you’re saving $10,000 a year for retirement, you should not save more than $1,000 a year for college. If you want to save more for college, then save more for retirement in addition and move those two up together. Once parents are maxing out on retirement savings, then they have more flexibility to add to their college savings. The things that families can do if they’re really not able to contribute as much as they’d like to to savings—most 529 plans have a gifting page that you can share with family and encourage them to be making contributions to that account. I also encourage families to every year on their child’s birthday look at their budget, think about who their child is becoming and who they want them to become in the future and use that as an opportunity to bump up their savings rate, even if it’s by $5 a month. The more savings you have, the more choices your child will have. There are loads and loads of pathways through college at whatever amount of savings a family has. So, certainly, if you’re not saving $2,000 a month, you have not eliminated the option of going to private school. And I say that as a parent who never contributed more than a couple of hundred dollars a month to my kids’ 529s and whose daughter is going to graduate from the world’s most expensive private college debt-free in June.

Ptak: Speaking of 529s, I think you think the 529 college savings plan is the best option for saving for college. But there’s a lot of confusion about the interplay, how savings affects financial aid eligibility. What do people need to know about that?

Garcia: And that is, I think, such a big fear for parents that if I save, I’m going to lose out on financial aid. Savings have a very negligible impact on financial aid eligibility. So, there are four components to the FAFSA’s formula for calculating expected family contribution or student aid index. It counts the parents’ income, the parents’ assets, the student’s income, and the student’s assets. The parents’ income is by far the biggest piece of that, simply because of how the formula counts the parents’ income. Any nonretirement savings that the family has, and that includes money in your checking or savings account, it includes taxable brokerage accounts, it includes 529 accounts for all the family’s children. Those are assessed at 5.64% of their value, which means that every $1,000 you have in savings costs you $56 in the financial aid formula. That puts you ahead by $944. So, yes, it will cost you a small amount in financial aid, but it will open up a world of additional choices to your child to have some savings.

Benz: I’m curious, Ann, are there any ways to think about your own household financial picture as you’re embarking on this FAFSA, which you think is really important for everyone to fill out? Any hacks that you can share to make yourself look better on FAFSA?

Garcia: So, I would say, filing the FAFSA is a lot like filing your taxes. If you wait till April 15 and just fill out the form, you’ll probably end up owing a little bit more than you would have if you had thought about it may be back in October and made some plans. The FAFSA works the same way. So, as I was saying, the biggest piece of the formula is the parents’ income. The biggest place where people put attention is the parents’ assets and that’s mostly because the assets are the only thing you can do anything about when the time comes to file it. The FAFSA uses what’s called prior year income, which means when you file the FAFSA in the fall, you’re using your most recently completed tax return, and it’s for the education year of the next year. So, it’s 2023. If I’m filing the FAFSA in the fall of 2023 to start college in the fall of 2024, I’m using my 2022 income tax return. So, that is the year that starts Jan. 1 of sophomore year and goes through Dec. 31 of junior year.

There are really limited things you can do to hack the FAFSA, game the FAFSA because of how the formula is structured. I think if you went to your manager and said please don’t pay me my December paycheck in January, please can I have that in December? Can I have that in January instead? They would say no, sorry, that’s not that’s not going to work. The biggest subtraction from your income that you have is how much you pay in taxes. So, families who are eligible for need-based aid might choose to pay more taxes in a year that counts for the FAFSA and that could mean switching your retirement contributions from pretax to Roth. That could mean pushing tax deductions into other years if you itemize. That’s really the biggest way to influence the FAFSA.

If you’re someone who has an inherited IRA where you’re taking lifetime distributions, you might increase those distributions in the years before your FAFSA income years in order to reduce the amount of distribution that you have to take in those FAFSA years. People tend to think that, oh, if I put more money into retirement, that will help me. The FAFSA doesn’t use adjusted gross income. It uses total income. So, it has you add back all of your pretax income sources. A lot of families are given the guidance that they should use a Roth IRA instead of a 529 to pay for college because they don’t report that Roth IRA as an asset on the FAFSA. The problem is that when you take the money out, you do report it as income. And every incremental dollar of income is assessed at $0.47 of its value, whereas every incremental dollar of assets is assessed at 5.6% of its value. So, not really a ton of hacks for families who have W-2 income other than putting more tax dollars into their FAFSA income years.

One thing that families tend to overlook is that student’s assets are also part of the formula. And with wages having risen as much as they have in the last few years, students often earn a lot of money over the summer—if they’re making $15 an hour working 30 hours a week for 10 weeks, that’s a pretty good amount of money that might be in their bank account still when the time comes for them to file the FAFSA. I always encourage families if the student has money that is money that’s intended for college, they can put it in the parents’ 529 and then it’s treated as a parent asset where it’s less heavily weighed in the formula.

A better strategy than trying to game the FAFSA is to first figure out if it’s even worth it. And the Department of Education has a tool on their website called the Student Aid Estimator. With a Student Aid Estimator, you can enter your family’s financial data and they’ll give you an estimate of what your expected family contribution or student aid index, which is what it will be called starting this year, what that is. If that number is higher than the cost of college, then you are not eligible for need-based financial aid and you don’t need to get into a whole bunch of games around how to file; what you’re going to do to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. Most families aren’t in that threshold. So, it certainly makes sense to do what you can to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. The other thing is, assets are a piece of it. Again, because they count for so little, you have to do some pretty big things to make them make a difference. A lot of people seem to think you have to file the FAFSA on Oct. 1. I usually encourage people to pay all their big bills before they file the FAFSA—any money that’s going to get out of your account anyway, you might as well do it before you file. So, if you can pay your property taxes before you file, if you can make an early mortgage payment. Definitely wait till after you’ve paid your mortgage and your credit card. But a lot of that really is nibbling around the edges.

Ptak: I know you said there aren’t a lot of hacks, but that was very, very educational. Thanks for that. I did want to ask you about scholarships. You note that merit scholarships are the primary means of tuition discounting. Are those based exclusively on the student’s test scores, academic performance, and other personal qualities, or do FAFSA and the family’s financial wherewithal come into play in that area too?

Garcia: It depends. There’s such a range of scholarships. To give you an example of the range of scholarships, my son has a scholarship for playing video games. Yeah, for video games, not for academics or anything else. There are some merit scholarships that have a need-based component to them. So, even families who don’t think that they’re going to be eligible for financial aid should be filing the FAFSA, because sometimes that’s a requirement to be considered for a scholarship that is a merit scholarship. By and large, the merit scholarships are based on grades, to some degree on test scores, that depends a lot on the college right now, or because the student has some other attribute that the college is interested in, such as being a good video game player.

Or alternatively, for example, a lot of the smaller private schools take a lot of pride in having students from every state. You might be the only student from your state who’s applying there, and they’re going to really want to make sure that you actually enroll and attend so they can keep saying that. Obviously, that works better for those of us from smaller states like Oregon than those of you from larger states like Illinois. But if you draw a 200-mile radius around your house and start looking for colleges that are outside that 200-mile radius, you might find that you are getting more scholarship offers than you think you are. But the majority of merit scholarships are done on the basis of grades, and the reason for that is that colleges want to attract higher-performing students because that makes them look better in the U.S. News & World Report Rankings. So, families who want to find where their student might be eligible for scholarships, there are great websites like CollegeData and College Navigator that will show you median 50 percentile GPAs and test scores for the current freshman class so that you can see if you’re above that range, you’re probably going to be eligible for a merit scholarship if that college offers merit scholarships.

Benz: You referenced those U.S. News & World Report Rankings. Can you discuss the interplay between these merit scholarships and schools’ rankings there?

Garcia: So, in case anybody still tracking, Rick Singer just got sentenced to prison. That was the guy who helped people fake their kids’ resumes and transcripts and test scores. So, the thing with the U.S. News & World Report Rankings is, colleges want to do better at them, and they want to move up in the rankings, and they use merit scholarships to attract students who will help them move up in the rankings. One of the rankings criteria is the caliber of the student body in that space, primarily now on grades, secondarily on test scores. There’s been an adjustment in the test score component of it where it used to be that colleges were downgraded if more than 10% of their students did not submit test scores. They’ve changed that. So, now, it’s if more than 50% of your students don’t submit test scores, they do get downgraded in the rankings. But U.S. News Rankings are a huge issue for colleges because so many families use them to say, oh, College X is better than College Y. And so, merit scholarships are the primary tool that colleges use to attract the students who will help them to move up in the rankings. And that’s why if your student has a GPA that’s in the upper quartile or the top quintile of the student bodies, they are probably someone that college would like to enroll.

Benz: I wanted to follow up on that, Ann, because this has come up with several of my friends’ kids where they have this conundrum about whether to reach for the higher-cost prestigious school versus going to the somewhat less-prestigious school that is much less costly because it’s awarding a lot more merit-based aid. So, how should students and their families approach that issue?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a tough area for parents to navigate. I would say that as a society we have a tendency to equate cost and exclusivity with quality. And yet, you look at college and it’s a very subjective experience. When I look at my own two kids who are twins, each of them is thriving in the environment that they’re in, and each of them is thriving in an environment that’s very different from where their twin is. And I don’t think that either one of them would be successful if they were to change places.

I think it’s really important for parents to focus on what environments—academically and socially and financially—what types of environments is there student likely to succeed in? One of the things that my daughter loved about her college when we went to visit it, is they said, every dorm is divided into houses, so you have a small group of around 100 students who are in your house, and every house has its own table in the dining commons where they sit to each. And she said, oh my gosh, not having lunch table drama would be so amazing. My son wanted the big college, football Saturdays’ experience. He craved the anonymity of a big school after toiling in the shadows of his far more academically successful sister for the previous 18 years. I think success is so subjective. Going back to that Purdue-Gallup study, where is your student going to engage, where are they going to find mentors, where are they going to find projects that fit for them? Those are the things that lead to success, not the name on your diploma. College makes you a more educated version of yourself. It’s not what creates yourself.

Ptak: We asked you about hacks before. We’re going to try again. Maybe you can share some hacks that high school students and their families should consider to improve their eligibility for merit scholarships.

Garcia: I think, the best thing for students to do is to look close to home. Have that be your starting point. Every college and career center has a big list of scholarships that are available to you. So, this is looking at the outside scholarships for merit scholarships. So, look at those, talk to teachers, talk to coaches, ask them what scholarships you should be looking at. On the institutional side, a really great starting point is looking at your in-state colleges and seeing what their merit awards are and what criteria they’re granted on. So, we always think of merit scholarships as being part of the private school landscape. They’re also a big part of the public school landscape. Look at what scholarships are offered and who gets them. Typically, at public schools, there are a range of scholarships that you will automatically get as long as your GPA is above a certain threshold. So, look at that. Look at that early in your high school career so that you are tracking toward that GPA, so that you are choosing your courses on that basis. It was a big learning to us that a lot of schools use unweighted GPA in awarding scholarships. And had we looked into that a little earlier, we would have gotten a lot more scholarship dollars.

The other thing to look at is many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, the good news is, simply submitting your college application and your FAFSA and CSS Profile if you’re applying to a school that needs them is going to put you in the running for a lot of the scholarships that the college offers. Many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, for example, when my daughter was looking at colleges, she had a budget. We did the net price calculators for all the schools that she looked at to see what our likely cost would be. And one of the colleges she was interested in was above our cost. She went back to their website and found out there was another scholarship she could apply for that would bring her cost down to where it would fit in our budget. So, that one made our list.

Speaking of which, the best hack for families getting started is the net price calculator at the college. So, every college is required to have one of these. It’s a tool where you input your financial, and sometimes your academic, information, and it will tell you what students like you received financial aid on average in the current academic year. They’re not foolproof, and they’re not a guarantee of what you’re going to get. I will say that, in our case, every actual award that my daughter got was within $2,000 of what the net price calculator had told us it would be. So, those are a great indication of what a college is likely to cost you.

Above and beyond that, lots and lots of departments within the college have their own sets of scholarships that they offer. We have a friend whose son is studying meteorology and that being a small major, lots and lots of colleges had dollars available for meteorology students, and I was like, well, that’s nice for Myles, but what about for Alex and Gabby, my kids, who did not have such specific interests? And we found the business school has scholarships for students. A lot of private colleges offer scholarships to students who live within a small radius of where they attend, or students whose parents are police officers or firefighters. So, do your homework on the schools to find out what they offer, because oftentimes the most expensive schools on paper are not the most expensive schools in reality. My daughter goes to, as I said, the most expensive school on Earth, but it was her second-cheapest choice once she got her aid package, and that’s not at all atypical. So, do the net price calculators, look at the scholarship page on the school, and then look for outside scholarships. And for those, look close to home. Ask teachers, ask your employer about any scholarships that they have. My daughter’s computer science teacher in high school had recommended that she apply for a scholarship, which she ended up getting and it’s been $5,000 a year, plus she got a computer one year and then every year since then she’s gotten $1,000 to spend on technology. She also got a professional mentor who helped her land an internship that has led to a full-time job offer when she graduates, and that all came from a high school teacher.

Benz: Sounds like a good scholarship. I wanted to ask about applying because you go into some detail about figuring out where to apply. It’s stunning how many schools kids seem to be applying to. But how many schools should students apply to? And also, what sort of diversity should students and their families look for in terms of the types of college that they apply to? You have some guidance in the book on that.

Garcia: It’s so easy with the Common App to just add more colleges to your list. Because in many cases, it’s just checking a box and sending your application. It costs about $100 for every school that you apply to, particularly if they are private schools, because you’re sending the CSS Profile and probably some test scores in addition to paying an application fee. So, first and foremost, you should give your student an application budget and make sure that all the colleges fit within that budget. In my book, I have a worksheet for students to track the colleges that they’re interested in and thinking of applying to.

One of the things with private colleges is they typically require three essays each. One of them is the Common App standard essay. But then, they will typically have two additional essays that you will have to write a specific essay for that school. So, as you add colleges to your list, not only are you adding cost and check boxes on the Common App, but you’re also adding work for your student, work in writing essays, work in figuring out what letters of rec you need because some colleges also require the letters of rec to be from specific types of teachers versus the general population. There may be scholarships that the student is applying for that have additional applications. And much as you want your child to have this unlimited universe of choices, you also want them to be present for their senior year of high school. And if all they’re doing is writing college application essays, they will not be present in other aspects of their life.

So, my recommendation for families is always, number one, find a financial safety school that belongs on your list. That’s probably some flavor of in-state public school. It may be alternate pathways like free community college. So, once you’ve identified at least one safety school, you want to make sure that you have a good body of schools that your student is going to be accepted to. And then, include some reach schools if you want. With my family, we used a couple of tools to narrow down our list. One was the net price calculators. So, every college that my daughter was interested in, we did the net price calculator. If it came out to above a certain number, that college was automatically off of our list unless she could find a pathway through other scholarships that weren’t included there that would get you there. And then, we did the exercise of why would you go there. And so, we went through every college she was looking at and said, why would you go there? So, if you got accepted to all of these colleges, to every college you applied to, which one would you choose? And she had two colleges that she said she’d have a hard time choosing between. And then, we went through this exercise of, OK, if you didn’t get into those two, what would be the next one that you’d want to go to? Which one from this group that we’re pretty sure that you’re going to get into would you choose? So, we went through that exercise and got her down to a list of about eight schools that she applied to. Even applying to eight colleges, she still had to write 24 essays, and not all of them were specific for the schools; some were for scholarships, some were for other things. So, you definitely want to manage your student’s workload. If you can’t figure out a reason why you would actually attend that college, then just don’t apply. But do make sure that you have financial safety schools as well as admission safety schools on your list.

I would think students shouldn’t apply to more than 10 schools. I think I said my son applied to two and he was fine with that and had all the choices that he wanted. So, you also shouldn’t feel like you have to apply to a lot of schools. In terms of diversity of schools, I would say the criteria for diversity to me—you should apply to some big schools and some small schools. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a big school. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a small school. You don’t need to arbitrarily apply to a lot of different types of schools. But you should apply to several schools that you’re very confident that you’ll get into where you’re in that top quartile academically, schools that accept more than 10% of applicants, you should apply to some schools that you absolutely know that you can afford, and you apply to some schools that you love if there’s a path to making them work for your family financially.

Ptak: Last question we wanted to ask you is, reflecting on all that you’ve learned personally and in your research about the college funding and application process, what are the key things you’d like to see changed to make it work better for students and their families?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s hard to narrow it down to a few things. One of the challenges about the college process is just how opaque it is, and so transparency would be a big thing. But I think the bigger issue beyond transparency is the complexity of all the pieces. The FAFSA is really complex and even despite simplification it will still be complex. And it’s especially complex for first-generation students and low-income students, the people who need the resources that the FAFSA provides the most. So, I would like to see that truly simplified. To me, truly simplifying the FAFSA is things like if you’re eligible for free and reduced lunch in high school, you should be eligible for a Pell Grant without filing the FAFSA and your expected family contribution should be a certain number that’s somewhere within the range of Pell eligibility.

I’d also like to see as parents focus more on what’s best for our children instead of what’s best in the eyes of U.S. News & World Report. College is like youth sports on steroids. When you hear parents talking about where their child is applying, where they’ve been accepted, where they’re going—I have a kid who’s going to a very unselective school, and he’s had a great experience and he has a great job coming out of it. Not only that, but he’s succeeded in ways that have surprised me and I’m just thrilled with the person that he’s become at this college. I have another child who’s done really well at a different school. But if we as parents focus more on what makes our children successful academically and socially and what works for us financially and use that as a guide to our college choices, I think that will decomplexify the system a whole lot.

I think one of the areas where we really fall short is our lack of public policy support for education, and by that I mean not just dollars for education, but actual support for education. As a society, we need more nurses and engineers and yet getting into nursing school is like getting into Harvard. Our educational system should be supporting our societal needs much better than it has and not just by making loans and small grants available for students. So, it shouldn’t be as difficult as it is to get into a degree path for a field that we have massive shortages around. But that’s a function of having a higher level of public policy support than we have and having colleges focused on serving the larger community, the larger society, as opposed to primarily the students who are enrolled at their institution.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is personal finance expert and author Ramit Sethi. Ramit's first book "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" published in 2009 was a best-seller. The new edition of the book came out last year. Ramit is the founder of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com and Earnable, an online course created to help entrepreneurs start and accelerate their businesses. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford.

Ramit, welcome to The Long View.

Ramit Sethi: Thanks for having me.

Benz: We're really excited to have you here. Your book is called "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich."" You also are in charge of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com. In the book rich doesn't simply mean amassing a lot of assets. How do you define it?

Sethi: Well, one of the key insights of my work over the last 16 years has been that rich is quite different for each of us. And interestingly, rich might be your ability to go out and buy $1,000 cashmere sweater. Great. No problem with that at all. Go for it. For others, it might be being able to pick up your son or daughter from school at 3 pm. That's also a rich life. But one of the things that I like to do when I start off talking about money with people, I don't talk about compound interest, I don't talk about asset allocation. I start off by asking people what their rich life is. And it is absolutely fascinating how people respond to that question.

Ptak: One concept you discuss is called the money dial. What does that mean? And what are some examples?

Sethi: Well, this was the exercise that I created when I wanted to help people understand what they actually want to do with their money. Interestingly, when you ask people, what is your rich life, they almost always give you the same three answers. The first one is freedom. I want to do what I want, when I want. Then sometimes they will say, I want to be able to pay off my debt. That's sort of a dim dream, I think. If your only goal is to get to zero, that's not very motivational for people. And then, finally, you have people who talk about their third point with money and what their rich life is, is very vague when you ask that question.

So, when I push them on what their rich life is, what do you want, suddenly, things change. And the way that I did this was I asked them, what do you love spending money on, love, not like love? And everybody's eyes light up. They start smiling. Everybody's got one thing. The most common answers here are eating out. That's number one. Second is health and wellness. And the third travel, okay. After that there's a steep decline. But there are a variety of different categories. Mine happens to be convenience.

And then, I asked them a question like this, I say, what if you could quadruple your spending? What would it look like and what would it feel like? And this is really a pivotal moment for people. Because most people have never thought about spending more on the things they love. They've actually only been berated to spend less on everything. When you ask them what it would look and feel like to spend more on eating out, they typically have the same response. Well, I'd probably have to go on a diet because I eat out four times a week. But I push them gently. And I remember speaking to a young man in DC while I was on a book tour. And he said the same thing about going on a diet. And I said, really? What would you do if you could quadruple the amount you spend? And he started looking off into space. And he finally said, I have a list of every Michelin starred restaurant in town, I would go there. And I leaned in, I said, who would you take with you? And he said, my family because they've never been able to afford to go to those places. That is a money dial. That is what turning up that dial can look like. And once you know what you want to spend money extravagantly on, then you can cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't care about.

Benz: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. How do the boring old financial jobs fit into this framework like, you know, saving for retirement or building an emergency fund? Retirement security is probably never going to be anyone's money dial, but it has to be done, right? So, how do you fit the two things together, the sort of more aspirational vision for your life alongside the things that you know you have to do?

Sethi: Well, I've worked with millions of people through my website, through my newsletters, social media, books and tours. My conclusion also based on my work in psychology and behavioral change, is that we want to start and meet people where they are. And I find that the minute anyone starts talking about money, whether it's in a financial advisor's office or reading a 401(k) brochure, they're already on defense, because most people don't know about personal finance, but they know enough to know that they're doing something wrong. And that's not a good sign to help them absorb and learn and make moves.

So, if it were up to me and I were advising financial advisors on their primary first conversation, there would be no math allowed, there would be no compound interest, there would be no words like estate allowed. Not at all. The questions are human questions that you might ask your children or your friends or parents. What's important to you, what do you want to do with your life? What does your rich life look like? What if you could spend more on that? These are questions that any person can answer, and they actually want to answer it. People desperately want to talk about their dreams. But until we get that down and set some foundational context for what their vision is of their future, then no amount of interest rates and returns and expense ratios are going to matter.

And I can tell you that many of us have experienced with people who end up in their 60s, let's say, they have some money, but they have no idea what to do. No idea what to do with it. They saved and they did all the right things, but they forgot the most important thing, which is to have a reason why. I remember I was having dinner with somebody in their 60s. And I asked him, if you could go back and give yourself advice in your 20s, what would you tell yourself? Any thought about it for a second? And he said, save more. I would have saved more. And I happen to know his financial situation. He's done fine. He has money. I said, if you'd save more, what would you have done with the extra money? You've got money now. What would you have done with some extra? And he looked at me stumped. It is reflexive. It's almost religious in our culture to save money. Now, that doesn't mean we do it. There's just words around and there's all these commercials out there telling people save and invest in 401(k) and this and that. Doesn't mean we do it. But what we lack is asking people why, what do they want to do and pushing them on it, not accepting the first typically lazy answer, I want to do what I want, when I want. Well, what is that? When you get into that, then suddenly people are much more receptive to these foundational concerns of retirement and tax-advantaged investing, et cetera.

Ptak: I had a couple practical follow-ups. One is defining a rich life that can vary from member to member of a household. And so, the question is how to reconcile between those definitions? And then, also, I would imagine that the definition of rich life is not static. It does change over time. And so, how should one navigate that as well?

Sethi: There absolutely are seasons in life that change. I want to start with that question because I love that one. And one of the things that I observe is the financial-services industry focusing primarily on getting people ready for the rich life in people's 60s and beyond. That's the reason I started I Will Teach You to Be Rich. Nobody was speaking to people of my age at the time I was in college and nobody was talking about the things we wanted to do. We wanted to go out. I wanted to be able to buy around and drinks for my friends. That was a rich life to me. Certainly, it was not thinking about estate planning at age 20. And also, getting advice from people who look and sound like you is profoundly important, that representation really matters.

Of course, over time, those change. We know that there are pivotal moments when people have a family, when they get a new job, potentially if they get divorced, of course, retirement. Those change over time. What is interesting is encouraging people, I think, to seize those seasons and really push it to the limit in whatever season you're in. For example, if you are in--let's just use your 20s for example. Of course, you should save for retirement. And of course, compounding matters more than ever in your 20s. You have a massive opportunity. But there's also opportunities to do things that you cannot do in your 40s, things like take a very long, extended trip. And so, that is part of a financial plan, too. It might not show up in a spreadsheet, but it's part of a rich life. And I find that people are much more receptive when you talk to them and acknowledge the season of life that they are in. You're in your 20s, you want to take a month-and-a-half to go to Europe? Awesome. Let's talk about how to make that happen. Yeah, okay, there'll be some trade-offs. But if you look at this and you decide looking back 20 years from now, would you regret not going? Sounds like it's the right call for you. Okay?

Of course, now, as for the spouse question, or partner question, oh, that's a tricky one. And I really, really love this. I have some first-hand experience being married. And we started off with different money lenses. And that was extremely challenging. And over time, I've been very thankful and grateful that I've been able to go through it on a personal level as well. One thing that I recommend in Chapter 9 of my book, when two people sit down to talk about money, usually it devolves into how could you spend so much on coffee and these sort of $3 questions, when in reality, most people should be asking $30,000 questions.

My advice is, if you are sitting down for the first time to really have a series of money conversations, again, we're not talking math in the first, second, maybe even third meeting, we're talking about how were you raised around money, what'd your parents say at the dinner table? What's your first memory? What's something you've changed your mind about with money since you were a kid? Just really getting into it. And of course, being vulnerable yourself. The other more tactical advice that I give is, when you set your first savings goal together, make it fun. What's a trip we want to go on together? What's an experience we want to create? Let's save for that. Because money then becomes a source of pleasure, not simply a source of beratement or feeling bad about yourself.

Benz: You reference that people spend too much time on the $3 questions and they should be thinking about the $30,000 questions. So, what are those $30,000 questions?

Sethi: Negotiating your salary, making sure you're working at the right job. That's a skill. It's not purely luck. You can learn how to navigate the career space. And you can learn how to negotiate salaries. We routinely teach people how to negotiate $10,000 or $20,000, salary increases. Asset allocation, that's a big win. That matters far more than any amount of lattes you could ever buy. Your fees, the fees that you were paying. Of course, we know the importance of fees as investors and yet, think about how much time we spend, whether it'd be cutting coupons or rate-chasing as opposed to really evaluating once a year, are we paying the proper fees for the advice we're getting, not just financially, but in all different parts of our life.

Your relationship, that's a big win. That's a big financial win as well, making sure that you have the right relationship, and that you are aligned on your spending. And also, another big win, your earning. So, this is something that I think is typical more of my millennial readers, people in their 20s and 30s. They are increasingly looking at additional ways to make income beyond their job. Many of them have jobs, but many of them are using, whether it's our programs, or they're doing it on their own, to start a business, started on the side, eventually, maybe even go full time. And we have many multiple six-figure earners, we also have folks who are making an extra $5,000 a month, or even $500, and that's quite meaningful. So, there are approximately 5 to 10 big wins in life and a big win, if you get that right, you never have to worry about appetizers or lattes again.

Ptak: How do you apply this ethos to people that are dealing with issues of income security and also uncertainty around healthcare security? I know that they would have their own definition of rich life, but I would tend to think that it's going to be a very, very pragmatic definition. And so, can you take what you've been describing and apply it to those types of situations as well?

Sethi: Yeah, and I'm so glad you asked about that, because I do believe in personal responsibility and I do believe in educating ourselves and making what we can with the situation that we are given. But I also believe that there needs to be systemic reform, and there are some serious structural issues that go on. So, it's one thing to say, Hey, you know, make a debt payoff plan and try to earn more. That's great, and you should do that. But if you are one step away from going bankrupt because of healthcare laws, that's not acceptable, especially in the United States of America. Now, as for practical and more tactical advice, I find that 95% of the people I talk to who are in debt do not know how much debt they actually hold. Why would they? It's a painful number to reckon with. So, it's easier to simply not open up that envelope.

The second thing is that 99% of them do not have a debt payoff plan. They don't even know how much they owe; how could they know when it's going to be paid off? The simplest and really most effective thing that you can do if you're in debt is to get all your payments together. If you don't even know how much you owe and who you owe it to, call them up and make those companies do the work for you. How much do I owe? What's my balance? What's my interest rate? And what is my current debt payoff date, if I go, as I've currently been going. Then you can work with these companies, whether it's a credit card company, student loan company, car loan. And there are many people--I remember speaking to somebody who is in $350,000 of student loan debt. That's crushing. That's crushing. And thanks to some recent laws, that's also nondischargeable. He found that with tweaking his payments a little bit paying an extra 50 to $100, which he could manage, he could shave off years of that debt payoff plan.

So, there certainly are things you can do. There are no silver bullets. There is no magic script that you can use. You can negotiate down APRs on your credit card. A lot of people don't know that. And some of these debtors actually do want to help you out. But the larger key is making a plan and then automating the execution of that so that it is not dependent on any motivation or inspiration every day. That is the way that you can slowly, methodically and healthily pay off that debt.

Benz: You've called traditional budgeting pointless. Why is that? And what's a better way to get in touch with how you're spending?

Sethi: Well, most people don't do it. And they don't want to do it. So, it's pointless and ineffective. Because if we simply look at the efficacy, it just doesn't work. Who wants to look at how much they spent last month, knowing that they probably overspent and then having to reckon with that? It's like people don't like to get a cavity taken out. It's like, do you want to do that every month? And then also correlate that with how poorly you ate and why you're causing yourself to get cavities? No, we don't want to do that. So, we don't, and guess what, life goes on. That's how most Americans live. They don't have a budget, and life goes on. It's fine until one day, it's not. And I wanted to change that for a long time.

When I started writing my blog in 2004 and eventually went on to write a book, I purchased many of the other personal finance books out there. And what I discovered was in Chapter 1, many I would say most of the other money books start off by saying, let's find out how much you spent last month. And that's a great way for people to politely close the book and say, No, thank you, I'm going to put that right back on the bookshelf. Nobody wants to do it. So, instead, I wanted to create a more forward-looking plan.

Yeah, let's look at the past. Let's analyze what we spent for the last roughly four weeks. It's not going to be perfect, but it's 85% of the way there. More importantly, let's plan out where we want our money to go. So, blank slate. If you could have your money go anywhere, where would it go? Now, it's really fascinating. If you ask the average person who's not educated in personal finances at all, they actually have no idea about some of these basic rules. They don't know 28-36. They don't know 10% for savings or investments. They don't know these numbers. And that's okay. So, they start off with this idea that's not particularly sophisticated. But what I did was with the help of my community and the millions of people who've been reading, I figured out how much people typically are spending on fixed expenses, et cetera. And when you give people a benchmark and you explain why, suddenly they realize, okay, I can make that work. And sometimes when they can't, I can't really afford to put 10% in savings. Okay, what am I going to do? Well, you know what, I can do 7% this year, and then I'm going to focus on increasing my salary and my car payment is going to end. So, I'll be able to do that next year. Okay, great.

People are very, very comfortable once they have a benchmark of saying, look, I may not be able to hit it perfectly, but I'm generally on track and that makes me feel good. That is so profoundly different from look at a spreadsheet full of things you spent on last month and then figure out what to do about it. That's like it's empty. You're throwing people into a national park and saying, make your way out of here. It's impossible, it's very difficult. So, instead, what I want to do a conscious spending plan, look forward, decide where you want your money to go. Here are some benchmarks that are very helpful. And if you can hit these, you are good. You don't have to worry about anything else. Just hit these basic numbers of savings and investment and the rest is guilt-free spending. You could spend it on whatever you want.

Ptak: So, how do you think that the pandemic has affected the way some of those you work with have set their conscious spending plans? I would have to think that they would be revisiting some aspects of those plans, just given the way circumstances have intervened. And so, can you talk a little bit about maybe what sort of changes you've been making in consultation with clients and whether you've revisited any aspects of your framework in light of what we've experienced?

Sethi: Yes, it's a great question. I have. As soon as the pandemic happened, I decided to make some very rapid changes. And first, my wife and I left the city. We left it pretty early on, and even so early that our friends were like, what are you doing, and maybe it's I've watched too many Batman movies and I've seen bad things happening in cities. I said, we should get out of here. So that was first thing was taking care of my family. Second thing was taking care of my team. So, we initiated a COVID stipend for anyone who needed additional funding for whatever reason, groceries, for their parents, or their family or themselves. And then, we also initiated a debt freeze, or a payment freeze, I should say, for any of our customers. So, we have tens of thousands of customers. Anyone who needed to put their payments on hold, we initiated that proactively, no problem. And then, we raised a bunch of money for Feeding America and other organizations.

Finally, when I spoke to my readers, looking at the economy, as it got worse and worse, I did make one change. I recommended that they increase their emergency fund savings from six months to 12 months. Now, that is quite aggressive. And the reflexive response for some was, that's crazy, you're telling me that I should stop investing, so I can put money in a savings account that's basically losing money. I find that interestingly a lot of people who really should be the beneficiaries of being financially conservative take unnecessary risks. In truth, the extra return you might get for a few months of savings in the grand scheme of your life, it's not really that big. But having the safety and security of a six- to 12-month emergency fund can truly be a lifesaver if your job or entire industry goes away. So, I did advise them on that.

The other thing that I recommended was a three-part framework. And that framework is first play defense. So, get your 12-month emergency fund in order. If you've got that, next, continue your investing plan as usual. We know that it's not about timing the market, it's time in the market. And then, finally, go on offense. If you have done defense, and you've continued that you still have money, which a lot of people do, although it's not really palatable to talk about it publicly, go on offense, look for opportunities, whether it's starting a business, many of my Earnable students have done that, whether it's looking for investment opportunities, whether it's simply writing a big check to a charity or a family member that needs it. Go on offense and use your money in a meaningful way. That's a three-part framework that I have adapted based on COVID. And it's really helped people understand what to do in a time like this.

Benz: You referenced the importance of having an emergency fund and enlarging it potentially at this time. Do you like the idea of automating that for people like maybe embedding that in terms of workplace retirement savings, where they have an option to save short term in some fashion as well? Seems like people really struggle with getting their emergency funds together.

Sethi: Yes, I mean, I'm a huge fan of automation, in any and all regard. So, when I was back in college, studying human behavior and psychology and technology, and just looking at what happens, for example, when firms introduced automated 401(k) contributions, right? You could spend the next 50 years educating people about tax advantages, or you can simply make 401(k) opt out. Make it automatic, boom, compliance jumps above 90%. And so, the more we can automate these things, the better. And I think this is a really important point for anyone in the financial-services industries.

Let's remember this. nobody really cares about being a financial expert. I want to say it again, because it's so important. Nobody cares about being a financial expert. They don't want to. This is really important. All they want is for their money to go to the right places and for them to be safe and okay. That's it. And so, we make a profound mistake when we give people a 300-page document and a Monte Carlo analysis. We say, here you go, there you go, that's your life. Nobody cares. You would think they would care because they claim that money is the most important, but they care in the way that they can approach it. And that is why when I talk about money, whether it's on Instagram--like yesterday when I talked about some myths about raising taxes on the rich, I used examples that resonate with them. If they want to read the math, I can talk about the math. But most people want to be approached with their money in a way that resonates with them.

So, for automation, most people do not want to manually go and transfer things. They may want the outcome of that. Of course, they want a nice savings account that's growing. But every month, they're motivated month one, month two, okay, they'll do it, month three, they got something else going on. It's, I think, a sign of humility and understanding when we acknowledge we are imperfect as human beings. And that doesn't mean we're bad. It simply means that we should use systems to make up for our flaws. If you tried to get me to manually invest every single month, I'd probably do it three, four, five, six months in a row, maybe month seven, I would forget. I know that. I acknowledge that. That's a human weakness. So, I set up automation. And the more we can do that for ordinary and frankly, sophisticated people, the better, because people are more than happy to tweak the system once or twice if they know that it's going to provide ongoing benefits. It's when you demand people pay attention for the rest of their lives to something that becomes very difficult for people to actually adhere to it.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to one of the three elements that you mentioned in your framework, which is this notion of going on offense, which I think is very intriguing, and I think actually will hold an appeal to a lot of people. But at the same time, the pandemic can be a difficult environment in which to make big life choices. And so, how have you worked with those that you work with, to help them navigate that making sure that if they are going to make a big life choice, they're doing so in the correct state of mind, knowing how much pressure, I suppose, we're all under right now, given the environment.

Sethi: In order to make these big life choices, I intentionally made that the last step in the framework. I don't want somebody who has no emergency fund, who has one month of investments, suddenly deciding that they want to pack up, move, try some crazy investment, change jobs. I don't want that. It's risk upon risk upon risk, it's too much. So, therefore, I intentionally advise people first play defense. I want that emergency fund up. Second, I want you to continue your investing plan. If you don't have an investing plan, now is the time. Go read my book or read any other book. And then, third, and only if you've done those other two things, then you have earned the right to play at this level. This is a methodical approach. But when I share why, people intuitively get it.

We all know that when we were kids, we earned the right to watch TV after we finished our homework. We've known this principle since we were children. It's only though as adults that we want everything all at once. And there's really nobody to tell us no. Because of the trust I build up with my readers over the last 16 years, I tell them what I believe, I tell them exactly what I'm doing. I tell them the accounts that I use, the banks that I love, the banks that I hate. I'm very, very transparent with them. And I even tell them that people like me, I should be taxed more. And they've never heard somebody talk like that. Wow, somebody who's actually advocating for himself to be taxed more. What? So, they know that they're here and it's straight, whatever I tell them. And thanks to my business model, I create products, they buy it, if they find value, they keep them. So, it's a very straightforward aligned business model. We don't do commissions or anything like that.

And so, when somebody like me says, look, you got to earn the right to be able to play at that level, they understand that. And so, although it might be a little unpalatable, Oh, I have to focus on savings for the next six months, that's so boring, it's earning nothing in my bank account. They understand there's a bigger picture. And they remember, we always start with what is your rich life. So, whether it's traveling five-star resorts, or whether it's going to taking six months off to go build houses in a different country or even here in America, they understand that we are working toward each of our rich lives. That's why they are willing to take it step-by-step as opposed to trying to jump to the more advanced stuff right off the bat.

Benz: So, it seems like the financial-services industry is really warming up to this idea of helping clients align their finances with their aspirations and their life goals. But I guess some of it strikes me as kind of marketing spin. So, if I'm a consumer and I'm attempting to discern, like who's good at this and who is just trying to get money so that they can manage it, how do I figure that out?

Sethi: Well, Christine, I'm absolutely shocked that you would accuse the financial-services industry of pure marketing. I am shocked that you would say that. How could you? Yes, it's true. I think, overall, it's a good thing that the financial-services industry is realigning to focus on what people want, what they actually need. I think there are some really interesting business model challenges. I've spoken to several advisors who I really like and respect. And they point out, I think, quite accurately that what's more valuable to the client is behavioral advice. However, most people are not really willing to pay for that. And so, that's certainly a challenge going forward.

I will say that, in my opinion, the financial-services industry should be advocating first and foremost for their clients to be put first. I think the reflexive arguments against the fiduciary rule are nonsensical. I mean, it's actually unbelievable some of the stuff that I saw in the press. Some firms and companies claiming that if they have to be fiduciaries and put their clients first, fewer Americans will get good financial advice, because they can't afford to give it to them. They actually put that in writing. I can't believe it. What type of industry or firm would actually say that publicly? With that said, the advisors who stand out are the ones, in my opinion, who are of course, putting their client first. But that's really just table stakes. They're connecting with them in interesting and engaging ways. They're writing content, they're also creating their own methodologies of how to reach people, and how to connect with them. In other words, they're not starting off by talking about what is your retirement goal? That's not their first question in the first meeting or the first day at all. They're talking about what's your life like, tell me about it. What would you do differently?

So, yeah, there is some element of marketing. I agree. Again, financial services is known for that. But in general, I do want ordinary Americans to have access to great information about money. And personally, I just wish things were a little easier. I've spent 20 years studying money, understanding it, doing it on my own, helping millions of people. You shouldn't have to do that to get good at money, you really shouldn't. Things should largely go well if you do a few basic things. You should automatically be contributing to your 401(k). You should automatically have a savings account. You should automatically understand, do I have enough, is getting a house actually a good decision for me, et cetera. And that, of course, involves a combination of financial services and products; it involves systemic change, government role, and of course, individual responsibility as well.

Ptak: That all sounds like sensible advice. My question would be do those who are trying to achieve some of the goals that you described need a financial advisor, and if they determine they do, should they be paying them 1% of the assets under advisement to get the help that they need?

Sethi: Well, I'm going to tell you what I tell my readers. I tell them that the majority of people do not need a financial advisor, you can do this on your own. And I show them exactly what to do. I show them funds, I show them asset allocation, I show them automation, even down to the level of this is the date on which your transfer should happen from this account to that. Once they set it up, I found over the course of millions of people using my material, they're quite good and quite confident at it. That's fantastic.

Now, there are certain reasons to hire an advisor. And I've been very explicit about what those reasons are and how to hire a good advisor. Also, I've hired an advisor myself, okay? I fit one of those rules, which was I wanted a second set of eyes, a temporary second set of eyes on my investment plan. And I think that depending on how large your portfolio is, or how complex your situation is, for example, you might be in a second marriage, you might have multiple children going to college, you might be starting to think about downshifting retirement. Those are all pivotal moments where you may say, you know what, I'd like to get a second set of eyes, just make sure I haven't missed anything big.

So, there are reasons that you may want to hire an advisor. The average American, I advise them, you can do this yourself, you can certainly get started yourself. And I have to emphasize why I say that. I don't think we should delegate one of the most important things in our life. And this is not the same as delegating your oil being changed or your lawn being mowed or even going out to a restaurant having somebody cook for you. This is profoundly deep. It cuts across everything you and potentially your spouse do.

So, when you ask people in their 40s, what are you worried about? And the primary answer is always the same, money, this tells you, it's got to be something that you yourself are tackling. You're getting in there, rolling up your sleeves and doing it, and you can. As for the people who do hire an advisor for a temporary second set of eyes, or they want a plan, that's fine. I show them how they should interview five different advisors, they should, of course, get along with them, ask them if they're a fiduciary. They should pay an hourly rate. I'm happy if people pay a high hourly rate. Premium service, premium prices, I'm all good with that. They should not pay a 1% fee. I do not support that at all. And I've been very clear about why that is. There's no reason that an ordinary investor should be paying an assets under management fee. As we know from the research, those fees do not produce better returns in investing or in behavioral response either. And so, pay an hourly rate. Even if the hourly rate is high, great, pay it. In the short term, it might seem expensive; in the long term, anything is cheaper than 1% AUM.

Benz: You've recommended robo-advisors for people who need help with their investments. Would target-date funds be a worthy solution as well, especially for people who are just kind of getting their financial footing?

Sethi: I love target-date funds. They're my favorite investment. And I highly recommend them. They're great, because they're simple. They are one investment. They're automatically diversified and automatically rebalanced. I can't recommend them enough to people. And it's funny--when you speak to beginning investors, they've been taught through media, movies that you have to pick stocks and you've got to have big multiple screens with green letters running across. They're almost skeptical when you tell them. No, it's actually just one fund. That's it. And all you need to do is set it up to automatically invest, and you're done. And when you tell them that you should actually be spending less than 60 minutes a month on your finances, they almost don't believe you. The irony is, they're drawn to the more complex, because it seems mysterious. But in actuality, once you get really good at something, you learn that really the crux of success in that field is typically very, very simple. Same with investing, right? Automatic investing consistently, low fees and focus on the long term. It's really simple, almost too simple.

Ptak: Maybe we can talk about what seems like the antithesis of that, which is brokerage accounts like Robinhood, which had become popular among young investors just starting out. The question is, is this a good way for young people to get started investing, in your opinion?

Sethi: No, nobody should be using Robinhood. It makes zero sense. It's toxic for young people in particular, who are now being trained from day one to believe that investing is about randomly picking individual stocks. And I would be willing to bet--in fact, I would be willing to bet a large amount of money that early Robinhood investors will have lower lifetime earnings and lower lifetime investment returns than the average Vanguard investor.

Benz: I want to talk about homeownership. You have argued that many people overemphasize homeownership as a component of a successful financial life. And it's definitely hard to argue that homes are always great investments, but they are the largest source of wealth for many households. And they're also I guess, as an illiquid asset, something that people can stick with, and not tap for short-term needs and so forth. So, I guess, how does homeownership fit in? How do you suggest that people approach that?

Sethi: Yeah, this has been a really interesting conversation that I've had with my readers over the years. My big advice for people when it comes to buying a house is that I want them to run the numbers. It seems so simple and innocent. Of course, Ramit, we'll run the numbers. But as I've dug deeper into it, I've discovered so many things about buying a house. In this country, real estate is religion. And we grow up being taught these phrases like you're throwing money away on rent, don't pay your landlord's mortgage, or they're not building more land. And so, people grow up without really thinking about it. But eventually ""knowing"" that they should buy a house, and this is so funny. You hear people talking about this. One of the favorite things on the Internet is to complain about how expensive weddings are. No matter what if you write about weddings, somebody's coming out, popping out of the comments section and saying, oh my god, you spent that much? Well, I spent $52 and we sort of hot tamales at our wedding and we're still married 30 years later. That's such a waste of money. And people will then say, yeah, we could have taken that money and bought a house with it. Notice that the wedding and the house are always tied together.

Now, where do you think that came from? You have people who are largely financially unsophisticated. You never hear folks talking about investing, target-date funds, dollar-cost averaging. But suddenly, when it comes to a wedding, they're talking about, oh, we would just prefer to just put that down for a down payment. Where'd that come from? And the answer is that there's been a systematic marketing campaign from The National Association of Realtors. The government and of course, our parents, who bought houses, telling us that you need to buy a house. That's the best investment there is.

When I started to dig into this, I became extremely fascinated because if you actually truly run the total cost, you include what I call the Phantom costs of buying a house and you compare it to investing in an S&P 500 fund, you will often find that housing is not a great investment. Not always, but a lot of times. I have lived in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. I've rented in all of those by choice. It would have made no financial sense for me to buy. I want to say that again because it is so counterintuitive. It still makes no financial sense for me to buy. And I could buy right now. So, I'm a renter by choice. I'm sure one day I will buy. I'm also sure that when I do, I'm sure the house is going to be great. I'm also sure it's probably going to be a terrible financial decision.

What happens is you have somebody saying, you know, my grandma bought a house in Texas in 1970 for $200,000 and she just sold it for $600,000. She made $400,000 of pure profit. But of course, if we dig into the numbers and we look at how much she spent on maintenance and taxes and interest and then we compare all that plus your down payment to what you could have made by just simply investing in a S&P 500 fund for 0.1%, you often find that people could have made much more by renting, key being they need to invest the difference. That's a big, big key.

My point with this is not to tell people that buying a house is a bad decision. That's not my point. Like I said, I will buy a house someday. My point is that a rich life involves deep thinking about your big decisions and buying a house is perhaps the biggest financial decision for most people. I don't want people going into it unknowingly. I don't want them getting charged crazy fees on their investments. I don't want them investing in things that are not properly diversified and I don't want them buying something that for a lot of people ends up making them house poor and because of the way that all the fees are levied and obscured, they don't actually realize, wow, this house is costing me a lot more than I thought.

So, I'm giving people permission, run the numbers, question what you've been told about buying a house. It may be right for you, or it may not. But you should never feel pushed into a large financial decision. You should get clear on the difference between what is a luxury purchase and what is an investment. And you should get educated about all of your different options because you have lots of options to grow your money. And if you want to use housing, that's fine. Understand the trade-offs. If you want to do a target-date fund, great. If you want to do all the above, great. But I don't want somebody using phrases that they were taught when they were seven years old--don't throw money away on rent. That's not what I want. I want my I Will Teach You to Be Rich readers and everybody listening, take the unconventional choice, run the numbers, decide what is right for you and your rich life. I have found that to be very, very rewarding.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to an earlier question on Robinhood specifically, but maybe we will widen it out to the concept of learning by doing and specifically, learning by making mistakes. And I guess, it's sort of tied in with the you only live once sort of ethos, right, YOLO. And I know that one of the defenses that some have mounted for things like Robinhood is that you kind of get it out of your system and you learn from some of those mistakes. And so, maybe to broaden out in your experience, is that important or really should we focus more on precisely defining what is truly important to us in leading a rich life and try to minimize mistakes like those?

Sethi: Everyone's going to make mistakes. I made them myself. When I started off investing as a teenager, my dad helped me open up a custodial IRA and I thought that investing meant picking stocks. So, I picked three random stocks. Two of them went bankrupt. And I quickly learned I didn't know what I was talking about and I spent the next few years really learning about money and testing my approaches on myself and then slowly with my readers. I never hold it against anyone if they make mistakes, particularly when they're starting off. Hey, you know you're going to get an overdraft fee. Okay, great. Use the script in Chapter 1, get that reversed. Hey, you might pick the wrong account. No big deal. Let's fix it while it's small because soon your numbers are going to get quite large and those mistakes can be costly.

If people were to join a service like Robinhood with the mindset of, you know what, I'm going to experiment with this for three months. I'm going to allocate $1,000 and that's what I'm using to invest. And then, at the end, that's it. That's my cap. Great. That's not what's happening. If you look at people in forums and subreddits discussing this, that is not what's happening at all. We have people leveraging. We have people borrowing. We have people who are surrounding themselves in an echo chamber of others who are encouraging day-trading. And long-term sophisticated investors know that net-net these folks are going to lose money. What's even worse, they're going to create bad financial habits that I argue will last the rest of their lives.

So, it's no problem to make mistakes. We're all going to make mistakes at any age, at any level of sophistication, but there are certain things that are so dangerous that we should be extremely careful about trying without clear rules and guidelines for ourselves and this is one of them.

Benz: We've had a couple of guests from the FIRE movement on the podcast, and sometimes I see your perspective being cast as sort of the opposite of FIRE. Is that your view? Are you anti-FIRE?

Sethi: No, I'm not anti-FIRE. I know a lot of the FIRE folks and I think the FIRE community is especially interesting. First off, anything that gets Americans to increase their savings rate in general I think is a good thing, okay? Personally, I do not encourage extreme frugality. And one of the principles that I share with I Will Teach You to Be Rich is live life outside the spreadsheet. Meaning, at a certain point you've won the game. You already know your early retirement date, or you've already accumulated enough to retire at whatever age you want. Fine, great. Congratulations. At that stage, get out of the spreadsheet. Running another analysis and tweaking your portfolio by 0.01% is not going to change anything.

With the FIRE community, one thing that I've encouraged when I did another podcast with Mad Fientist was what are you going to use the money for. And if your answer is, I want to do what I want when I want, that's not an answer for someone that has spent years optimizing for the next step of life. My encouragement with I Will Teach You to Be Rich and my approach is, let's start living that life now. There are things that many of us have experienced, friends or parents, who get to a certain age, they have big plans and then something happens. They get struck by an illness. Something unexpected happens and they simply can't do it. That's the last thing I want for my readers. There are also certain things that you can't simply start older in life. It's more difficult. Folks often on some of these subreddits are talking about, you know, when I retire, I want to learn a different language and I want to travel and this and that. Awesome. I love it. But all we need to do is look at the last two years of anyone's life to have a fairly good predictor of what they're going to do in the next two years of life. If you've been traveling now, you're probably going to travel more later. If you haven't, I would say it's unlikely that you're going to dramatically change your life in retirement.

I heard a very fascinating principle related to early retirement, et cetera, which was a relative of mine said, we really have 20 years of peak spending--not talking about saving, talking about spending--40 to 60. Now, we can disagree on what those numbers might be. But he said, look, early on, you don't have any money, fine. But at a certain point, whether it be health reasons or interest reasons or family reasons, you're not going to go on a backpacking trip around Europe when you're 78. So, you have these peak 20 years to spend. Now, let's make sure, of course, we don't run out of money, of course. Let's also be as intentional about spending. What are the seasons of life that I'm in right now? What's important to me? Is it children? Is it my spouse? Is it my family? Is it charity? Is it a venture? Let's really dial in on those. Knowing we have a finite amount of time and we should spend as much time on that as we do tweaking our investments and tracking our spending and running a Monte Carlo analysis.

So, I have no problem with the FIRE community. I love anybody that encourages us to think deeply about what our rich life is and increase our savings rates. I do think that money alone is not a rich life. You can have $1 million; you can have $10 million. That's just a number in a spreadsheet. What you do with it, that is when you truly craft and create your rich life.

(Please stay tuned for important disclosure information at the conclusion of this episode.)

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Amy Arnott: And I’m Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Anne Lester. She’s author of a new book called Your Best Financial Life: Save Smart Now for the Future You Want. Before writing the book, Anne spent 20 years as head of retirement solutions for J.P. Morgan. With AARP, she co-founded The Aspen Leadership Forum on Retirement Savings. In 2020, Anne was recognized for her extraordinary lifetime contributions to Americans’ economic security with the Ray Lillywhite Award. She earned a master’s in international economics and Japan studies from Johns Hopkins University and a B.A. from Princeton. She was also awarded a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship.

Anne, welcome to The Long View.

Anne Lester: Well, thank you so much for having me.

Benz: Well, we’re excited to have you here and congratulations on the book, Your Best Financial Life. Maybe you can talk about your motivation for writing the book.

Lester: Thanks so much. I think there were a couple of different things motivating me. I guess for starters, I’ve always wanted to write a book and in fact have an unpublished novel I wrote in my 20s and 30s in the bottom of a desk drawer somewhere. So, it’s been a lifelong ambition. I guess I listened to the “write what you know” advice. So, I certainly know this topic pretty well. And I know it from several different perspectives. One, obviously as an investment professional who spent 20-plus years focusing on how to build investment products for people to help them save for retirement. But also from a very personal perspective, I found a lot of what I was learning about is I really dove into the defined-contribution system very personal because I was a textbook example of all of the mistakes people make when they’re trying to save themselves— maybe not so much on the investing side, but certainly on the saving side. So I think I’m writing this book maybe for my younger self, but also very much for my children and for frankly, everybody I talked to along the way, working on this book who really is struggling often to overcome not just the realities of saving, which are challenging, but also their own personal feelings of maybe shame and fear and the little voice in their head that says, you should do a better job at this. So that’s why I wrote the book.

Arnott: So, I think you partially answered our next question, which is why did you focus your book on a younger audience, mainly millennials and Gen Z versus people who are getting ready to retire or already retired, for example.

Lester: Again, there are multiple reasons, but a big one is—and I don’t mean this to discourage anybody who is older—but if you’re in your 50s or 60s and have not started saving yet, it’s a really different conversation than it is with a 30-year-old who hasn’t started saving yet. And so, part of it is just—I don’t want to say easy because none of this is easy—but it’s a less challenging, maybe less sacrificial conversation when you’re younger because you do have time. And time is your friend when you’re in your 20s and 30s. When you’re in your 50s and 60s, time is, from an investing perspective, certainly much less of a friend. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons. The other reason is, again with children this age, I hear and see so much—I don’t know, nihilism or fear or “we’ll never be able to do it.” And I just don’t think that’s true. So, another one was really trying to dispel that fear.

Benz: It seems like a lot of people have tried to crack this nut with books and websites, trying to help younger people with their financial wellness. And I’m wondering if you can think about what you view as your “secret sauce” or what are you trying to do differently than other entities that have tried to address the same audience and the same general topic?

Lester: Well, clearly, we’re not getting it right because I don’t think the savings rates—the proof is in the pudding and it’s not all that great. And as you say, there are many, many, many books out there like this. I think I’m trying to do two things that are maybe a little different. The first is, approach it—it’s basically integrating the behavioral, the why with the how. And I think there are lots of books on the why and a lot of books that take a deep dive into the behavioral economics and the importance of it for personal finance. But I don’t know that many books have successfully integrated the why of the wiring and the how you do it as explicitly as I’ve done. So that’s one big differentiator.

The second big differentiator is I think—and I am one of them—financial-services professionals tend to get stuck in jargon. I think we assume that this stuff is interesting. And I think most people don’t find it the least little bit interesting. They just want it all to go away, and I think they can, without intending to, sound condescending. And so, I really tried very hard to sound approachable, relatable, human, not to use jargon, but also, and I think there are plenty of great books that have come out very recently aimed at this demographic written by people this age, I think those books are a, “Hey, I’ve done it all right and I can teach you to do it, too.” I’m taking kind of a different approach, which was, “Wow, I made every mistake you made, and I’ve learned a lot. And let me share that with you from the perspective of someone who has made the mistakes and learned, but also from the perspective of someone who spent 30 years as a professional investor.” And so, I think that’s a bit differentiated as well.

Arnott: What are some of the key areas where you depart from the conventional wisdom about how this group of younger investors should be managing their finances?

Lester: I think at a high level, I am trying very hard to make sure that people don’t feel—I don’t want to say don’t feel responsibility, because clearly, we’re responsible for what we do—but don’t feel like it’s their fault. So, one of my chapters is called, “You Suck at Savings and It’s Not Your Fault.” And I actually mean that. Surely, you are the one spending the money, so you are actually spending the money, and we can’t pretend that you’re not doing it. But at the same time, I think unlocking the appreciation and the understanding of the why. Why are you spending like this? What is causing you to spend like this? And I think there is an argument to be made that— and I know there’s a new field of financial therapists that I think are very helpful in this context—but while I think everybody should spend years plumbing the depths of the why’s on a very personal and human level, I think there are also some great shortcuts you can take that let you hack your way around some of the triggers that may cause overspending or make it difficult to start investing. And you can do that first and then you can take the time to really go deep on the why for your own personal sense of knowledge and control. But I think accepting that you may be wired a certain way is certainly one way to get out of this frozen shame/blame place that I think a lot of people are in. I heard so many people say to me, “I just don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of doing it wrong. This is really confusing. It will never work for me.” Those are all stories that loop through people’s heads that stop them from taking action.

Benz: We want to delve into some of the things that you just referenced, Anne. But first, you have two sons who are in the same age cohort as your intended audience. I’m wondering, did they influence how you approach the subject matter in the book and perhaps why you wanted to write a book geared toward this audience in the first place?

Lester: Oh, very much so. I think I say it in the acknowledgments or at the back of the book that I was very grateful for them being my focus group of two to begin with. And I think what I really learned from them is—and you read about it in the media, but certainly talking to them—I consider them reasonably media-sophisticated, engaged people. And there is a level of cynicism and skepticism about the system and what to expect from the grown-ups that is radically different. Maybe people felt like that in the ‘60s when they were that age. I’m a generation almost younger than that, so I didn’t feel that. But just this skepticism and “it will never work for me” is so pervasive. And I think some of that is obviously the environment we’re in and two pretty large systemic failures, most importantly, the great financial crisis. But also, I think when you’re young, compound returns don’t make sense. You don’t get a visceral understanding for how that works. And I do think that some of the young inability to trust that it will work, which we’ve damaged in all kinds of ways with systemic failures from leadership, and I think that’s a challenge for all of us in this society. It’s just a much lower level of trust in institutions. But specifically for the younger people, when you put money on top of it, I think it’s so difficult for your brain to understand the power of compound interest unless you’re a math geek. That math really, really, really works. It’s very powerful, but you need to let your money grow for 10 or 20 years before you really see how powerful it is. And that, I think, is an insight that I really hope people take from my book.

The single most important thing that somebody in their 20s or 30s has is time. And it is truly magic for what it will do for your future. But it’s hard to take that on faith and you have no personal experience in it until you’re out 20 years later, and then you can look back and go, “Wow, that worked,” or, “Oh, I wish I had.” I want them not to say, “I wish I had.”

Arnott: In addition to talking to your own sons, you also conducted some focus groups of younger adults to help prepare for the book. What was the purpose of those focus groups and what kinds of topics did you cover with them?

Lester: Well, I did, with the help of a company, a bunch of surveys where I really wanted just to get a sense for how people thought they were doing saving for retirement and how they actually were doing saving for retirement. So, we sent this out in the summer of 2021 and got a lot of data about savings rates and attitudes and stuff. And when we looked at it, it was very clear that people really fell into four buckets, again, aligned on this: How are you doing versus how do you think you’re doing? And it was fascinating looking at—and everybody I surveyed was between the ages of 21 and 45, all income levels, all education levels. And the group that was doing well and knew it, really skewed very heavily male and also skewed very heavily—and I really dove into this in the focus groups—I called them the cryptonauts. They were really into money. They were geeking out on the data. They were on all the social media and internet sites and giving each other tips. Again, I called them cryptonauts because that’s what was going on back then. But they were giving each other tips on day-trading and were kind of geeking out on this stuff. And the only woman in the focus group who we could recruit, because again, we were trying to match the demographics of the thousand people when we recruited the focus group. So, we got similar age, similar income distribution, and similar gender mixes. And the only woman had been taught how to do this by her grandfather, but everybody in that group had a mentor, a financial mentor, who taught them how to do it.

And then the other three groups were also fascinating. About 50% of the people were not doing well and knew it. And then the other, about 35% of the people were almost evenly split between the other two groups—the ones who were doing just fine based on their self-reported savings and investments, but thought they weren’t. So, they were the worried well—skewed very female, didn’t have a lot of mentorship, didn’t have a lot of understanding but were just really good savers. And then to me, the most interesting group from my former hat as running target-date funds, was the group that thought they were doing just fine and were not at all based on their self-reported savings, were saving way too little. And I knew this before I left J.P. Morgan. But the single scariest thing I heard them say was, “Well, we know we’re doing fine because our company enrolled us in the 401(k).” And then when we probed and said, “How much are you saving? How do you know it’s enough?” They said, “I don’t know how much I’m saving, but the company did it. So, I know it’s right.” That was answer number one. Terrifying, right? If you’re an auto-enroller and you haven’t been auto-escalating, that is terrifying.

And then the second answer that also I found troubling, especially in this sort of internet age is, “I know I’m doing everything right because I’m doing what everybody else around me is doing.” And both of those really give me pause, because if you’re gauging success on everybody else— and again, I see this now on social media—there’s a lot of really good stuff on social media about finances. But you know what? There’s also a lot of not-so-good stuff out there. And if you’re not very sophisticated about this stuff, it’s pretty hard to tell it apart sometimes. So, that is troubling. And clearly the ones either they were listening to people who were equally ill-informed, or they were listening to people who were giving them actively bad advice—and I couldn’t tell in the focus groups which one it was—but it was troublesome.

Benz: In the book, you talk about how people in their 20s and 30s today are actually pretty good savers based on the data, despite the widespread perception that they’re spenders on avocado toast and whatever else. Can you talk about that?

Lester: I haven’t seen the data on that. But my suspicion is that’s almost entirely due to auto-enrollment. And certainly, a lot of the data around this is for retirement. If you compare them to the boomers, the boomers didn’t even have 401(k) plans when they were entering the workforce, and they certainly weren’t getting auto-enrolled. So, I think for younger workers who start in a company that offers a 401(k), I’d say most of them are now getting auto-enrolled. Many of them are now getting auto-escalated. And certainly, when I talk to people in this age bracket, what I hear is,

“I’m really worried. I’m not doing it right. I’m not doing enough.”

And I say, “Are you in your 401(k) plan?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know how much?”

“I’m not sure. I think 10%. I need to check.”

And I’m like, “You’re doing OK.”

There are some things we can check. There are some things we can do. But if you’re in and started in your 25 or 30 even, you’re on the right path. So, some of that anxiety and fear is because they’re hearing it everywhere as much as actually having any, like, “I know I’m doing it wrong.” In fact, a lot of them are doing it pretty well. They just need to be reassured, frankly.

Arnott: You also talk about some of the headwinds for young adults who are just getting started with their financial lives, including the fact that the cost of college has gone up so much. What are some of the key challenges for people in this age group?

Lester: I think there’s several. One is that we’re in overall a more affluent society than certainly society was when I graduated from college in 1986. Social media makes it a lot easier to see what your peers are doing. And I think there is a bit of norm-setting that happens when you see everybody else doing it and you think you should be doing it too. It is also true that the median price of housing, whether you’re renting or buying, versus the median salary is significantly higher. The median price of a car is significantly higher versus the median salary. So, a couple of really big-ticket items that most people anchor on as signs of, “I’m an adult now because…” are really more expensive. We lose a little sight over the fact that they’re also probably a lot nicer. And some of that increase in cost is actually reflecting a much wealthier society. So, the car that you buy now is nicer and safer, the house that you buy or the apartment that you rent is probably per-square-foot bigger than what I would have gotten in my age, certainly nicer. So, it’s not quite apples to apples in terms of what you’re getting for the money. So, I think that’s just true.

And then I also think because society overall is more affluent, people are more uncomfortable struggling with stuff. I don’t want to sound like a cranky old boomer who says, “Oh, kids these days,” because it’s more than that. It really is more than that, these big-ticket items being one of them, and to get the same level of external achievement is just harder. But it’s also, I think, a more affluent society really struggling with a lifetime income curve. And it takes a while to have your salary increase to the level that you grew up with. I had this conversation with one of my kids who was saying, “I’ll never be able to afford what you and dad had.” And that may be true, especially for my child who is a musician.

He said, “We’ll never take nice trips.”

And I was like, “Honey, do you remember the vacations we took all the way through middle school?”

And he’s like, “What do you mean?”

We always used to see their great grandmother for spring break. And I said, “Remember where we stayed where dad and I used to pull the mattress off the sleeper sofa in the living room because it was so uncomfortable. We couldn’t sleep on the sofa bed, and we gave you guys the bedroom.”

And he’s like, “Yeah, I love that place.”

And I was like, “Well, let’s talk about how fancy a vacation that was.”

It wasn’t; it was like negatively fancy. Or the apartments we used to rent at the beach with no screens on the windows and mosquitoes. And they don’t remember any of that. They’re anchoring on the nicest bit of our life that happened when I was in my 50s. So, some of it, I think, is just that comparison too that people lose sight of.

But I don’t mean to derail this. I do think that because those big-ticket items, whether it’s colleges and debt, certainly starting off with debt is something that the boomers did not do to the same degree. College was just much more affordable. So, you’re starting in the hole from a debt perspective. Those big-ticket items that you view as milestone achievements are coming later because they cost more.

Benz: Anne, you mentioned the comparisons, people comparing themselves. I wonder if you can touch on the role of social media in that where it seems like younger people, especially are comparing their vacation or their wedding or their house to their peers and often coming up feeling pretty bad about themselves. So maybe you can talk about that dimension and whether that came out in your focus-group discussions.

Lester: When I was running the focus groups, what I was really curious about is where people got financial information and certainly the overwhelming source of financial information was social media. If I knew then what I know now, I would have maybe probed a little more about that sort of lifestyle anchoring and that sort of normalization of what “everybody is doing it” kind of a thing. And again, I think when you’re younger, peer influence is so important and it’s so hard to not get swept along. I just saw an article today—and I’ve been following this trend myself for the last six weeks since it kind of bubbled up—about loud budgeting and being really public about saying I’m trying to save money.

So, there’s an example of social media actually being a really healthy way to use your peer group to affirm healthy behavior and normalize not spending money because everybody else is. The article started with somebody saying, “I canceled my milestone birthday trip to London because I don’t have the money.” And I’m like, what, 30 years old and you’re taking a milestone trip to... what?? So, that’s what I was referring to before, this sort of normalization of luxury spending, I think is very attributable to social media. It used to be that you’d see Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous once a week on TV and now it’s just in your feed constantly. So, you have this aspirational level of spending normalizing things like weddings. Well, of course you have to have X, Y, Z; of course, it has to be a wedding weekend and not just an event. It just normalizes stuff. And then you see your peer group starting to do some of those things. And then suddenly it’s the new normal. So, I think that’s very detrimental. But also, some good stuff on there like the loud budgeting.

Arnott: One recurrent theme we noticed in the book is the idea of getting out of the shame spiral, not berating yourself because you didn’t start saving earlier or made some financial mistakes along the way. Was that something that came out of the focus groups that young people are beating up on themselves and maybe getting in their own way because they feel bad about previous mistakes?

Lester: Not really. I think maybe I gather that more in one-on-one conversations and maybe that’s just telling you a little bit about myself. I certainly felt that way, and I think all the research that we read about losing weight or trying to overcome habits, the script that starts playing in your head about “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t,” I think that came much more from there. But I have seen and felt and heard when I’m having one-on-one conversations with people of any age, when I mentioned that, you can just see their posture change. Somebody had tears well up in their eyes. This one young woman I was talking to when she asked me if she was doing OK, I said, “Yeah, you’re doing fine. And she actually had tears in her eyes, and she said, “Oh, thank you. I never know if I’m good enough or doing it well enough.” To some extent maybe this goes back to social media as well and maybe to some trends I’m seeing playing out just with younger people—feeling like the stakes are very high for them all the time. I don’t think I felt like that when I was their age that I have to get into the right school, I have to get the right job, I have to do this right otherwise something terrible will happen. I’m not sure what the terrible thing is. But this just constant fear of failure and stress, which just seems to be dimensionally different than I recall it being.

Benz: Do you sense that people in this age cohort feel a little more comfortable talking about money than previous generations did? And if so, do you think that’s a healthy development? You talked about how your parents didn’t talk much about money at all really at home and how that influenced your thinking a little bit as you were starting out.

Lester: I think so. I think things like the salary transparency—a woman whose name I’m blanking on on TikTok who just asked people what they’re making—and people are saying that this loud budgeting. I think it’s something I’m hearing in the financial-services community. Financial advisors are getting more comfortable asking their clients about their money stories. I think all of this is healthy. I think again because so many people feel like they should know—I hate the word should—they should know more about personal finances; they should be doing better; they should be whatever. And I think many families either feel reluctant to talk about their money because they’re worried that people will think they have a lot and they don’t want their kids talking about, look, how much money we have and bragging. Or, and I think much more commonly, feel ashamed because they are struggling with money, and they don’t want their kids to know that there are hard conversations happening. I can’t remember if I put this in the book or not and I can’t remember the stat over my head, but something like 70% of parents would rather talk about sex education with their kids than money. It’s a really high percent would rather talk about the thing we all think is really uncomfortable than talk about money. So, there’s clearly a lot of shame associated with it, otherwise we would be happy to talk about it.

Arnott: So, in the book you share a lot of helpful hacks and tips and tricks for young people who are looking to get their savings programs on track. Can you share some of those ideas?

Lester: So, the biggest one, and this is straight out of the 401(k) playbook is just automate everything. Automate the money going into the savings account, automate the investing, automate the escalation if you can, like you keep saving more and some 401(k) plans will let you do that, some won’t. It’s the single most powerful thing you can do. And then put it in a place, put your money, put your emergency savings. I think making sure it’s not really easy to see and get is also really important, and if you’re saving into an IRA or 401(k), it’s kind of hard to get back out. A, you have to do a request and it’s a thing, but also you pay these tax penalties, which is uncomfortable. So, that’s a safe place for your money longer term and in a true, true, true, true emergency—and I talk a little bit about that in the book, you can get it back, but it makes it very hard. I think having money sitting in a savings account that’s on the same home screen as your regular bank account is asking for trouble. So, getting it out of sight I think is a very powerful thing.

I think the other really important hack that I talk about is again right out of the 401(k) playbook, which is save more tomorrow. Make sure that you continue increasing the amount you save as your lifestyle gets better as you earn more money. Because if you don’t do that, you will not be saving enough. But it’s so painful to increase your savings rate today because you have to stop spending money. The younger you are, the more likely you are to see meaningful income increases as you get more experience and become more valuable as an employee, and so at least for the first 10 or 20 years of your working life you can probably count on seeing some pretty consistent increases in your salary and that’s the great way to get your savings rate up.

Benz: One mental trick that you shared in the book to help limit spending is to add a zero to whatever purchase you’re contemplating, and I thought that was such a useful way of framing it. Can you talk about that mental trick?

Lester: So, it’s really something that came about because my husband and I are serial rehabbers, and we overbuy houses that need a lot of work and then spend decades rehabbing them. So, we’re living in an old house that we spent 13 years fixing up and for a while we were looking at replacing a bunch of windows, which is really not very cheap. And I was changing the unit of money—every time I thought about spending some money, I’d say, well, that’s a window, better not do it. Having a handy thing that keeps your eye on what you’re trying to achieve is so powerful. So, we were thinking about buying—this is back in the early 2000s—buying a big screen TV, and I was like, well, that’s going to be two windows. No, we can’t, we don’t need a new TV. I want those windows. Then it was like, well, how does that translate into retirement? And I want to be able to live another six months without running out of savings. That doesn’t work. I want to be able to buy a boat. No, that doesn’t work either. And then it was like, well, it’s just how much more money is it? Because let’s assume you earn a 7% return, that money doubles every 10 years. In 30 or 40 years, it is 10 times;10 times the amount, and that’s fast math you can do.

Arnott: One of the other challenges that people face as they’re just starting out is how to prioritize building an emergency fund versus saving for retirement or paying down student loan debt. You outline a hierarchy for prioritizing those three objectives. Can you talk about that a little more?

Lester: I’ve seen people who use a similar hierarchy, I’ve seen different ones. And for me, it really boils down to—and maybe this is again coming out of my career—risk management and really avoiding the really, really bad outcomes. So, really, really bad outcomes are outcomes that push you into financial crisis or bankruptcy. So, to me the number-one priority is to really focus on building up your emergency fund because that is what’s going to keep you financially healthy, when you don’t have to run up credit card debt, when you need to replace your tires or hit a pothole—whatever the thing is, coming up with that $1,000, $2,000—you lose your job. So, emergency fund even more important than retirement.

But what if you have an employer who offers a matching 401(k) program? You also really want the free money. So, to me, if you don’t have a 401(k) plan and you only have to do this by yourself, you should just focus on your emergency savings first and then start working on your retirement savings. If you do have a 401(k) or a 403(b), or some other kind of workplace savings program, and you get matching from your employer, then you need to start working on both simultaneously. After you have at least three months of emergency fund—and again, I talk about in the book how you should think about three to six months. And if you are in a volatile industry, if you’re self-employed, if you know you’re in an economic environment that may make you more prone to a layoff, you might want to lean more toward six months. If you are a government employee and very unlikely to get fired, maybe you can do the three months. And you’re getting all of the free money from your employer. You get the full match from your employer, maybe not maxing out, maybe not at the target savings amount you want to get to, but at least getting the full match, then I think it’s very appropriate to turn your attention to paying down high interest-rate debt. So that is debt with—it’s a little bit arbitrary, like more than you would get investing the money in your 401(k) plan. I picked 8%. We could argue about is that 7%, is that 10%, but it’s 8%. You want to pay that down as fast as you can. And you want to continue making payments on the low-interest rate debt, which might be federal student loans or other kinds of debt under that 8% level. But you really want to get rid of that high interest-rate debt stuff first.

Benz: We wanted to switch over to discuss investing. I was struck by your investment recommendations in the book. You’re pretty unequivocal about keeping things simple with target-date funds or perhaps a three-index fund portfolio. I’m curious, was it liberating to be able to provide such clear-cut advice to tell people to just buy a basket of Vanguard index funds, for example, since you’re no longer working for an asset manager?

Lester: No, I don’t think so. To me, again, it goes back to how is somebody going to spend their mental and emotional energy. The first thing I recommend is target-date funds, because guess what, I used to manage target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in target-date funds. I’m a huge believer in active management as well. It’s hard to pick active managers because, especially in US equities, most managers don’t outperform. So, it requires time and emotional energy and a process and a lot of skill. So, I just think that’s asking an enormous amount of individuals. And at the end of the book, I do go into some tips for investing and say, “Look, if you think you’ve got the time, the energy, and the skill, then go for it.” It’s fun. I did it for a long time. I think it’s fun. But most people don’t think this stuff is fun. Most people don’t have the process or the—discipline, starts putting it into judge-y territory—just the time and the energy to spend doing it in a process that they can repeat. And I think unless you’re going to do it that way, you’re really better off not doing it at all and making it as simple as possible because the payoff for the incremental amount of emotional and intellectual energy you need to spend on this is uncertain.

Arnott: Do you think there’s a tendency on Wall Street to make investing seem more complicated than it really is or needs to be? And what’s the motivation behind that?

Lester: I’ve thought this for years that one of the main challenges for the financial-services industry when we talk to our clients is that we think this stuff is fun and interesting. Because guess what? Most of America, like I said before, just wants the whole thing to go away. Just tell me I’m going to be OK and make it go away. I don’t like this. It’s uncertain. If you make me think about saving for retirement, it’s unpleasant because I’m denying myself stuff I want right now. It’s volatile. You can’t promise me it’s going to work. And oh, by the way, I’m going to die at the end of this. Why should I like this experience? There’s nothing good about it if you don’t happen to think this stuff is intellectually interesting.

So, I think a huge part of the challenge is the industry is populated with people who geek out on this stuff and sometimes struggle to understand why clients don’t share our enthusiasm. So, right out of the gate, we’re like, we’re a mismatch of the intellectual starting point and then the vocabulary that we’re using. I think some of it is regulation in that those of us who are still subject to securities licenses have to be extraordinarily precise about how we say things, which makes us sound squirrely, frankly, when we’re talking because you can’t just say stuff. You have to qualify it all the time. And then you have to use very precise language, which also is very unrelatable. And I may have told you this ages ago, Christine, back in my former life where it took us a huge amount of effort to get regulatory and compliance people to allow us to use clip art to show the risks on the target-date funds for J.P. Morgan. How about saying this is a risky investment and putting that red circle with a line through it. That is pretty clear. Well, it took us months to get them comfortable using stuff that was that obvious and every time you get some industry move toward simplifying some of this stuff, something happens, and it gets pulled back the other way. So, some of that is self-inflicted. And then, yes, I will finally say that I do think that maybe some people—I’ve seen it happen—enjoy being mysterious and knowledgeable and being seen as experts. And when you want to be seen as an expert, you tend to lean in hard to jargon and sophistication that doesn’t help somebody understand very well. But I don’t think that’s all of the story.

Benz: I want to ask about financial advice and whether in the focus groups you got any clues as to how younger age bands are thinking about financial advice. You mentioned that they have widespread skepticism about the industry and the system. But any feedback on financial advice and the willingness of younger people to hire financial advisors and pay for them?

Lester: It was a little depressing to be honest—depressing and not so depressing depending on the hat you’re wearing. So, I was actually quite encouraged to see that people were really willing to take financial advice from their parents. And I was like, really? Wow, that makes me feel better as a parent, like my kids are listening to me, I think to a greater extent than prior generations did. So, clearly, our maybe helicopter parenting is paying off in some regards. Our kids actually may listen to us a little more. But certainly, there was a very wide strand of being willing to listen to social media because I can trust my peers. And I don’t want to listen to financial-services institutions because they’re just trying to make money off me, which makes my head explode. Because it’s like, well, what do you think all those people on social media are doing? What’s their financial model? Help me to understand how you think—why are they doing this? Some people really are doing this from the bottom of the goodness of their hearts. But I think a lot of people are doing this to make money. And some of them are extremely transparent about it. So why do you trust them more than a regulated financial-services institution whose employees will go to jail if they do it wrong rather than somebody on YouTube? I don’t understand that.

This skepticism of the man and not being willing to understand how the social media ecosystem works with people being sensationalist to get clicks to sell advertising and get paid by brand management people. Or, and I think we saw this happen with the whole GameStop thing, maybe running a little pump-and-dump stuff, that’s just like, how do you think they’re making money? Why do you think they’re doing this? And that struck me as rather naive, to be honest. I was surprised at the naivety behind that. Isn’t everybody doing this somewhat motivated by money?

Arnott: So, we’ve talked a lot about the target audience for this book, younger investors in either generation Z or millennials.

Lester: If I could say younger noninvestors. The person I most hope picks this book up is somebody who doesn’t see themselves as that investor.

Arnott: That’s a great point. Thanks for clarifying that. But we’d also like to talk about parents who have young adult children or kids who are still growing up. What advice do you have for parents who are trying to help their children navigate their finances when they’re just starting out?

Lester: Aside from giving my book to their children? I mentioned this book earlier today and I thought, I need to see if it’s still in print. I don’t know. It’s a book called Money Doesn’t Grow on Trees. And I remember reading it when my kids were in preschool, maybe. And it gave such a sensible outline for—you want your kids to be able to be making good, rational financial decisions when they’re in high school. And you want to give them control over their money so that you can watch them spend money. And the author for this advocated actually having them spend clothing, all of it, besides housing, basically. And with two boys who really didn’t care what they looked like, I wasn’t willing to give them control over their clothing budget because I knew they just wouldn’t buy any. So, I have standards and they were not hitting them. But we really tried to do that.

One of the things that I really learned in my book that I knew was true from my own story, but I had been quite struck at how true it was for so many other people, just not having a place to learn about how money works. And I don’t mean investing, like becoming a stock investor. That’s great, too. And if you want to do that with your child, that’s a fabulous thing to do. But I mean really basic stuff. Like you have $10 a week in discretionary spending and depending on your own circumstances and where you live and beliefs, that might be for a middle school student that I don’t know, however old they are. But that’s your money. You decide how you spend it. Don’t ask me for anymore. Period. That is really going to teach them some lessons about money with training wheels on because you’ll be there to rescue them when something happens that takes them off the rails. And I think that that was the single most powerful thing I took away from my children.

My husband and I talked about that a lot and applied it to all kinds of things like internet usage and when do you have certain privileges? Like senior year in high school, all the boundaries have to be gone. So, you can really not discover this sophomore year, or worse yet, discover them in your first job. That’s a terrible time to figure out that you really need to do your homework. Don’t do that your first job. So that to me was the most powerful thing I could imagine. And some of that trickles through the book too. How do you put guardrails on yourself? I think if you’re a parent, how do you open conversations about money up? I think one thing that I was very conscious of in this book is how much easier it is to be vulnerable with someone if they’ve been vulnerable with you first. And that’s very much something I try to do in my book is to say, look, just because somebody’s got the expert label doesn’t mean they knew how to do everything once upon a time. And I think that can be very effective for parents.

Benz: In our remaining time, we’re hoping to mine your deep expertise in the retirement savings system. You were central to J.P. Morgan’s retirement efforts for a couple of decades. So, we wanted to talk about target-date funds, which you managed. And some of the work that you and your team did comparing target-date fund investors returns to those of retirement plan participants who were self-directed and picking their own fund from the menu. Can you talk about the findings there and what you see as the implications?

Lester: Actually, I don’t cite those directly in the book, but it certainly featured in, as you point out, my focus on simplicity. I think even professional investors get caught in the fear/greed cycle. And again, just going back to behavioral economics, there are so many triggers for assuming you’re right—having overconfidence in your views; thinking that when everything is going well, it will keep going well; feeling more confident about risking more money; investing more in higher-risk assets when everything is going well. And if you’re a professional investor, you’ve got a team of people who, A, are trained in understanding that this is the way their brains are working, and B, a whole bunch of models and rigor and peers who are working to factor that those biases into the way you actually implement decisions so that you are less likely to fall into those traps. I think when you look at that specific research we talked about—and it’s not just the work that J.P. Morgan published, but Dalbar publishes research like this every year, and Morningstar has done a lot of this research too, I should say—when you look at the way individuals trade in and out of things, whether they’re individual stocks or mutual funds in their own investment accounts or inside of 401(k) plans, they typically buy high and sell low over and over and over again, which is how you destroy wealth. Or they’re wrong risked. And by that, I mean they’re in their 60s or 70s—we saw a lot of this—and had 100% in equities, or they’re 20 and had 100% in cash. So those two things—buying high and selling low, because you buy more when it feels good and you sell when you’re worried—is the opposite of how you make money, and then just having just absolute wrong level of risk for the time horizon that you’ve got. And those two things I think are the biggest contributors to that gap you see in performance.

Arnott: You mentioned automatic enrollment and auto-escalation as both being two very positive things for younger employees just starting out. Do you think that there are other types of nudges that might help people from a behavioral standpoint?

Lester: It’s just starting now, and I don’t know if this goes into your nudge category, but certainly, the potential now to add two things, which are both coming out of the Secure legislation: to add emergency savings funds and have those be payroll-deducted is huge. And again, there has been a lot of research done on the—Brigitte Madrian and many, many others over the years—if you don’t have emergency savings, people go into their 401(k) plans and borrow more than they otherwise would, just because you want to take it as much as you can. Once you start borrowing, you tend to borrow more than you need. And if you have an emergency savings fund, you don’t tap into that. So, I think that that’s a nudge if you get automatically signed up for that emergency savings. That’s, again, so powerful because so many people don’t have emergency savings. In fact, this one young woman who was so worried about her retirement fund didn’t have any. She was contributing fabulously to her 401(k). She had no emergency savings. And I’m like, “Well, you’re doing fine for retirement, but get the match, dial that down, get your emergency savings set up because you don’t want to pull it out of your 401(k).”

And then the second one is the contributions when workers are putting stuff into student loan payoffs. I think, again, for so many people, student loans are so challenging. And the more help you can give people to feel good about paying off the student loans, the better. And I know a little bit less about this personally but seeing more financial wellness-type programs being integrated into the 401(k) system is another way to help people. I don’t know that the uptake on those is as high as it could be, and that’s going to be an interesting thing to watch as it evolves.

Benz: I wanted to ask about the retirement saving system broadly speaking. We know that younger age bands are more likely to job hop than older workers. They cycle through jobs seemingly every couple of years. So, given that young workers are changing jobs frequently, does tethering our retirement savings to our employers even make sense? Or should policymakers be contemplating something like thrift savings program for the masses that would be entirely detethered from employers?

Lester: I’m personally a huge fan of the Australian system where the employer is obligated to pick a default provider. The provider in the Australian system, the super system, is not a government provider. They’re private. They are managed by fiduciaries, not the employer. So, it’s a private provider. But the only obligation for the plan sponsor is to create a default if the individual does not choose a provider for themselves. Australia also has mandatory contributions. I also think that’s good if you want to have retirement savings for people. That’s a whole other conversation. But the individual can also choose their own provider. And if you don’t put in your provider when you get hired by a new employer, they put you in the default. But you can very easily roll these together. You can keep track of it on a single system. There’s a single dashboard in Australia that you can see everything on. And to me, that is the best of all worlds—where you’ve got a default, you’ve got a failsafe, but you also have the ability for the individual, if they choose to, to say, this is what I want. And then they can have that follow them around for their whole career. So, I think that’s incredibly powerful.

I know why it started that it was an employee benefit. That was the way our system evolved. I think in hindsight, nobody would create that system on purpose. And I think a system where you’ve got the ability to contribute to a single pool, that that pool is accessible from any employer or platform. Coming out of the industry, I do believe that a competitive, well-regulated, with appropriate oversight, private market is going to come up with innovations and probably have a more robust experience than a pure public-type system would like the federal thrift savings program. But I think there’s a lot to learn from how that works, assuming you can have the portability or the ability to tap into that wherever you want it.

Arnott: We just have a few minutes left here. We’d like to zoom out and talk a little bit about your own experience, both during retirement so far and during your career. You had a very high-profile position at J.P. Morgan and were well-regarded for your work there. We often hear that people can really feel a loss of identity when they step away from a career like that. Can you talk about whether you felt that? And if so, how did you cope with those feelings?

Lester: I didn’t feel that. Part of it is that we announced that I was leaving in March of 2020. And the world just kind of stopped revolving the following week. So, I suspect I would have felt that a little more acutely because that offboarding process would have been nine months long or whatever it was. It would have involved what would have felt like a perpetual goodbye party—I was going to go speak at conferences and visit clients and do a world tour, and all of that would have been gratifying and made me really conscious of what I was leaving. I didn’t leave anything except a really chaotic and unpleasant-sounding work situation, frankly. It just sounded really hard to navigate. And I just remember telling Dan Oldroyd, who was the person who took over and was my deputy, I just remember telling him I am so grateful I’m not in charge of any of this, sorry! I don’t have to worry about… because once you announce you’re leaving a job like I have—I was still there, and I was still engaged, and I was still part of the team, but I wasn’t actually making any decisions anymore. So, that was a wonderful, wonderful thing for me personally. I think the team did a fabulous job navigating it, but it must have been so stressful.

And then, as the pandemic was ending, I had a couple of things I knew I wanted to do when I was leaving and was very public about. One was work on this book, which took me a little longer than I thought, but here we are. And the second was to do this pilgrimage walk. I had read a book before I actually had decided to leave J.P. Morgan about the Via Francigena, which is a pilgrimage trail from Canterbury, England, to Rome. It’s a 1,000 miles. And I just remember feeling this overwhelming “I have to do this” when I read the book. And it’s the first and maybe only time in my life—I’m not particularly at all religious—but this just was such a compulsion. I have never felt that strong a compulsion to go do something. And I had planned on doing that shortly after I left, and as you know, the world did not permit me to do that because of Covid. But it turned into a real touchstone for me that I was going to do this walk and between the book and the walk, I felt like I knew what I was doing. And then the world, like I said, was just completely shut down, so I didn’t really notice that, it was like what was there to miss? Nothing. So, that also frankly helped, I think.

Benz: I wanted to ask about your career and the fact that you managed to be a very successful woman in a field that is largely male dominated. So, what are your key tips for women who are building their careers, I would say, inside or outside the financial-services industry?

Lester: I guess I’d say a couple of things, and I don’t know if it’s because I grew up with brothers or what. And I have to say I think J.P. Morgan has consistently done an extraordinary job of having very senior women. And even when I got to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, there were already very senior women there in the ‘90s. I was often the only woman in the room but very quickly that actually stopped being true. And I can remember even in the early 2000s being on all-female deal teams and walking into finals pitches and having a bunch of guys coming out and then a bunch of women going in and we were just like, “Yeah, bet we’re going to win this one.” And we did, because often HR benefits people are women, so it was quite noticeable actually.

I don’t think I ever experienced personally that in-your-face discrimination. I think I certainly did notice in meetings what you hear a lot about, and I think happens all the time, which is that you say something and then a guy says that three or four minutes later and then everybody goes, “Oh, what a great point you made, sir.” And I was like, “What, I just said that.” And I certainly have actually made deals in meetings with other women to make sure we call each other out and make sure, “Yeah, it was a great point. Anne just made it 10 minutes ago,” or whoever just made that 10 minutes ago. And that helps. I think that’s a great thing to do—find some allies and make sure that you don’t get talked over. I think the younger generation, again, is so much better at that stuff than we are.

I think another thing that I would always say to women, and I would say it to men too, but I think women especially struggle with that if they’re thinking about having children is to know what your priorities are in terms of career progression, the importance of being compensated, keeping your skills fresh. I don’t know that anybody talks about work-life balance anymore, but if you got offered the chance to do a big deal or you had a big commitment with your child, which one would you pick? There’s no right answer here. Everybody has got their own priorities for all kinds of reasons. But if you don’t know what they are, when you get confronted with a choice— and I remember this happening to me in, I guess it was 2000 when I came back from maternity leave after my second child was born—I got put on this Internet Lab Morgan project, which was a huge big deal and we were in a fun room with beanbag chairs and free food and we were going to break everything and reinvent financial services with this crazy internet stuff. This was almost 25 years ago now. So, I just found myself staying later and later at work because there was all this cool stuff, and we were all innovating, and it was really intellectually exciting. And then I just remember thinking, “Wait, I’m getting home at 7:30 pm, like, what the heck, I’ve got a 9-month-old at home. No, no, no, no, no!” And I pulled way back and accomplished a little less in that role than I might have, and it may have affected my career and I’m fine with that, because I had a priority and that was making sure I was home in time to have dinner with my baby or certainly feed him and have bath time with him and read him a story before he went to bed. I was sliding in 10-minutes-before-bedtime kind of a thing, and I just was like this is not the person I want to be. And it made that choice. I didn’t mind making the choice because I knew I was out of alignment with my values.

Benz: Well, Anne, this has been such a fun and wide-ranging conversation. Thank you so much for taking time to share your insights today. We really appreciate it.

Lester: Thank you, and it was great fun on my side, too. Thank you.

Transcript

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Ann Garcia. Ann is a certified financial planner. She’s also the author of the book How to Pay for College. She’s the managing partner of Independent Progressive Advisors, a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor in Portland, Oregon. And she’s also the author of The College Financial Lady blog. She received her BA from the University of California, Berkeley.

Ann, welcome to The Long View.

Ann Garcia: Thank you for having me.

Benz: Thanks for being here. We want to talk about your book, How to Pay for College. In the book, you relate an experience from your advice practice. You were working with an attorney. She wanted to change to a less stressful career path, but she couldn’t because she owed massive amounts of student debt. Can you discuss how that was one of the events that sparked your interest in wanting to focus on helping people make smarter decisions about paying for college and other types of higher education?

Garcia: I would say, she was an extreme example of people that I was talking with. But at the time that I had the conversation with her, and this was a woman who had gone to law school, she had taken out student loans for her undergraduate years, taken out student loans for her grad school years, she had federal loans, she had private loans, and she had even borrowed money from her family. And was really not happy as an attorney and wanted to make a career change, but she was absolutely stuck because of all of those loans. And like I said, she was an extreme example of someone I worked with. And ultimately, our plan was around planning for future insolvency for her, which is when she got to the end of her student loan debt and would have those loans forgiven, that she wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it because she would be insolvent in the IRS’ definition where your debts far exceed your assets and your ability to pay them.

And again, while she was an extreme example, I was talking to lots and lots of young adults who were coming in and interested in making plans but had so little free cash flow after their student loan payments that they were struggling to start a retirement account or even have emergency savings, to say nothing of buying homes or doing all the things that we think of as the standard building blocks of adulthood. And at the same time, there was another group of people that I felt like I was hearing from a lot, and those were parents who were struggling to figure out how they were going to pay for their children’s educations and putting it as a very high priority overall in their goals but not really having an understanding of how they were going to come up with the dollars to do it.

So, I realized that if I could help that group of parents that maybe I could reduce the number of those other young adults that I was talking to. But I would say the attorney really made it very tangible. I knew there were people out there who owed all these student loans. But sitting across the table from this woman and seeing the sense of hopelessness that she felt as a result of getting a great education was very life changing to me, because to me, education has always been a building block of opportunity, of adulthood, and to see that it was completely the opposite for her made a huge impression on me.

Ptak: In the book, you wrote that when it comes to college, no outside entity will protect you from making a terrible financial decision, and then you go on to note that you couldn’t get a mortgage for a house you could never afford, but nothing stops people from borrowing more for college than you can pay back. Why are there fewer guardrails around college outlays, do you think?

Garcia: It’s a great question. On the one hand, the federal student loan programs for students do have some pretty strict guardrails, but nothing prevents students from going and getting additional loans on the private market or parents from taking out parent PLUS Loans. And we as people tend to think that what our children want and need, and particularly the best possible version of that, is worthy of every penny that we have. And, unfortunately, no one will stop you from taking out these loans.

The way that the direct student loan, which is the loan that undergraduate students can take, is structured is, it’s the one loan that an 18-year-old can take without a co-signer, without any kind of credit history and still get a very favorable interest rate. And so, that opens up all these other issues that don’t exist in normal loans. There is no qualification for that loan other than filing the FAFSA. I firmly believe that if there were less loans available to parents, the cost of college would be much lower than it is, because I think that making all those additional dollars available and having an audience that’s willing to spend that kind of money has a huge impact on driving up the cost of college.

Benz: We want to spend some time on deciding whether loans are appropriate and also the FAFSA that you referenced, the application for financial aid. But before we get into the weeds a little bit in college funding, I want to hear about your own experience with this. You wove that in a little bit into your book. You went through the application and college-funding process not too long ago with your twins. So, I’m curious, what were some of the biggest surprises for you, a college-funding expert, as you went through that process with your two children?

Garcia: A great question. There were definitely plenty of them. As much as we can learn—we always learn there’s plenty more out there that we don’t know. So, I have twins who are currently college seniors, and they’re very, very different students. So, their two college application processes were very different. I think to me, one of the biggest surprises, given that I’m a really analytical person and I took a really analytical approach to college and encouraged my kids to see it the same way, I was surprised at how different the responses that they got from different colleges were.

So, for example, my son applied to two colleges. He applied early action to both, which is where you submit your application early, you get an answer early, but you have until the regular decision deadline to make a decision. One of the colleges replied instantly to him with an acceptance and a big scholarship offer and sent him stickers—put one on your laptop, put one on your phone. He was getting emails multiple times a week. Something would come in the mail periodically. And it was just crickets from the other school. And I thought we were going to receive two acceptances and two award letters on roughly the same schedule and be able to sit down and deliberate our way through them. But instead, he was getting this marketing onslaught from one of the colleges and hearing nothing from the other. And for a 17-year-old it was like, oh, somebody likes me and somebody else doesn’t. And it was a very challenging, emotional side of the college application process to deal with.

I think one of the really important lessons for me in going through this with my own kids is that planning for college is equal parts financial planning and parenting. Making sure that your kids understand the process, understand the budget, understand the priorities and what they’re trying to do and that you’re putting some guardrails around their decisions and around their exploration so that you can help them and coach them to good decisions in that process.

I think another big surprise for us was the number of colleges that use unweighted GPA to award merit scholarship. As you go through high school, the schools really encourage students to take higher-level courses, AP/IB, dual credit, whatever it is that the high school offers. That tends to be presented as the best choice in every circumstance. We learned from my son’s experience, where he took a lot of those classes and really struggled in them, they weren’t a good fit for him as a student. So, we were disappointed to see that the college that he chose awarded scholarships on the basis of unweighted GPA. And if we had not pushed him into all these higher-level courses, he would have been eligible for about $12,000 a year more in merit scholarships. I’m not going to say you shouldn’t challenge yourself academically or you shouldn’t take the hardest courses that are available to you. He certainly felt well-prepared as a student when he got to college. But having an extra $48,000 left over because of bigger scholarships would have been a real difference-maker for our family.

Ptak: I think you mentioned your twins are, in addition to being different people, they’re different types of students. How did you approach the college process differently with each of them?

Garcia: I was fortunate that they both wanted different things from the college process. My daughter, we felt, was a really good fit for a private college, a smaller environment, and she was very committed to not going to college around home. And so, we went out and did the whole college tour where we went and visited a whole bunch of colleges. We talked a lot about budgets and funding, because obviously, those were for the most part quite a bit more expensive than our in-state schools. But very much encouraged her to explore those options. One of the things that you find is that just the costs are so different across the board in colleges, and if you’re willing to use cost as one of the lenses that you’re looking at for college, you can find a lot of different opportunities. So, with her, we really explored a range of opportunities and saw that college was available to her at a range of different prices. And we were fortunate that her top choice school accepted her with a great financial aid package, but that involved writing a lot of essays, doing a lot of applications, applying for a lot of different scholarships so that she could close the gap between our budget and some of the colleges that she was interested in.

Our son, on the other hand, was I would say, a very typical boy. He thought school was OK. But he liked sports. He liked having a job. He liked having a girlfriend. So, high school was one of several priorities. And for him we sort of jokingly said, we’ll put as much effort into paying for college as you put into being successful in high school. So, his budget for college was what it would cost him to stay in state. We said, you can probably find some other alternatives besides this, but this is really what the budget is. And he was fortunate to find another option that had a scholarship just for someone like him.

But with my daughter, we used an essay coach to help her with her applications because there were just too many essays that she had to write. We joked it was our winter break vacation insurance just to have somebody else make sure that all got done. We had her do some test prep classes because she was applying to highly selective colleges. She took a full suite of IB classes in high school. With our son, it was the complete opposite. There was an after-school ACT prep class that was free at our high school that he signed up for. He applied to two colleges. He got into both and was perfectly happy with where that ended up.

I will say too now that they’re seniors and they’ve both gone very, very different paths in college, they have each accepted a job for when they graduate, which are virtually identical jobs but for the particular fields of study that they’re in. So, two important points there. One is, everyone can find a path that works for them. And two is, going to a highly selective school versus a highly not selective school does not have a huge impact on what the actual outcomes that the student should expect are.

Benz: I wanted to ask about that, Ann, because the data are fairly clear that going to college delivers a payoff in terms of lifetime earnings and so forth as well as something you talked about in the book: health and maybe even happiness. But where you go, what do the data say about that in terms of outcomes, life outcomes, earnings? The highly selective schools versus less-selective schools, what do we know when we look at the data on that?

Garcia: The data is pretty clear on that where you go to school really is not what’s going to determine who you are as an adult. You can look at big surveys. You can also look at things like where the Fortune 500 CEOs went to college. And the college that produced the most Fortune 500 CEOs is not Harvard, it’s not Stanford; it’s Texas A&M. Every year Rhodes scholarships are announced right before Thanksgiving, and the students who are selected represent an incredible diversity of undergraduate institutions and clearly not just the Ivy Leagues.

There was a great research project that was done a few years ago called the Purdue-Gallup report. In this survey, they surveyed adults who self-rated as successful. So, it’s not we’re only talking to people whose incomes are above X, but we’re talking to people who are themselves successful and satisfied with their lives. And it was all about figuring out how college had informed that success. What they found was there was no correlation whatsoever between what college they went to, what type of college they went to, or any of those “which college” questions about it. Really their success came down to specific experiences that they had in college. So, they were things like feeling like their professors cared about them, being able to apply what they learned in the classroom to the world at large, participating in extracurriculars, finding mentors who could help them explore life paths and whatnot. And I would say, my experience as a parent has been that both of my kids found environments where they engaged and really made the most of their four-year college experience, which is what has led them both to great career paths coming out of two really different colleges.

I encourage parents to think about why college as opposed to which college. So, there are lots and lots of good reasons for students to go to college—higher lifetime earnings. Your typical college graduate will make about $1 million total over their lifetime more than those without a college degree. Unemployment rates are much lower. But there are tons of noneconomic benefits to going to college as well. There’s lower heart disease and type 2 diabetes among college graduates than nongraduates. College graduates marry at higher rates and divorce at lower rates than noncollege graduates. So, there are all sorts of halo effects of getting a college education, none of which is dependent on which specific college you went to.

Ptak: But it will cost you, and that’s something that you talk about in your book, in which you note that the cost of attendance at public universities and private colleges increased by nearly 500% between 1986 and 2016. What are the key factors that has led the college inflation rate to be so much higher than the general inflation rate for the past several decades?

Garcia: It’s hard to point to one specific thing. It’s really a cluster of factors. You could talk about declining state funding, you could talk about increasing administrative costs and not just highly paid college presidents, but also the whole suite of support services that have been deployed across colleges to make sure that kids graduate in four years and move on to productive places in the world—nicer dorms, nicer facilities, upgraded labs, all kinds of things. I personally think that a big reason why the cost of college has gone up so much is that so many people are willing to pay the full price of college. As much as I talk to people about finding scholarships, finding ways to reduce their cost of college, budgeting for college and being realistic about what college costs, the number of people who go into the college application process expecting to pay full price for their child to attend a private school is absolutely mind boggling. And I firmly believe that if we all just decided we weren’t going to pay $80,000 a year for college, college wouldn’t cost $80,000 a year.

Benz: Well, I’m curious, Ann, who’s paying the full freight?

Garcia: Lots of families. Looking at the most selective colleges, anywhere between a quarter and a third of families are not even filing the FAFSA at all. So, they’re going into that expecting that they will pay full price. In my practice, I regularly talk to parents who say, “I know this college costs $75,000 a year, but it’s just perfect for my child and I really want to make that happen.” And it’s shocking to me. There is a large body of people out there who do believe that paying full price for college is perfectly OK.

Fortunately, it’s not the majority of people, and as a result, to fill the rest of those seats at the college, colleges are forced to discount tuition pretty substantially. One of the things that I pay attention to is what’s called the tuition discount rate, and that’s the average rate at which colleges discount their tuition. That rate is actually higher than 50% right now, which means that for every $1,000 of tuition that’s charged, less than $500 is paid. That does not mean that you will pay half of what list price is, but that does mean that if you are willing to look for colleges that offer scholarships for students like your child, you will find them. And in fact, the average net price of college has been pretty flat since the Great Recession, which means that, although published list prices are going up by about 6% a year, the actual amount that people are paying has stayed pretty flat.

Ptak: What role do you think a student’s anticipated career path, to the extent they have one, should play in determining how much to spend on college and whether to take loans to cover it?

Garcia: That’s such a good question because I know there’s that adage of don’t borrow more than your anticipated first-year salary. I would say to that 50% of students go into college undeclared and about 75% change their major over the course of their college career. So, it’s a little bit risky to say, “I’m going in as an engineer and engineers make $75,000 a year average starting salary. So, I’m fine to borrow that much and therefore, I’m going to choose XYZ college as a result.” You may end up being an engineer, but you also might not. And so, making a financial commitment on that basis is, I think, really unwise.

Again, this is me speaking as a parent. I feel like kids are under a lot of pressure when they’re in high school to know what they want to be and to know what their major is going to be and to treat college as a four-year pathway to a career versus an opportunity to really explore broadly. So, to the extent that we are coaching our kids that that’s what they should be thinking as a 16, 17-year-old when they have very little experience or visibility to the world of careers and in particular, a lot of those higher-paying initially fields like engineering, where they, again, don’t have a whole lot of direct experience with what that job looks like, what those courses look like, I think that’s really quite risky.

My recommendation to parents is always that they stick within the limits of the federal direct student loan program for their borrowing. Students who take out that loan every year will graduate from college owing somewhere upward of $27,000, depending on interest rates and how much interest has accrued, and that translates to a monthly payment of around $325 a month for 10 years. That’s an amount that a college degree will almost always cover. In fact, very few students who earn a bachelor’s degree and take out federal direct student loans, very few of them are among those groups of people who really struggle with student loans.

Benz: You talk about that in the book, Ann, who is struggling with student loans. Can you characterize those individuals? What sorts of decisions they’ve made? What sorts of career paths they’ve chosen, and so forth?

Garcia: Absolutely. I feel like, if you listen to the news, you think taking out a student loan is a one-way ticket to the poor house. And for a lot of students, student loans are the difference between going to college and not going to college. So, there’s definitely a universe where that’s an OK decision, and to me, that’s those students who take out that direct student loan and graduate with a reasonable amount.

The people who are really struggling with student loans fall into three categories. One is people who go to graduate school. With graduate school, you can borrow up to the full cost of attendance. Many students go into graduate school still owing on their undergraduate loans, and they end up like my attorney/client from years ago where the interest keeps accruing on those loans while they’re in college, and they graduate owing well into the six figures. We tend to think of doctors and attorneys when we think of those people with tons and tons of student loan debt and say, well, they’re going to have careers that will allow them to pay it off. But there are an increasing number of career paths that require advanced degrees. Social work, physical therapy in many states requires a doctorate, veterinarians. All kinds of career paths that don’t have anywhere near the salary expectations of doctors and lawyers and there are loads and loads of people who are in well over their head on student loan debt from graduate school.

Another group is people who go to college, take out loans, and then don’t graduate. So, those are people who have that student loan debt but don’t have the earnings power that goes hand in hand with having earned the degree. The third group is people who attend for-profit colleges, and those are the colleges that you hear about in the news for their predatory lending practices, they might be schools for massage therapy, or cooking schools, or places where you go to get a technical degree, where in many cases, the degree that a student earns from those colleges is not worth the paper that it’s printed on. Nonetheless, they’re allowed to take out student loans to go there, and they come out fortunate to be able to find minimum-wage-level work, but with oftentimes graduate-school-level student loan debt.

Ptak: What’s your take on whether parents should take on debt to help pay for their kids’ college? Do you think that’s ever a good idea?

Garcia: There are very limited circumstances, I would say, where that makes sense. I generally try to discourage it because most parents are in their 50s when their student comes out of college. And if you come out of college in your 50s with student loan debt and maybe still having a mortgage and trying to make your retirement catch-up contributions, something is going to fall by the wayside. I just feel like the timeline for parents to pay off student loans is really not favorable.

There are a few instances where that could make sense. For example, a parent who’s much older. I had a client whose dad was 71 when the daughter went off to college. The family didn’t have a lot of money. But because of quirks in the FAFSA formula, they weren’t eligible for the financial aid that they should have been eligible for. And in their case, what they ended up doing was having dad take out Parent Plus loans for college, get into an income-based repayment program, defer the loans as long as possible. And he’ll make a payment of about $60 a month for the rest of his life and then those loans will retire with him.

Another group of parents who might consider taking out loans are parents who are eligible for public service loan forgiveness. So, for example, a parent who’s a teacher or who works for a nonprofit, Parent Plus loans can actually be consolidated into direct consolidation loans, and then the parent can get into the income-driven repayment program and then make payments for 10 years and have the loan balance forgiven. It can be a bit of a risky strategy because the parent needs to be sure that they have at least a 10-year career path following their child’s graduation, so after they are able to consolidate those loans and go into repayment and get that forgiveness. Because otherwise, they’ll make income-driven payments and then be stuck without the forgiveness and with the larger balance that goes along with that.

Sometimes for parents who are quite young, it can make sense just because they haven’t had the earnings power maybe over the course of their child’s lifetime to save in high amounts. Sometimes families will talk about strategies that they might use, like a lower-income family, where the grandparents have a bunch of money and would be willing to help the student with college but taking that help might impact their financial aid. Sometimes those families will have the parents take out loans and the grandparents repay them once they’re graduated. But by and large, the direct student loan for students is really the best place to go for borrowing. And I tell parents too that even if the parent intends to be the one paying for college and being the one paying for the loan, it should still be the student who takes out the loan. There’s a couple reasons for that. One is that the direct student loan has the lowest fees and the lowest interest rates of all the federal loans. Another is that the student is more likely to be at an income level where their student loan interest could be deductible, and that could be roughly equivalent to one month’s payment every year, and it can help the student to build credit as well.

Benz: I want to stick with parental finances for a second longer. A perennial issue in households where parents have children is how to balance their own retirement savings alongside saving for college. I know there’s always that visceral pull on the part of so many parents to send their kids wherever their hearts desire. But what are practical strategies for parents balancing those two expensive financial goals?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a delicate balancing act too, because as you’ve seen, for a lot of parents, college is such a tangible thing and retirement is this very nebulous far off, I don’t know what that looks like, I don’t know what I want to do.

Benz: Right.

Garcia: But I do know that I want my kid to go to college in 2031. So, a couple of things. One is, I think, that we as advisors need to step away from the two most common pieces of advice that we give—one is, don’t save for college; save for retirement. You can take out loans for college, not for retirement. That’s how we ended up with a trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt. But the other thing that advisors tend to tell families is, “You want your child to go to private school, well, private school costs $80,000 a year. Inflation rate of this, times four years. That means you need to save $2,000 month every month if you want your child to be able to go to private college.” That doesn’t work for families either. So, there needs to be some sort of middle ground.

My recommendation is this: If you don’t have emergency savings, you don’t have college savings. Emergency savings should always be a family’s first priority. Families who are saving for retirement but not maxing out retirement shouldn’t contribute more than 10% of what they’re putting toward retirement into college. So, if you’re saving $10,000 a year for retirement, you should not save more than $1,000 a year for college. If you want to save more for college, then save more for retirement in addition and move those two up together. Once parents are maxing out on retirement savings, then they have more flexibility to add to their college savings. The things that families can do if they’re really not able to contribute as much as they’d like to to savings—most 529 plans have a gifting page that you can share with family and encourage them to be making contributions to that account. I also encourage families to every year on their child’s birthday look at their budget, think about who their child is becoming and who they want them to become in the future and use that as an opportunity to bump up their savings rate, even if it’s by $5 a month. The more savings you have, the more choices your child will have. There are loads and loads of pathways through college at whatever amount of savings a family has. So, certainly, if you’re not saving $2,000 a month, you have not eliminated the option of going to private school. And I say that as a parent who never contributed more than a couple of hundred dollars a month to my kids’ 529s and whose daughter is going to graduate from the world’s most expensive private college debt-free in June.

Ptak: Speaking of 529s, I think you think the 529 college savings plan is the best option for saving for college. But there’s a lot of confusion about the interplay, how savings affects financial aid eligibility. What do people need to know about that?

Garcia: And that is, I think, such a big fear for parents that if I save, I’m going to lose out on financial aid. Savings have a very negligible impact on financial aid eligibility. So, there are four components to the FAFSA’s formula for calculating expected family contribution or student aid index. It counts the parents’ income, the parents’ assets, the student’s income, and the student’s assets. The parents’ income is by far the biggest piece of that, simply because of how the formula counts the parents’ income. Any nonretirement savings that the family has, and that includes money in your checking or savings account, it includes taxable brokerage accounts, it includes 529 accounts for all the family’s children. Those are assessed at 5.64% of their value, which means that every $1,000 you have in savings costs you $56 in the financial aid formula. That puts you ahead by $944. So, yes, it will cost you a small amount in financial aid, but it will open up a world of additional choices to your child to have some savings.

Benz: I’m curious, Ann, are there any ways to think about your own household financial picture as you’re embarking on this FAFSA, which you think is really important for everyone to fill out? Any hacks that you can share to make yourself look better on FAFSA?

Garcia: So, I would say, filing the FAFSA is a lot like filing your taxes. If you wait till April 15 and just fill out the form, you’ll probably end up owing a little bit more than you would have if you had thought about it may be back in October and made some plans. The FAFSA works the same way. So, as I was saying, the biggest piece of the formula is the parents’ income. The biggest place where people put attention is the parents’ assets and that’s mostly because the assets are the only thing you can do anything about when the time comes to file it. The FAFSA uses what’s called prior year income, which means when you file the FAFSA in the fall, you’re using your most recently completed tax return, and it’s for the education year of the next year. So, it’s 2023. If I’m filing the FAFSA in the fall of 2023 to start college in the fall of 2024, I’m using my 2022 income tax return. So, that is the year that starts Jan. 1 of sophomore year and goes through Dec. 31 of junior year.

There are really limited things you can do to hack the FAFSA, game the FAFSA because of how the formula is structured. I think if you went to your manager and said please don’t pay me my December paycheck in January, please can I have that in December? Can I have that in January instead? They would say no, sorry, that’s not that’s not going to work. The biggest subtraction from your income that you have is how much you pay in taxes. So, families who are eligible for need-based aid might choose to pay more taxes in a year that counts for the FAFSA and that could mean switching your retirement contributions from pretax to Roth. That could mean pushing tax deductions into other years if you itemize. That’s really the biggest way to influence the FAFSA.

If you’re someone who has an inherited IRA where you’re taking lifetime distributions, you might increase those distributions in the years before your FAFSA income years in order to reduce the amount of distribution that you have to take in those FAFSA years. People tend to think that, oh, if I put more money into retirement, that will help me. The FAFSA doesn’t use adjusted gross income. It uses total income. So, it has you add back all of your pretax income sources. A lot of families are given the guidance that they should use a Roth IRA instead of a 529 to pay for college because they don’t report that Roth IRA as an asset on the FAFSA. The problem is that when you take the money out, you do report it as income. And every incremental dollar of income is assessed at $0.47 of its value, whereas every incremental dollar of assets is assessed at 5.6% of its value. So, not really a ton of hacks for families who have W-2 income other than putting more tax dollars into their FAFSA income years.

One thing that families tend to overlook is that student’s assets are also part of the formula. And with wages having risen as much as they have in the last few years, students often earn a lot of money over the summer—if they’re making $15 an hour working 30 hours a week for 10 weeks, that’s a pretty good amount of money that might be in their bank account still when the time comes for them to file the FAFSA. I always encourage families if the student has money that is money that’s intended for college, they can put it in the parents’ 529 and then it’s treated as a parent asset where it’s less heavily weighed in the formula.

A better strategy than trying to game the FAFSA is to first figure out if it’s even worth it. And the Department of Education has a tool on their website called the Student Aid Estimator. With a Student Aid Estimator, you can enter your family’s financial data and they’ll give you an estimate of what your expected family contribution or student aid index, which is what it will be called starting this year, what that is. If that number is higher than the cost of college, then you are not eligible for need-based financial aid and you don’t need to get into a whole bunch of games around how to file; what you’re going to do to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. Most families aren’t in that threshold. So, it certainly makes sense to do what you can to make yourself look better on the FAFSA. The other thing is, assets are a piece of it. Again, because they count for so little, you have to do some pretty big things to make them make a difference. A lot of people seem to think you have to file the FAFSA on Oct. 1. I usually encourage people to pay all their big bills before they file the FAFSA—any money that’s going to get out of your account anyway, you might as well do it before you file. So, if you can pay your property taxes before you file, if you can make an early mortgage payment. Definitely wait till after you’ve paid your mortgage and your credit card. But a lot of that really is nibbling around the edges.

Ptak: I know you said there aren’t a lot of hacks, but that was very, very educational. Thanks for that. I did want to ask you about scholarships. You note that merit scholarships are the primary means of tuition discounting. Are those based exclusively on the student’s test scores, academic performance, and other personal qualities, or do FAFSA and the family’s financial wherewithal come into play in that area too?

Garcia: It depends. There’s such a range of scholarships. To give you an example of the range of scholarships, my son has a scholarship for playing video games. Yeah, for video games, not for academics or anything else. There are some merit scholarships that have a need-based component to them. So, even families who don’t think that they’re going to be eligible for financial aid should be filing the FAFSA, because sometimes that’s a requirement to be considered for a scholarship that is a merit scholarship. By and large, the merit scholarships are based on grades, to some degree on test scores, that depends a lot on the college right now, or because the student has some other attribute that the college is interested in, such as being a good video game player.

Or alternatively, for example, a lot of the smaller private schools take a lot of pride in having students from every state. You might be the only student from your state who’s applying there, and they’re going to really want to make sure that you actually enroll and attend so they can keep saying that. Obviously, that works better for those of us from smaller states like Oregon than those of you from larger states like Illinois. But if you draw a 200-mile radius around your house and start looking for colleges that are outside that 200-mile radius, you might find that you are getting more scholarship offers than you think you are. But the majority of merit scholarships are done on the basis of grades, and the reason for that is that colleges want to attract higher-performing students because that makes them look better in the U.S. News & World Report Rankings. So, families who want to find where their student might be eligible for scholarships, there are great websites like CollegeData and College Navigator that will show you median 50 percentile GPAs and test scores for the current freshman class so that you can see if you’re above that range, you’re probably going to be eligible for a merit scholarship if that college offers merit scholarships.

Benz: You referenced those U.S. News & World Report Rankings. Can you discuss the interplay between these merit scholarships and schools’ rankings there?

Garcia: So, in case anybody still tracking, Rick Singer just got sentenced to prison. That was the guy who helped people fake their kids’ resumes and transcripts and test scores. So, the thing with the U.S. News & World Report Rankings is, colleges want to do better at them, and they want to move up in the rankings, and they use merit scholarships to attract students who will help them move up in the rankings. One of the rankings criteria is the caliber of the student body in that space, primarily now on grades, secondarily on test scores. There’s been an adjustment in the test score component of it where it used to be that colleges were downgraded if more than 10% of their students did not submit test scores. They’ve changed that. So, now, it’s if more than 50% of your students don’t submit test scores, they do get downgraded in the rankings. But U.S. News Rankings are a huge issue for colleges because so many families use them to say, oh, College X is better than College Y. And so, merit scholarships are the primary tool that colleges use to attract the students who will help them to move up in the rankings. And that’s why if your student has a GPA that’s in the upper quartile or the top quintile of the student bodies, they are probably someone that college would like to enroll.

Benz: I wanted to follow up on that, Ann, because this has come up with several of my friends’ kids where they have this conundrum about whether to reach for the higher-cost prestigious school versus going to the somewhat less-prestigious school that is much less costly because it’s awarding a lot more merit-based aid. So, how should students and their families approach that issue?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s such a tough area for parents to navigate. I would say that as a society we have a tendency to equate cost and exclusivity with quality. And yet, you look at college and it’s a very subjective experience. When I look at my own two kids who are twins, each of them is thriving in the environment that they’re in, and each of them is thriving in an environment that’s very different from where their twin is. And I don’t think that either one of them would be successful if they were to change places.

I think it’s really important for parents to focus on what environments—academically and socially and financially—what types of environments is there student likely to succeed in? One of the things that my daughter loved about her college when we went to visit it, is they said, every dorm is divided into houses, so you have a small group of around 100 students who are in your house, and every house has its own table in the dining commons where they sit to each. And she said, oh my gosh, not having lunch table drama would be so amazing. My son wanted the big college, football Saturdays’ experience. He craved the anonymity of a big school after toiling in the shadows of his far more academically successful sister for the previous 18 years. I think success is so subjective. Going back to that Purdue-Gallup study, where is your student going to engage, where are they going to find mentors, where are they going to find projects that fit for them? Those are the things that lead to success, not the name on your diploma. College makes you a more educated version of yourself. It’s not what creates yourself.

Ptak: We asked you about hacks before. We’re going to try again. Maybe you can share some hacks that high school students and their families should consider to improve their eligibility for merit scholarships.

Garcia: I think, the best thing for students to do is to look close to home. Have that be your starting point. Every college and career center has a big list of scholarships that are available to you. So, this is looking at the outside scholarships for merit scholarships. So, look at those, talk to teachers, talk to coaches, ask them what scholarships you should be looking at. On the institutional side, a really great starting point is looking at your in-state colleges and seeing what their merit awards are and what criteria they’re granted on. So, we always think of merit scholarships as being part of the private school landscape. They’re also a big part of the public school landscape. Look at what scholarships are offered and who gets them. Typically, at public schools, there are a range of scholarships that you will automatically get as long as your GPA is above a certain threshold. So, look at that. Look at that early in your high school career so that you are tracking toward that GPA, so that you are choosing your courses on that basis. It was a big learning to us that a lot of schools use unweighted GPA in awarding scholarships. And had we looked into that a little earlier, we would have gotten a lot more scholarship dollars.

The other thing to look at is many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, the good news is, simply submitting your college application and your FAFSA and CSS Profile if you’re applying to a school that needs them is going to put you in the running for a lot of the scholarships that the college offers. Many colleges have additional scholarships above and beyond that. So, for example, when my daughter was looking at colleges, she had a budget. We did the net price calculators for all the schools that she looked at to see what our likely cost would be. And one of the colleges she was interested in was above our cost. She went back to their website and found out there was another scholarship she could apply for that would bring her cost down to where it would fit in our budget. So, that one made our list.

Speaking of which, the best hack for families getting started is the net price calculator at the college. So, every college is required to have one of these. It’s a tool where you input your financial, and sometimes your academic, information, and it will tell you what students like you received financial aid on average in the current academic year. They’re not foolproof, and they’re not a guarantee of what you’re going to get. I will say that, in our case, every actual award that my daughter got was within $2,000 of what the net price calculator had told us it would be. So, those are a great indication of what a college is likely to cost you.

Above and beyond that, lots and lots of departments within the college have their own sets of scholarships that they offer. We have a friend whose son is studying meteorology and that being a small major, lots and lots of colleges had dollars available for meteorology students, and I was like, well, that’s nice for Myles, but what about for Alex and Gabby, my kids, who did not have such specific interests? And we found the business school has scholarships for students. A lot of private colleges offer scholarships to students who live within a small radius of where they attend, or students whose parents are police officers or firefighters. So, do your homework on the schools to find out what they offer, because oftentimes the most expensive schools on paper are not the most expensive schools in reality. My daughter goes to, as I said, the most expensive school on Earth, but it was her second-cheapest choice once she got her aid package, and that’s not at all atypical. So, do the net price calculators, look at the scholarship page on the school, and then look for outside scholarships. And for those, look close to home. Ask teachers, ask your employer about any scholarships that they have. My daughter’s computer science teacher in high school had recommended that she apply for a scholarship, which she ended up getting and it’s been $5,000 a year, plus she got a computer one year and then every year since then she’s gotten $1,000 to spend on technology. She also got a professional mentor who helped her land an internship that has led to a full-time job offer when she graduates, and that all came from a high school teacher.

Benz: Sounds like a good scholarship. I wanted to ask about applying because you go into some detail about figuring out where to apply. It’s stunning how many schools kids seem to be applying to. But how many schools should students apply to? And also, what sort of diversity should students and their families look for in terms of the types of college that they apply to? You have some guidance in the book on that.

Garcia: It’s so easy with the Common App to just add more colleges to your list. Because in many cases, it’s just checking a box and sending your application. It costs about $100 for every school that you apply to, particularly if they are private schools, because you’re sending the CSS Profile and probably some test scores in addition to paying an application fee. So, first and foremost, you should give your student an application budget and make sure that all the colleges fit within that budget. In my book, I have a worksheet for students to track the colleges that they’re interested in and thinking of applying to.

One of the things with private colleges is they typically require three essays each. One of them is the Common App standard essay. But then, they will typically have two additional essays that you will have to write a specific essay for that school. So, as you add colleges to your list, not only are you adding cost and check boxes on the Common App, but you’re also adding work for your student, work in writing essays, work in figuring out what letters of rec you need because some colleges also require the letters of rec to be from specific types of teachers versus the general population. There may be scholarships that the student is applying for that have additional applications. And much as you want your child to have this unlimited universe of choices, you also want them to be present for their senior year of high school. And if all they’re doing is writing college application essays, they will not be present in other aspects of their life.

So, my recommendation for families is always, number one, find a financial safety school that belongs on your list. That’s probably some flavor of in-state public school. It may be alternate pathways like free community college. So, once you’ve identified at least one safety school, you want to make sure that you have a good body of schools that your student is going to be accepted to. And then, include some reach schools if you want. With my family, we used a couple of tools to narrow down our list. One was the net price calculators. So, every college that my daughter was interested in, we did the net price calculator. If it came out to above a certain number, that college was automatically off of our list unless she could find a pathway through other scholarships that weren’t included there that would get you there. And then, we did the exercise of why would you go there. And so, we went through every college she was looking at and said, why would you go there? So, if you got accepted to all of these colleges, to every college you applied to, which one would you choose? And she had two colleges that she said she’d have a hard time choosing between. And then, we went through this exercise of, OK, if you didn’t get into those two, what would be the next one that you’d want to go to? Which one from this group that we’re pretty sure that you’re going to get into would you choose? So, we went through that exercise and got her down to a list of about eight schools that she applied to. Even applying to eight colleges, she still had to write 24 essays, and not all of them were specific for the schools; some were for scholarships, some were for other things. So, you definitely want to manage your student’s workload. If you can’t figure out a reason why you would actually attend that college, then just don’t apply. But do make sure that you have financial safety schools as well as admission safety schools on your list.

I would think students shouldn’t apply to more than 10 schools. I think I said my son applied to two and he was fine with that and had all the choices that he wanted. So, you also shouldn’t feel like you have to apply to a lot of schools. In terms of diversity of schools, I would say the criteria for diversity to me—you should apply to some big schools and some small schools. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a big school. You might be a student who’s a better fit for a small school. You don’t need to arbitrarily apply to a lot of different types of schools. But you should apply to several schools that you’re very confident that you’ll get into where you’re in that top quartile academically, schools that accept more than 10% of applicants, you should apply to some schools that you absolutely know that you can afford, and you apply to some schools that you love if there’s a path to making them work for your family financially.

Ptak: Last question we wanted to ask you is, reflecting on all that you’ve learned personally and in your research about the college funding and application process, what are the key things you’d like to see changed to make it work better for students and their families?

Garcia: It’s such a good question and it’s hard to narrow it down to a few things. One of the challenges about the college process is just how opaque it is, and so transparency would be a big thing. But I think the bigger issue beyond transparency is the complexity of all the pieces. The FAFSA is really complex and even despite simplification it will still be complex. And it’s especially complex for first-generation students and low-income students, the people who need the resources that the FAFSA provides the most. So, I would like to see that truly simplified. To me, truly simplifying the FAFSA is things like if you’re eligible for free and reduced lunch in high school, you should be eligible for a Pell Grant without filing the FAFSA and your expected family contribution should be a certain number that’s somewhere within the range of Pell eligibility.

I’d also like to see as parents focus more on what’s best for our children instead of what’s best in the eyes of U.S. News & World Report. College is like youth sports on steroids. When you hear parents talking about where their child is applying, where they’ve been accepted, where they’re going—I have a kid who’s going to a very unselective school, and he’s had a great experience and he has a great job coming out of it. Not only that, but he’s succeeded in ways that have surprised me and I’m just thrilled with the person that he’s become at this college. I have another child who’s done really well at a different school. But if we as parents focus more on what makes our children successful academically and socially and what works for us financially and use that as a guide to our college choices, I think that will decomplexify the system a whole lot.

I think one of the areas where we really fall short is our lack of public policy support for education, and by that I mean not just dollars for education, but actual support for education. As a society, we need more nurses and engineers and yet getting into nursing school is like getting into Harvard. Our educational system should be supporting our societal needs much better than it has and not just by making loans and small grants available for students. So, it shouldn’t be as difficult as it is to get into a degree path for a field that we have massive shortages around. But that’s a function of having a higher level of public policy support than we have and having colleges focused on serving the larger community, the larger society, as opposed to primarily the students who are enrolled at their institution.

Jeff Ptak: And I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is personal finance expert and author Ramit Sethi. Ramit's first book "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" published in 2009 was a best-seller. The new edition of the book came out last year. Ramit is the founder of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com and Earnable, an online course created to help entrepreneurs start and accelerate their businesses. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford.

Ramit, welcome to The Long View.

Ramit Sethi: Thanks for having me.

Benz: We're really excited to have you here. Your book is called "" I Will Teach You to Be Rich."" You also are in charge of IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com. In the book rich doesn't simply mean amassing a lot of assets. How do you define it?

Sethi: Well, one of the key insights of my work over the last 16 years has been that rich is quite different for each of us. And interestingly, rich might be your ability to go out and buy $1,000 cashmere sweater. Great. No problem with that at all. Go for it. For others, it might be being able to pick up your son or daughter from school at 3 pm. That's also a rich life. But one of the things that I like to do when I start off talking about money with people, I don't talk about compound interest, I don't talk about asset allocation. I start off by asking people what their rich life is. And it is absolutely fascinating how people respond to that question.

Ptak: One concept you discuss is called the money dial. What does that mean? And what are some examples?

Sethi: Well, this was the exercise that I created when I wanted to help people understand what they actually want to do with their money. Interestingly, when you ask people, what is your rich life, they almost always give you the same three answers. The first one is freedom. I want to do what I want, when I want. Then sometimes they will say, I want to be able to pay off my debt. That's sort of a dim dream, I think. If your only goal is to get to zero, that's not very motivational for people. And then, finally, you have people who talk about their third point with money and what their rich life is, is very vague when you ask that question.

So, when I push them on what their rich life is, what do you want, suddenly, things change. And the way that I did this was I asked them, what do you love spending money on, love, not like love? And everybody's eyes light up. They start smiling. Everybody's got one thing. The most common answers here are eating out. That's number one. Second is health and wellness. And the third travel, okay. After that there's a steep decline. But there are a variety of different categories. Mine happens to be convenience.

And then, I asked them a question like this, I say, what if you could quadruple your spending? What would it look like and what would it feel like? And this is really a pivotal moment for people. Because most people have never thought about spending more on the things they love. They've actually only been berated to spend less on everything. When you ask them what it would look and feel like to spend more on eating out, they typically have the same response. Well, I'd probably have to go on a diet because I eat out four times a week. But I push them gently. And I remember speaking to a young man in DC while I was on a book tour. And he said the same thing about going on a diet. And I said, really? What would you do if you could quadruple the amount you spend? And he started looking off into space. And he finally said, I have a list of every Michelin starred restaurant in town, I would go there. And I leaned in, I said, who would you take with you? And he said, my family because they've never been able to afford to go to those places. That is a money dial. That is what turning up that dial can look like. And once you know what you want to spend money extravagantly on, then you can cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't care about.

Benz: Well, that's what I wanted to ask about. How do the boring old financial jobs fit into this framework like, you know, saving for retirement or building an emergency fund? Retirement security is probably never going to be anyone's money dial, but it has to be done, right? So, how do you fit the two things together, the sort of more aspirational vision for your life alongside the things that you know you have to do?

Sethi: Well, I've worked with millions of people through my website, through my newsletters, social media, books and tours. My conclusion also based on my work in psychology and behavioral change, is that we want to start and meet people where they are. And I find that the minute anyone starts talking about money, whether it's in a financial advisor's office or reading a 401(k) brochure, they're already on defense, because most people don't know about personal finance, but they know enough to know that they're doing something wrong. And that's not a good sign to help them absorb and learn and make moves.

So, if it were up to me and I were advising financial advisors on their primary first conversation, there would be no math allowed, there would be no compound interest, there would be no words like estate allowed. Not at all. The questions are human questions that you might ask your children or your friends or parents. What's important to you, what do you want to do with your life? What does your rich life look like? What if you could spend more on that? These are questions that any person can answer, and they actually want to answer it. People desperately want to talk about their dreams. But until we get that down and set some foundational context for what their vision is of their future, then no amount of interest rates and returns and expense ratios are going to matter.

And I can tell you that many of us have experienced with people who end up in their 60s, let's say, they have some money, but they have no idea what to do. No idea what to do with it. They saved and they did all the right things, but they forgot the most important thing, which is to have a reason why. I remember I was having dinner with somebody in their 60s. And I asked him, if you could go back and give yourself advice in your 20s, what would you tell yourself? Any thought about it for a second? And he said, save more. I would have saved more. And I happen to know his financial situation. He's done fine. He has money. I said, if you'd save more, what would you have done with the extra money? You've got money now. What would you have done with some extra? And he looked at me stumped. It is reflexive. It's almost religious in our culture to save money. Now, that doesn't mean we do it. There's just words around and there's all these commercials out there telling people save and invest in 401(k) and this and that. Doesn't mean we do it. But what we lack is asking people why, what do they want to do and pushing them on it, not accepting the first typically lazy answer, I want to do what I want, when I want. Well, what is that? When you get into that, then suddenly people are much more receptive to these foundational concerns of retirement and tax-advantaged investing, et cetera.

Ptak: I had a couple practical follow-ups. One is defining a rich life that can vary from member to member of a household. And so, the question is how to reconcile between those definitions? And then, also, I would imagine that the definition of rich life is not static. It does change over time. And so, how should one navigate that as well?

Sethi: There absolutely are seasons in life that change. I want to start with that question because I love that one. And one of the things that I observe is the financial-services industry focusing primarily on getting people ready for the rich life in people's 60s and beyond. That's the reason I started I Will Teach You to Be Rich. Nobody was speaking to people of my age at the time I was in college and nobody was talking about the things we wanted to do. We wanted to go out. I wanted to be able to buy around and drinks for my friends. That was a rich life to me. Certainly, it was not thinking about estate planning at age 20. And also, getting advice from people who look and sound like you is profoundly important, that representation really matters.

Of course, over time, those change. We know that there are pivotal moments when people have a family, when they get a new job, potentially if they get divorced, of course, retirement. Those change over time. What is interesting is encouraging people, I think, to seize those seasons and really push it to the limit in whatever season you're in. For example, if you are in--let's just use your 20s for example. Of course, you should save for retirement. And of course, compounding matters more than ever in your 20s. You have a massive opportunity. But there's also opportunities to do things that you cannot do in your 40s, things like take a very long, extended trip. And so, that is part of a financial plan, too. It might not show up in a spreadsheet, but it's part of a rich life. And I find that people are much more receptive when you talk to them and acknowledge the season of life that they are in. You're in your 20s, you want to take a month-and-a-half to go to Europe? Awesome. Let's talk about how to make that happen. Yeah, okay, there'll be some trade-offs. But if you look at this and you decide looking back 20 years from now, would you regret not going? Sounds like it's the right call for you. Okay?

Of course, now, as for the spouse question, or partner question, oh, that's a tricky one. And I really, really love this. I have some first-hand experience being married. And we started off with different money lenses. And that was extremely challenging. And over time, I've been very thankful and grateful that I've been able to go through it on a personal level as well. One thing that I recommend in Chapter 9 of my book, when two people sit down to talk about money, usually it devolves into how could you spend so much on coffee and these sort of $3 questions, when in reality, most people should be asking $30,000 questions.

My advice is, if you are sitting down for the first time to really have a series of money conversations, again, we're not talking math in the first, second, maybe even third meeting, we're talking about how were you raised around money, what'd your parents say at the dinner table? What's your first memory? What's something you've changed your mind about with money since you were a kid? Just really getting into it. And of course, being vulnerable yourself. The other more tactical advice that I give is, when you set your first savings goal together, make it fun. What's a trip we want to go on together? What's an experience we want to create? Let's save for that. Because money then becomes a source of pleasure, not simply a source of beratement or feeling bad about yourself.

Benz: You reference that people spend too much time on the $3 questions and they should be thinking about the $30,000 questions. So, what are those $30,000 questions?

Sethi: Negotiating your salary, making sure you're working at the right job. That's a skill. It's not purely luck. You can learn how to navigate the career space. And you can learn how to negotiate salaries. We routinely teach people how to negotiate $10,000 or $20,000, salary increases. Asset allocation, that's a big win. That matters far more than any amount of lattes you could ever buy. Your fees, the fees that you were paying. Of course, we know the importance of fees as investors and yet, think about how much time we spend, whether it'd be cutting coupons or rate-chasing as opposed to really evaluating once a year, are we paying the proper fees for the advice we're getting, not just financially, but in all different parts of our life.

Your relationship, that's a big win. That's a big financial win as well, making sure that you have the right relationship, and that you are aligned on your spending. And also, another big win, your earning. So, this is something that I think is typical more of my millennial readers, people in their 20s and 30s. They are increasingly looking at additional ways to make income beyond their job. Many of them have jobs, but many of them are using, whether it's our programs, or they're doing it on their own, to start a business, started on the side, eventually, maybe even go full time. And we have many multiple six-figure earners, we also have folks who are making an extra $5,000 a month, or even $500, and that's quite meaningful. So, there are approximately 5 to 10 big wins in life and a big win, if you get that right, you never have to worry about appetizers or lattes again.

Ptak: How do you apply this ethos to people that are dealing with issues of income security and also uncertainty around healthcare security? I know that they would have their own definition of rich life, but I would tend to think that it's going to be a very, very pragmatic definition. And so, can you take what you've been describing and apply it to those types of situations as well?

Sethi: Yeah, and I'm so glad you asked about that, because I do believe in personal responsibility and I do believe in educating ourselves and making what we can with the situation that we are given. But I also believe that there needs to be systemic reform, and there are some serious structural issues that go on. So, it's one thing to say, Hey, you know, make a debt payoff plan and try to earn more. That's great, and you should do that. But if you are one step away from going bankrupt because of healthcare laws, that's not acceptable, especially in the United States of America. Now, as for practical and more tactical advice, I find that 95% of the people I talk to who are in debt do not know how much debt they actually hold. Why would they? It's a painful number to reckon with. So, it's easier to simply not open up that envelope.

The second thing is that 99% of them do not have a debt payoff plan. They don't even know how much they owe; how could they know when it's going to be paid off? The simplest and really most effective thing that you can do if you're in debt is to get all your payments together. If you don't even know how much you owe and who you owe it to, call them up and make those companies do the work for you. How much do I owe? What's my balance? What's my interest rate? And what is my current debt payoff date, if I go, as I've currently been going. Then you can work with these companies, whether it's a credit card company, student loan company, car loan. And there are many people--I remember speaking to somebody who is in $350,000 of student loan debt. That's crushing. That's crushing. And thanks to some recent laws, that's also nondischargeable. He found that with tweaking his payments a little bit paying an extra 50 to $100, which he could manage, he could shave off years of that debt payoff plan.

So, there certainly are things you can do. There are no silver bullets. There is no magic script that you can use. You can negotiate down APRs on your credit card. A lot of people don't know that. And some of these debtors actually do want to help you out. But the larger key is making a plan and then automating the execution of that so that it is not dependent on any motivation or inspiration every day. That is the way that you can slowly, methodically and healthily pay off that debt.

Benz: You've called traditional budgeting pointless. Why is that? And what's a better way to get in touch with how you're spending?

Sethi: Well, most people don't do it. And they don't want to do it. So, it's pointless and ineffective. Because if we simply look at the efficacy, it just doesn't work. Who wants to look at how much they spent last month, knowing that they probably overspent and then having to reckon with that? It's like people don't like to get a cavity taken out. It's like, do you want to do that every month? And then also correlate that with how poorly you ate and why you're causing yourself to get cavities? No, we don't want to do that. So, we don't, and guess what, life goes on. That's how most Americans live. They don't have a budget, and life goes on. It's fine until one day, it's not. And I wanted to change that for a long time.

When I started writing my blog in 2004 and eventually went on to write a book, I purchased many of the other personal finance books out there. And what I discovered was in Chapter 1, many I would say most of the other money books start off by saying, let's find out how much you spent last month. And that's a great way for people to politely close the book and say, No, thank you, I'm going to put that right back on the bookshelf. Nobody wants to do it. So, instead, I wanted to create a more forward-looking plan.

Yeah, let's look at the past. Let's analyze what we spent for the last roughly four weeks. It's not going to be perfect, but it's 85% of the way there. More importantly, let's plan out where we want our money to go. So, blank slate. If you could have your money go anywhere, where would it go? Now, it's really fascinating. If you ask the average person who's not educated in personal finances at all, they actually have no idea about some of these basic rules. They don't know 28-36. They don't know 10% for savings or investments. They don't know these numbers. And that's okay. So, they start off with this idea that's not particularly sophisticated. But what I did was with the help of my community and the millions of people who've been reading, I figured out how much people typically are spending on fixed expenses, et cetera. And when you give people a benchmark and you explain why, suddenly they realize, okay, I can make that work. And sometimes when they can't, I can't really afford to put 10% in savings. Okay, what am I going to do? Well, you know what, I can do 7% this year, and then I'm going to focus on increasing my salary and my car payment is going to end. So, I'll be able to do that next year. Okay, great.

People are very, very comfortable once they have a benchmark of saying, look, I may not be able to hit it perfectly, but I'm generally on track and that makes me feel good. That is so profoundly different from look at a spreadsheet full of things you spent on last month and then figure out what to do about it. That's like it's empty. You're throwing people into a national park and saying, make your way out of here. It's impossible, it's very difficult. So, instead, what I want to do a conscious spending plan, look forward, decide where you want your money to go. Here are some benchmarks that are very helpful. And if you can hit these, you are good. You don't have to worry about anything else. Just hit these basic numbers of savings and investment and the rest is guilt-free spending. You could spend it on whatever you want.

Ptak: So, how do you think that the pandemic has affected the way some of those you work with have set their conscious spending plans? I would have to think that they would be revisiting some aspects of those plans, just given the way circumstances have intervened. And so, can you talk a little bit about maybe what sort of changes you've been making in consultation with clients and whether you've revisited any aspects of your framework in light of what we've experienced?

Sethi: Yes, it's a great question. I have. As soon as the pandemic happened, I decided to make some very rapid changes. And first, my wife and I left the city. We left it pretty early on, and even so early that our friends were like, what are you doing, and maybe it's I've watched too many Batman movies and I've seen bad things happening in cities. I said, we should get out of here. So that was first thing was taking care of my family. Second thing was taking care of my team. So, we initiated a COVID stipend for anyone who needed additional funding for whatever reason, groceries, for their parents, or their family or themselves. And then, we also initiated a debt freeze, or a payment freeze, I should say, for any of our customers. So, we have tens of thousands of customers. Anyone who needed to put their payments on hold, we initiated that proactively, no problem. And then, we raised a bunch of money for Feeding America and other organizations.

Finally, when I spoke to my readers, looking at the economy, as it got worse and worse, I did make one change. I recommended that they increase their emergency fund savings from six months to 12 months. Now, that is quite aggressive. And the reflexive response for some was, that's crazy, you're telling me that I should stop investing, so I can put money in a savings account that's basically losing money. I find that interestingly a lot of people who really should be the beneficiaries of being financially conservative take unnecessary risks. In truth, the extra return you might get for a few months of savings in the grand scheme of your life, it's not really that big. But having the safety and security of a six- to 12-month emergency fund can truly be a lifesaver if your job or entire industry goes away. So, I did advise them on that.

The other thing that I recommended was a three-part framework. And that framework is first play defense. So, get your 12-month emergency fund in order. If you've got that, next, continue your investing plan as usual. We know that it's not about timing the market, it's time in the market. And then, finally, go on offense. If you have done defense, and you've continued that you still have money, which a lot of people do, although it's not really palatable to talk about it publicly, go on offense, look for opportunities, whether it's starting a business, many of my Earnable students have done that, whether it's looking for investment opportunities, whether it's simply writing a big check to a charity or a family member that needs it. Go on offense and use your money in a meaningful way. That's a three-part framework that I have adapted based on COVID. And it's really helped people understand what to do in a time like this.

Benz: You referenced the importance of having an emergency fund and enlarging it potentially at this time. Do you like the idea of automating that for people like maybe embedding that in terms of workplace retirement savings, where they have an option to save short term in some fashion as well? Seems like people really struggle with getting their emergency funds together.

Sethi: Yes, I mean, I'm a huge fan of automation, in any and all regard. So, when I was back in college, studying human behavior and psychology and technology, and just looking at what happens, for example, when firms introduced automated 401(k) contributions, right? You could spend the next 50 years educating people about tax advantages, or you can simply make 401(k) opt out. Make it automatic, boom, compliance jumps above 90%. And so, the more we can automate these things, the better. And I think this is a really important point for anyone in the financial-services industries.

Let's remember this. nobody really cares about being a financial expert. I want to say it again, because it's so important. Nobody cares about being a financial expert. They don't want to. This is really important. All they want is for their money to go to the right places and for them to be safe and okay. That's it. And so, we make a profound mistake when we give people a 300-page document and a Monte Carlo analysis. We say, here you go, there you go, that's your life. Nobody cares. You would think they would care because they claim that money is the most important, but they care in the way that they can approach it. And that is why when I talk about money, whether it's on Instagram--like yesterday when I talked about some myths about raising taxes on the rich, I used examples that resonate with them. If they want to read the math, I can talk about the math. But most people want to be approached with their money in a way that resonates with them.

So, for automation, most people do not want to manually go and transfer things. They may want the outcome of that. Of course, they want a nice savings account that's growing. But every month, they're motivated month one, month two, okay, they'll do it, month three, they got something else going on. It's, I think, a sign of humility and understanding when we acknowledge we are imperfect as human beings. And that doesn't mean we're bad. It simply means that we should use systems to make up for our flaws. If you tried to get me to manually invest every single month, I'd probably do it three, four, five, six months in a row, maybe month seven, I would forget. I know that. I acknowledge that. That's a human weakness. So, I set up automation. And the more we can do that for ordinary and frankly, sophisticated people, the better, because people are more than happy to tweak the system once or twice if they know that it's going to provide ongoing benefits. It's when you demand people pay attention for the rest of their lives to something that becomes very difficult for people to actually adhere to it.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to one of the three elements that you mentioned in your framework, which is this notion of going on offense, which I think is very intriguing, and I think actually will hold an appeal to a lot of people. But at the same time, the pandemic can be a difficult environment in which to make big life choices. And so, how have you worked with those that you work with, to help them navigate that making sure that if they are going to make a big life choice, they're doing so in the correct state of mind, knowing how much pressure, I suppose, we're all under right now, given the environment.

Sethi: In order to make these big life choices, I intentionally made that the last step in the framework. I don't want somebody who has no emergency fund, who has one month of investments, suddenly deciding that they want to pack up, move, try some crazy investment, change jobs. I don't want that. It's risk upon risk upon risk, it's too much. So, therefore, I intentionally advise people first play defense. I want that emergency fund up. Second, I want you to continue your investing plan. If you don't have an investing plan, now is the time. Go read my book or read any other book. And then, third, and only if you've done those other two things, then you have earned the right to play at this level. This is a methodical approach. But when I share why, people intuitively get it.

We all know that when we were kids, we earned the right to watch TV after we finished our homework. We've known this principle since we were children. It's only though as adults that we want everything all at once. And there's really nobody to tell us no. Because of the trust I build up with my readers over the last 16 years, I tell them what I believe, I tell them exactly what I'm doing. I tell them the accounts that I use, the banks that I love, the banks that I hate. I'm very, very transparent with them. And I even tell them that people like me, I should be taxed more. And they've never heard somebody talk like that. Wow, somebody who's actually advocating for himself to be taxed more. What? So, they know that they're here and it's straight, whatever I tell them. And thanks to my business model, I create products, they buy it, if they find value, they keep them. So, it's a very straightforward aligned business model. We don't do commissions or anything like that.

And so, when somebody like me says, look, you got to earn the right to be able to play at that level, they understand that. And so, although it might be a little unpalatable, Oh, I have to focus on savings for the next six months, that's so boring, it's earning nothing in my bank account. They understand there's a bigger picture. And they remember, we always start with what is your rich life. So, whether it's traveling five-star resorts, or whether it's going to taking six months off to go build houses in a different country or even here in America, they understand that we are working toward each of our rich lives. That's why they are willing to take it step-by-step as opposed to trying to jump to the more advanced stuff right off the bat.

Benz: So, it seems like the financial-services industry is really warming up to this idea of helping clients align their finances with their aspirations and their life goals. But I guess some of it strikes me as kind of marketing spin. So, if I'm a consumer and I'm attempting to discern, like who's good at this and who is just trying to get money so that they can manage it, how do I figure that out?

Sethi: Well, Christine, I'm absolutely shocked that you would accuse the financial-services industry of pure marketing. I am shocked that you would say that. How could you? Yes, it's true. I think, overall, it's a good thing that the financial-services industry is realigning to focus on what people want, what they actually need. I think there are some really interesting business model challenges. I've spoken to several advisors who I really like and respect. And they point out, I think, quite accurately that what's more valuable to the client is behavioral advice. However, most people are not really willing to pay for that. And so, that's certainly a challenge going forward.

I will say that, in my opinion, the financial-services industry should be advocating first and foremost for their clients to be put first. I think the reflexive arguments against the fiduciary rule are nonsensical. I mean, it's actually unbelievable some of the stuff that I saw in the press. Some firms and companies claiming that if they have to be fiduciaries and put their clients first, fewer Americans will get good financial advice, because they can't afford to give it to them. They actually put that in writing. I can't believe it. What type of industry or firm would actually say that publicly? With that said, the advisors who stand out are the ones, in my opinion, who are of course, putting their client first. But that's really just table stakes. They're connecting with them in interesting and engaging ways. They're writing content, they're also creating their own methodologies of how to reach people, and how to connect with them. In other words, they're not starting off by talking about what is your retirement goal? That's not their first question in the first meeting or the first day at all. They're talking about what's your life like, tell me about it. What would you do differently?

So, yeah, there is some element of marketing. I agree. Again, financial services is known for that. But in general, I do want ordinary Americans to have access to great information about money. And personally, I just wish things were a little easier. I've spent 20 years studying money, understanding it, doing it on my own, helping millions of people. You shouldn't have to do that to get good at money, you really shouldn't. Things should largely go well if you do a few basic things. You should automatically be contributing to your 401(k). You should automatically have a savings account. You should automatically understand, do I have enough, is getting a house actually a good decision for me, et cetera. And that, of course, involves a combination of financial services and products; it involves systemic change, government role, and of course, individual responsibility as well.

Ptak: That all sounds like sensible advice. My question would be do those who are trying to achieve some of the goals that you described need a financial advisor, and if they determine they do, should they be paying them 1% of the assets under advisement to get the help that they need?

Sethi: Well, I'm going to tell you what I tell my readers. I tell them that the majority of people do not need a financial advisor, you can do this on your own. And I show them exactly what to do. I show them funds, I show them asset allocation, I show them automation, even down to the level of this is the date on which your transfer should happen from this account to that. Once they set it up, I found over the course of millions of people using my material, they're quite good and quite confident at it. That's fantastic.

Now, there are certain reasons to hire an advisor. And I've been very explicit about what those reasons are and how to hire a good advisor. Also, I've hired an advisor myself, okay? I fit one of those rules, which was I wanted a second set of eyes, a temporary second set of eyes on my investment plan. And I think that depending on how large your portfolio is, or how complex your situation is, for example, you might be in a second marriage, you might have multiple children going to college, you might be starting to think about downshifting retirement. Those are all pivotal moments where you may say, you know what, I'd like to get a second set of eyes, just make sure I haven't missed anything big.

So, there are reasons that you may want to hire an advisor. The average American, I advise them, you can do this yourself, you can certainly get started yourself. And I have to emphasize why I say that. I don't think we should delegate one of the most important things in our life. And this is not the same as delegating your oil being changed or your lawn being mowed or even going out to a restaurant having somebody cook for you. This is profoundly deep. It cuts across everything you and potentially your spouse do.

So, when you ask people in their 40s, what are you worried about? And the primary answer is always the same, money, this tells you, it's got to be something that you yourself are tackling. You're getting in there, rolling up your sleeves and doing it, and you can. As for the people who do hire an advisor for a temporary second set of eyes, or they want a plan, that's fine. I show them how they should interview five different advisors, they should, of course, get along with them, ask them if they're a fiduciary. They should pay an hourly rate. I'm happy if people pay a high hourly rate. Premium service, premium prices, I'm all good with that. They should not pay a 1% fee. I do not support that at all. And I've been very clear about why that is. There's no reason that an ordinary investor should be paying an assets under management fee. As we know from the research, those fees do not produce better returns in investing or in behavioral response either. And so, pay an hourly rate. Even if the hourly rate is high, great, pay it. In the short term, it might seem expensive; in the long term, anything is cheaper than 1% AUM.

Benz: You've recommended robo-advisors for people who need help with their investments. Would target-date funds be a worthy solution as well, especially for people who are just kind of getting their financial footing?

Sethi: I love target-date funds. They're my favorite investment. And I highly recommend them. They're great, because they're simple. They are one investment. They're automatically diversified and automatically rebalanced. I can't recommend them enough to people. And it's funny--when you speak to beginning investors, they've been taught through media, movies that you have to pick stocks and you've got to have big multiple screens with green letters running across. They're almost skeptical when you tell them. No, it's actually just one fund. That's it. And all you need to do is set it up to automatically invest, and you're done. And when you tell them that you should actually be spending less than 60 minutes a month on your finances, they almost don't believe you. The irony is, they're drawn to the more complex, because it seems mysterious. But in actuality, once you get really good at something, you learn that really the crux of success in that field is typically very, very simple. Same with investing, right? Automatic investing consistently, low fees and focus on the long term. It's really simple, almost too simple.

Ptak: Maybe we can talk about what seems like the antithesis of that, which is brokerage accounts like Robinhood, which had become popular among young investors just starting out. The question is, is this a good way for young people to get started investing, in your opinion?

Sethi: No, nobody should be using Robinhood. It makes zero sense. It's toxic for young people in particular, who are now being trained from day one to believe that investing is about randomly picking individual stocks. And I would be willing to bet--in fact, I would be willing to bet a large amount of money that early Robinhood investors will have lower lifetime earnings and lower lifetime investment returns than the average Vanguard investor.

Benz: I want to talk about homeownership. You have argued that many people overemphasize homeownership as a component of a successful financial life. And it's definitely hard to argue that homes are always great investments, but they are the largest source of wealth for many households. And they're also I guess, as an illiquid asset, something that people can stick with, and not tap for short-term needs and so forth. So, I guess, how does homeownership fit in? How do you suggest that people approach that?

Sethi: Yeah, this has been a really interesting conversation that I've had with my readers over the years. My big advice for people when it comes to buying a house is that I want them to run the numbers. It seems so simple and innocent. Of course, Ramit, we'll run the numbers. But as I've dug deeper into it, I've discovered so many things about buying a house. In this country, real estate is religion. And we grow up being taught these phrases like you're throwing money away on rent, don't pay your landlord's mortgage, or they're not building more land. And so, people grow up without really thinking about it. But eventually ""knowing"" that they should buy a house, and this is so funny. You hear people talking about this. One of the favorite things on the Internet is to complain about how expensive weddings are. No matter what if you write about weddings, somebody's coming out, popping out of the comments section and saying, oh my god, you spent that much? Well, I spent $52 and we sort of hot tamales at our wedding and we're still married 30 years later. That's such a waste of money. And people will then say, yeah, we could have taken that money and bought a house with it. Notice that the wedding and the house are always tied together.

Now, where do you think that came from? You have people who are largely financially unsophisticated. You never hear folks talking about investing, target-date funds, dollar-cost averaging. But suddenly, when it comes to a wedding, they're talking about, oh, we would just prefer to just put that down for a down payment. Where'd that come from? And the answer is that there's been a systematic marketing campaign from The National Association of Realtors. The government and of course, our parents, who bought houses, telling us that you need to buy a house. That's the best investment there is.

When I started to dig into this, I became extremely fascinated because if you actually truly run the total cost, you include what I call the Phantom costs of buying a house and you compare it to investing in an S&P 500 fund, you will often find that housing is not a great investment. Not always, but a lot of times. I have lived in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. I've rented in all of those by choice. It would have made no financial sense for me to buy. I want to say that again because it is so counterintuitive. It still makes no financial sense for me to buy. And I could buy right now. So, I'm a renter by choice. I'm sure one day I will buy. I'm also sure that when I do, I'm sure the house is going to be great. I'm also sure it's probably going to be a terrible financial decision.

What happens is you have somebody saying, you know, my grandma bought a house in Texas in 1970 for $200,000 and she just sold it for $600,000. She made $400,000 of pure profit. But of course, if we dig into the numbers and we look at how much she spent on maintenance and taxes and interest and then we compare all that plus your down payment to what you could have made by just simply investing in a S&P 500 fund for 0.1%, you often find that people could have made much more by renting, key being they need to invest the difference. That's a big, big key.

My point with this is not to tell people that buying a house is a bad decision. That's not my point. Like I said, I will buy a house someday. My point is that a rich life involves deep thinking about your big decisions and buying a house is perhaps the biggest financial decision for most people. I don't want people going into it unknowingly. I don't want them getting charged crazy fees on their investments. I don't want them investing in things that are not properly diversified and I don't want them buying something that for a lot of people ends up making them house poor and because of the way that all the fees are levied and obscured, they don't actually realize, wow, this house is costing me a lot more than I thought.

So, I'm giving people permission, run the numbers, question what you've been told about buying a house. It may be right for you, or it may not. But you should never feel pushed into a large financial decision. You should get clear on the difference between what is a luxury purchase and what is an investment. And you should get educated about all of your different options because you have lots of options to grow your money. And if you want to use housing, that's fine. Understand the trade-offs. If you want to do a target-date fund, great. If you want to do all the above, great. But I don't want somebody using phrases that they were taught when they were seven years old--don't throw money away on rent. That's not what I want. I want my I Will Teach You to Be Rich readers and everybody listening, take the unconventional choice, run the numbers, decide what is right for you and your rich life. I have found that to be very, very rewarding.

Ptak: I wanted to go back to an earlier question on Robinhood specifically, but maybe we will widen it out to the concept of learning by doing and specifically, learning by making mistakes. And I guess, it's sort of tied in with the you only live once sort of ethos, right, YOLO. And I know that one of the defenses that some have mounted for things like Robinhood is that you kind of get it out of your system and you learn from some of those mistakes. And so, maybe to broaden out in your experience, is that important or really should we focus more on precisely defining what is truly important to us in leading a rich life and try to minimize mistakes like those?

Sethi: Everyone's going to make mistakes. I made them myself. When I started off investing as a teenager, my dad helped me open up a custodial IRA and I thought that investing meant picking stocks. So, I picked three random stocks. Two of them went bankrupt. And I quickly learned I didn't know what I was talking about and I spent the next few years really learning about money and testing my approaches on myself and then slowly with my readers. I never hold it against anyone if they make mistakes, particularly when they're starting off. Hey, you know you're going to get an overdraft fee. Okay, great. Use the script in Chapter 1, get that reversed. Hey, you might pick the wrong account. No big deal. Let's fix it while it's small because soon your numbers are going to get quite large and those mistakes can be costly.

If people were to join a service like Robinhood with the mindset of, you know what, I'm going to experiment with this for three months. I'm going to allocate $1,000 and that's what I'm using to invest. And then, at the end, that's it. That's my cap. Great. That's not what's happening. If you look at people in forums and subreddits discussing this, that is not what's happening at all. We have people leveraging. We have people borrowing. We have people who are surrounding themselves in an echo chamber of others who are encouraging day-trading. And long-term sophisticated investors know that net-net these folks are going to lose money. What's even worse, they're going to create bad financial habits that I argue will last the rest of their lives.

So, it's no problem to make mistakes. We're all going to make mistakes at any age, at any level of sophistication, but there are certain things that are so dangerous that we should be extremely careful about trying without clear rules and guidelines for ourselves and this is one of them.

Benz: We've had a couple of guests from the FIRE movement on the podcast, and sometimes I see your perspective being cast as sort of the opposite of FIRE. Is that your view? Are you anti-FIRE?

Sethi: No, I'm not anti-FIRE. I know a lot of the FIRE folks and I think the FIRE community is especially interesting. First off, anything that gets Americans to increase their savings rate in general I think is a good thing, okay? Personally, I do not encourage extreme frugality. And one of the principles that I share with I Will Teach You to Be Rich is live life outside the spreadsheet. Meaning, at a certain point you've won the game. You already know your early retirement date, or you've already accumulated enough to retire at whatever age you want. Fine, great. Congratulations. At that stage, get out of the spreadsheet. Running another analysis and tweaking your portfolio by 0.01% is not going to change anything.

With the FIRE community, one thing that I've encouraged when I did another podcast with Mad Fientist was what are you going to use the money for. And if your answer is, I want to do what I want when I want, that's not an answer for someone that has spent years optimizing for the next step of life. My encouragement with I Will Teach You to Be Rich and my approach is, let's start living that life now. There are things that many of us have experienced, friends or parents, who get to a certain age, they have big plans and then something happens. They get struck by an illness. Something unexpected happens and they simply can't do it. That's the last thing I want for my readers. There are also certain things that you can't simply start older in life. It's more difficult. Folks often on some of these subreddits are talking about, you know, when I retire, I want to learn a different language and I want to travel and this and that. Awesome. I love it. But all we need to do is look at the last two years of anyone's life to have a fairly good predictor of what they're going to do in the next two years of life. If you've been traveling now, you're probably going to travel more later. If you haven't, I would say it's unlikely that you're going to dramatically change your life in retirement.

I heard a very fascinating principle related to early retirement, et cetera, which was a relative of mine said, we really have 20 years of peak spending--not talking about saving, talking about spending--40 to 60. Now, we can disagree on what those numbers might be. But he said, look, early on, you don't have any money, fine. But at a certain point, whether it be health reasons or interest reasons or family reasons, you're not going to go on a backpacking trip around Europe when you're 78. So, you have these peak 20 years to spend. Now, let's make sure, of course, we don't run out of money, of course. Let's also be as intentional about spending. What are the seasons of life that I'm in right now? What's important to me? Is it children? Is it my spouse? Is it my family? Is it charity? Is it a venture? Let's really dial in on those. Knowing we have a finite amount of time and we should spend as much time on that as we do tweaking our investments and tracking our spending and running a Monte Carlo analysis.

So, I have no problem with the FIRE community. I love anybody that encourages us to think deeply about what our rich life is and increase our savings rates. I do think that money alone is not a rich life. You can have $1 million; you can have $10 million. That's just a number in a spreadsheet. What you do with it, that is when you truly craft and create your rich life.

Bryan Armour: Index Investing Is a Runaway Freight Train

A Morningstar researcher discusses rising passive share, bitcoin ETFs, and the future of active management.

(Please stay tuned for important disclosure information at the conclusion of this episode.)

Dan Lefkovitz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Dan Lefkovitz, strategist for Morningstar Indexes.

Christine Benz: And I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Lefkovitz: Our guest this week is our colleague, Bryan Armour, who is director of passive investment strategies research, North America, for Morningstar Research Services. Bryan is also editor of the ETFInvestor newsletter. Before joining Morningstar in 2020, Bryan spent seven years working for Finra, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, conducting trade surveillance and investigations specializing in exchange-traded funds. Prior to Finra, he worked for a proprietary trading firm as an options trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bryan holds a BA in Economics from the University of Illinois and the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.

Before we begin the discussion, I should say that I’m part of Morningstar’s Index group and we license to ETF providers, but we will not be discussing any investable products tracking a Morningstar Index today. In fact, Bryan’s team doesn’t cover them.

Bryan, thanks so much for joining us on The Long View.

Bryan Armour: Thank you both for having me.

Lefkovitz: Absolutely. Well, we wanted to start off with a major milestone that we hit recently in the US market, not referring to the bitcoin spot ETFs that started trading, but the fact that passive strategies now account for the majority of assets in funds and ETFs and on a global basis, passive share is about 40%. Our colleague, John Rekenthaler, recently wrote that index funds have officially won. So, do you see anything that could slow the rise of index investing?

Armour: It’s a runaway freight train right now. But no, it’s been a long, persistent trend. And I think the real reason why it’s done so well is because of the cost story. Passive investing comes with lower fees, lower trading costs, greater tax efficiency. And that’s going to be hard for active managers to beat consistently because they have to beat passive on a gross basis and then by more than the difference in their fees as well.

To take a step back, indexes are concentrated right now, market-cap-weighted indexes. And so, I think the S&P 500 is the highest concentration in top 10 holdings in the past 50-some years. And so there is an opportunity for active investors, I think. And you have these zombie flows that are coming from passives where it’s like savings come in and just go out to the market where active managers could really find an advantage. And so, a rough stretch for cap-weighted indexes might not be enough to move passives off the mark. But the best chance for active managers to get back on top is to cut costs and take away passives’ superpower.

Benz: Well, we want to delve into some of those themes and some of the performance trends that you and the team have observed. But sticking with fund flows: It had been the case that investors were preferring actively managed fixed-income funds, but even that seems to have shifted toward passive over the past several years. Can you talk about that because it seems like the fundamental case for an active strategy in fixed income is stronger than is the case for equities, but maybe you can delve into that and what you’re seeing in terms of flows?

Armour: So, in general, we’re seeing—if you draw a straight line, it’s from active mutual funds, going out of active mutual funds into passive ETFs. And it’s generally true across the board for fixed income, equity, and so on. And so, it does make the most sense, I think, to go passive in the areas where there’s the richest information embedded in prices of stocks, for example, or US Treasuries as a fixed-income example. So, large-blend-style funds, those types of stocks have the widest coverage, the fastest reaction to changes in information about the companies. And so, they tend to be priced very well, and passives can really free ride that pricing by active managers and kick it back to investors for a lower cost. Where there are some issues, like you said, or how do you index the bond market? And if you go by market weighting, then you end up investing the most in the most indebted issuers. So, in some cases, for core bonds, for things like Treasuries—very liquid market. And so, those are fit for passive investing. And if you look at like an ag-bond fund, that’s a huge chunk of the ag right now is Treasuries. But something like muni bonds, for example, there is some inefficiency in selecting munis. They’re not taking part in the issuance. So, to some extent, they might get some of the leftovers. But just in general, it’s easier for investors to understand what a passive fund is going to do. And those expectations and low fees are a good fit for most people.

Lefkovitz: And it seems like a lot of advisors these days might be ETF only. I know you’ve written about models as well, model portfolios. What role are they playing in flows?

Armour: So, there’s been a shift in distribution in that sense where advisors are moving to fee-based advice instead of commission-based. And what that means for investors is that they’re going to push toward cheaper funds, which often means ETFs or index mutual funds. And then if they do go active, then—ETFs are growing a menu, and we’ve seen model portfolios come as a really good option for advisors where they can just follow the script rather than spending too much time with asset allocation. And so model portfolio gives you the full portfolio of here are all the ETFs that you can invest in to follow the model. And it’s been a really good tool for investors, and it’s pushed some flows around, too. We just had the Model Flows Landscape report come out recently from Manager Research here at Morningstar. And model portfolios are growing extremely fast. And iShares, for example, is one of the biggest model portfolios. They work really closely with advisors to help them understand the changes that they’re making and give them performance attribution analysis and things like that to pass on to clients. But last March, they shifted from their iShares ESG Aware ETF, ESGU, to their Quality Factor ETF, which is QUAL. And that led to a $5 billion outflow of ESGU into QUAL. And so, it’s ending up having some pretty significant ramifications in the market.

Benz: Let’s talk about providers and what you’re seeing in terms of flows to providers. It seems like the big three—Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street—have grown market share, but maybe you could just talk about that, how the spoils do seem to be going to fewer firms.

Armour: The biggest have gotten bigger. And I would even say that Vanguard and iShares are in their own tier now and then State Street is alone in that next tier. But a lot of it has been scale. It’s been being able to scale their operations, scale their strategies, and offer them for low costs, which then put pressure on others to catch up. And we’re at a point where Vanguard might actually catch iShares soon. So, they’ve been winning the flows battle the past few years. But there’s two ways that assets can increase. One is new flows, net investment, and the other is performance of the existing assets. So, Vanguard does have a little bit more of a tilt toward equity assets, which means they could be boosted by a strong stock market and actually take over as the top ETF provider. And then in the active ETF space, there’s been a shift in the largest providers. Dimensional converted their first mutual fund to an ETF about three years ago, and they’ve already taken over as the largest issuer in the active ETF space. And then options-based strategies have been a huge growth engine of active ETFs, and JP Morgan has really benefited from that.

Lefkovitz: Well, we want to get back to all those topics that you just touched on. But I wanted to ask you, Bryan, there’s this perennial question of whether the rise of passive share has led to market distortions. And we had a comment recently from David Einhorn, a prominent hedge fund manager, saying that passive investing has fundamentally broken the market. Wondering if you have a perspective on that?

Armour: It depends where you’re coming from in your perspective on how you’re seeing the market. Because from David’s perspective, I think, he runs long-short hedge funds, for example, and the market is less reactive potentially compared to what it used to be. So, it’s difficult for that type of strategy to efficiently realize mispricings of individual stocks, and shorting is expensive. And so, the longer the lead time to realizing it, the greater the cost and then the more different ways that things can go awry. So, from most investors’ perspectives, though, they don’t have access to these hedge funds. Their investment minimums, there are all sorts of different things that prevent the average investor from buying into these things.

So, it goes back to my original thought on zombie flows. There are opportunities for active managers. Right now, it’s just slower for the market to catch up. The flip side is for average investors, it’s been overwhelmingly positive. You get cheaper, better-performing strategies in most cases. Our colleague Russ Kinnel long showed that low fees are the best predictor of future success. And so, it may not be the best outcome for David Einhorn’s clients, but a vast majority of investors don’t even have access to his hedge fund. And so, it’s a clear net win for investors. And he continued on in his comments after saying that passive investing had fundamentally broken the market by saying that he had adapted. And that’s really, like any strategy from two decades ago, is less likely to work today anyway. So, it’s really adapt or die. And it sounds like he didn’t complain about it. He’s just changed his strategy to better adapt to it.

Benz: Your team’s remit is passive investment strategies. You’re vehicle agnostic. So, I guess, we wanted to ask about index funds, traditional index funds versus exchange-traded funds. It does seem like the flows have very much gone to ETFs. Advisors seem to be articulating a strong preference for ETFs. I guess the question is, is that overdone? I know that there are tax efficiency benefits with ETFs versus traditional index mutual funds, but maybe you can talk about that?

Armour: Comparing index ETFs to traditional index funds, that tax efficiency, that is the crown jewel of ETFs doesn’t apply as much. I would agree with that. First of all, Christine, you wrote a wonderful article for Morningstar.com on this subject. I encourage everyone to read that that’s interested in this conversation. But ETFs tend to have lower fees and tax efficiency. So, the lower fee portion of that still remains. Often their fees are priced closer to retirement plan share classes than retail investor share classes. And then when net flows are going in and out, ETFs can swap holdings for shares in kind, which doesn’t create a taxable event. So, there’s advantages for the ETF, but the problem is that for a traditional index fund, a broad index fund, the fee differences are pretty minimal. And then they’re typically market-cap weighted, so they aren’t trading much and they’re not realizing many capital gains. And so, ETF’s tax advantage is minimal. The difference really comes down to flexibility, I would say, and ETFs are easier to trade in and out of, but those trades come at a small cost like crossing bid/ask spreads, premium or discounts to NAV. But I think this is what Jack Bogle’s initial dislike of ETFs, where it came from, is that the ease of trading could actually be to investors’ detriment if they end up over-trading.

Benz: I wanted to just follow up and stick with this tax efficiency question. I do feel like there’s confusion about fixed-income ETFs being particularly tax-efficient. Like they might have some tax efficiency benefits relative to an active fund, but generally they’re not all that tax-efficient. So maybe you can talk about that, Bryan.

Armour: Unfortunately, interest income is not a capital gain. So, the tax efficiency is purely on capital gains. If the price of the security you hold goes up and you sell it, that price from where you bought it to where you sold it is a capital gain. Interest income is separate from that. It will be taxed as normal income. And so similar also to dividends, these distributions are not incorporated in the tax efficiency of ETFs. And so, if you hold something like long-dated Treasuries and the price of yields go down, then you could potentially have a much more tax-efficient vehicle in an ETF in that circumstance. But for most of the time when prices are relatively stable and most of total return is coming from interest, then the ETF wrapper doesn’t gain any advantage over a mutual fund.

Lefkovitz: I wanted to get back to actively managed ETFs because it’s a space that’s growing very fast and wanted to delve a little bit more deeply. So according to our asset flows data, actively managed ETFs grew 37% in 2023, while passives grew just 8%. Bryan, what’s behind the growth of Active ETFs, do you think?

Armour: I think there are two main reasons. The SEC passed the ETF rule in 2019, which really just made launching ETFs and management of ETFs more efficient by allowing custom-creation redemption baskets is probably the primary reason for Active ETFs. But number two is, Active ETFs are meeting investors where they are. And so, starting with that second point, the increased use of ETFs, the flows going into ETFs really drives asset managers’ interest in launching ETFs and accessing other potential clients. In some cases, it could be, but in most cases, it’s not replacing mutual funds, it’s really just accessing different clients.

For the ETF rule, creation/redemptions, the way the pro rata baskets used to work prior to the ETF rule is, effectively a market maker would go out, buy all the stocks of the S&P 500, for example, in the correct proportion. They would hand those over to an ETF provider. They would get ETF shares back. If they wanted to redeem those ETF shares, then they would get the stocks back. And by doing that in-kind transfer, they never have a taxable event that occurs.

What’s changed is that they no longer get a pro rata slice of the portfolio. Now they have the ability to use custom baskets. So, if you think of an active manager that holds Nvidia, a year ago, it was a $100-something dollars and it got up to $700 recently. And that would be a $600 capital gain you’re sitting on. You could negotiate a custom basket with a market maker to basically get rid of all your Nvidia and take no capital gains on any of that gain. And so, the benefits from custom baskets are tax efficiency. It also pushes some of the trading costs. If you’re using the custom basket for portfolio management, then those trading costs are borne by the market maker, not you, because the transaction is in kind. And then it’s just another tool for PMs. And so, we’ve seen the uptake by some traditional mutual fund providers in response. You can see the increase in products in assets and flows start after 2019 after the ETF rule was enacted. And since then, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Capital Group, T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley have all started to dip their toes into the ETF market.

Benz: I think I heard someone characterize active ETFs as the last gasp of a dying industry, the active asset-management industry. Do you think that’s too harsh?

Armour: No. I mean, yes, I do think that’s too harsh. I disagree with that comment. There are still use cases for active. Like I said, there’s still plenty of opportunities in the ETF wrapper. Mutual fund providers still have a major role in retirement plans. We’ve seen growth of CITs and other vehicles to gain more efficiencies there as well. But we’re still in the early phases of active ETF trend. And just now we’re starting to see portfolio managers accept greater transparency. And so, star managers like BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, T. Rowe Price’s David Giroux launched their first ETFs last year. So, I think it’s actually an exciting time. There’s a lot going on in the ETF space. It’s not the end of asset management overall.

Lefkovitz: Are there areas where you think that active ETFs won’t work so well?

Armour: There are strategies where ETFs aren’t as effective as mutual funds. And a prime example of that would be discretionary active in illiquid markets or small caps or something where there isn’t as much liquidity in the underlying stocks. So, for example, ARKK, the ARK Innovation ETF, there is a direct correlation between flows and performance back in 2020, 2021 when it was going up and down dramatically. But capacity is a concern. It’s something that strategies need to be aware of before going into the ETF wrapper because ETFs can’t close to new investors. And that’s something that has led active ETF providers like Dimensional, Avantis to really lead because they have very well-diversified portfolios. They hold a bunch of stocks and then they tilt things the way they see fit. But the more discretionary active, smaller portfolio-type active strategies don’t seem to do as well in the ETF wrapper.

Benz: I wanted to go back to the tax efficiency of active ETFs, active equity ETFs specifically. It does seem like based on what you’ve said that there would be tax efficiency benefits of the active ETF relative to an active traditional mutual fund. But how about relative to a passive, say, total market ETF, that’s still going to be more tax-efficient, right?

Armour: Well, it’s actually going to be pretty close because there are instances where, depending on how the active manager deploys their strategy in the ETF wrapper—if you look at like Dimensional, Avantis, those are more well-diversified portfolios, but they’ve never realized, or most have never realized, a capital gain. Capital Group, T. Rowe Price have had very minimal capital gains in the ETF wrapper. They had none last year between both of them. So there really isn’t much more to gain from a tax efficiency perspective than that. And so, it just really depends on the strategy though.

Benz: So, the low-turnover piece is crucial, it seems like, right?

Armour: It’s low turnover, but it’s also when you redeem ETF shares, when you have a custom redemption basket, you can put your highest capital gain security as a higher weight in the portfolio and when you redeem it out, you get rid of it and then you can bring it back in at a higher cost basis. And so there are ways to gain tax efficiency beyond just limiting trading. And so that’s really where the biggest advantage has been for active ETFs.

Lefkovitz: Bryan, Vanguard launched some active bond funds in December and your team, when you wrote about them, put active in quotations. Can you talk about those?

Armour: So, Dan Sotiroff does a great job of distilling down the strategies of the new Vanguard bond funds. I believe, one is Core, one is Core-Plus Bond Fund. He put active in quotes because these are well diversified bond funds that are meant to be sit at the core of your portfolio and they’re low cost. In general, they hold duration in line with their benchmarks. So, in a lot of ways, that’s a passive approach where they then add an increment of active is by taking on a little bit more credit risk than their benchmark. And then they look to generate alpha a bit through individual bond selection. But generally, they’re matching the characteristics of their benchmark. And then the fee is very close to passives. So, with incremental benefits, by taking on a little bit more risk and be more thoughtful about which bonds they hold.

Benz: We wanted to ask about active versus passive performance, which you’ve already alluded to, but you’re involved in this semiannual active Passive/Barometer Study, which looks at the success rates for active funds relative to passive in different categories. First, maybe you can talk about what a success rate is, how we define that, and also what you’ve observed having looked at these data over the years?

Armour: So, we’re actually about to publish year-end 2023. So that might even be out by the time this comes out. But we look at success rates for active managers across different categories and holistically. But what we’re looking for is, does an active fund beat the average passive fund? And we look at that as an equal-weighted average of all passive funds within that category. So, we create the peer group, we create the benchmark. This way it’s not like an index where there are no fees, or it’s held to the index construction rules or anything like that. If you were going to pick up the average passive fund, would this active fund beat it? And so, success rates generally over the long term are lower than 50% and in certain areas of the market significantly lower than 50%. And so, if you look at large-blend category, for example, like I alluded to before, there’s incredible coverage of those stocks that sit in that portion of the market. And so, the prices, it’s really hard to carve an edge for an active manager because all the information is priced in. And so, what we’ve seen is over the long term, not only are success rates low, but active managers tend to lag the average passive peer significantly for the ones that do survive. And so that’s one thing with success rates. We look at not only do they beat the average passive fund, but they also have to survive over the period. So over longer-term periods, very difficult to beat passives, but over the short term, things can be pretty noisy.

Lefkovitz: And what have been some areas where active has been successful?

Armour: So, the key is there are two different things that dictate success for active funds. Number one, what are the odds of picking a winner? And then number two, how much can you win versus how much can you lose? And so, indexes prefer liquid markets, ones where the information is embedded in the price quickly and the index funds can represent the market well. Illiquid markets tend to be tougher to index. They usually have to create index rules to get around some of the more illiquid holdings, which creates opportunities for active managers to find advantages over their index peers. So, some of the ones that usually as you go down the market-cap ladder from large cap to mid-cap to small cap, success rates will increase. If you look at like foreign small/mid versus foreign large-blend, actives tend to do better in the smaller-cap area. Real estate is another example. Emerging markets tends to be better for actives. And bonds is more of a mixed bag, but high-yield bonds, active managers tend to do better than core bond funds.

Benz: We wanted to ask about these waves of mutual fund to exchange-traded fund conversions and also ETFs being created as a share class of a mutual fund. You referenced, Bryan previously, DFA having done some of these conversions over the past few years, but maybe you can talk about what’s going on there.

Armour: I believe there’s been about 70 mutual fund ETF conversions at this point. It depends on the strategy at hand. So DFA, they originally moved over some of their tax-managed strategies because the ETF wrapper, for the reasons I discussed, is more tax-efficient. And then also they have these extra portfolio management tools through the use of in-kind creation/redemption baskets. And so, for them, it made sense. If there are complications with strategy fit, like I said before, they can’t close to new investors in the ETF wrapper. So small-cap, more-niche strategies, it might not make as much sense to convert over to ETFs. But generally, what happens is, one day a mutual fund wakes up as an ETF and that track record is still there. But it’s not a panacea for mutual fund managers. DFA has experienced significant inflows, but some of the other ones that converted have actually been seeing outflows. It’s not automatically by joining the ETF market do you see inflows.

And then the other caveat for mutual fund ETF conversions is it doesn’t work if assets are held in retirement accounts. Generally speaking, retirement accounts are built for mutual funds for end-of-day NAV pricing and intraday pricing and nonfractional shares of ETFs make it really hard to switch over. So generally speaking, those with higher retirement account assets or more-niche strategies will find it hard to convert to ETFs.

Benz: And how about the idea of an ETF being created as a share class of an existing mutual fund? I think that was originally a Vanguard innovation, but now other firms have jumped onto that.

Armour: And their patent expired early last year for that. We’ve seen Dimensional, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, a few others apply for that same treatment, and the SEC is currently reviewing those applications. But I think there the advantage is if you do have retirement assets, if you do have some reason, distribution, or whatever reason that exists that you want your mutual funds, but you also want to reach ETF investors, then this is a really good way of doing that. And some of the ETF, if it gets large enough, some of those creation/redemptions, the in-kind creation/redemptions can actually enhance the tax efficiency of the mutual fund share classes then. But the downside for the ETF investors is if investors are redeeming their mutual funds, that could create some capital gains taxes and that could make their way over to the ETF shareholders.

Lefkovitz: Well, let’s get to bitcoin, the moment that many listeners are waiting for. This has been one of the biggest stories in ETF lands in recent years. SEC approved ETFs tracking the spot price of bitcoin. We now have several bitcoin ETFs. So, what have you observed watching this space since these funds started trading in January?

Armour: I think the biggest thing at the beginning was fee wars broke out at the 11th hour. And we saw a very consistent lineup of fees between 19 basis points and 25 if you exclude waivers, the one outlier being Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which converted to an ETF from a private trust into an over-the-counter trust now currently an ETF for the first time. And they are charging 1.5% and big reason why is because they came in with large assets and they have investors in their asset base that have large capital gains they’re sitting on. They know they’re not going to leave and switch to a different bitcoin ETF. But there’s a huge disadvantage for new investors by investing in GBTC. But the rest are all very tight in terms of fees in that 6-basis-point range.

But so far since it started trading, the liquidity ecosystem has been very strong. So, there was a batch approval. Nine new ETFs were approved for trading on the same day and then Grayscale also converted. So, there are 10 new ETFs on Jan. 11. And the existing funds in the market, so GBTC is an example, but also futures-based bitcoin ETFs, and then futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and spot bitcoin itself creates a whole liquidity ecosystem where market makers can hedge between all these different products, and they can look for arbitrage between them. And so, it’s led to really tight bid/ask spreads and very strong liquidity overall. And then they’ve gathered considerable assets. IShares and Fidelity currently lead the pack. I believe there’s now four ETFs over $1 billion. Maybe I shouldn’t even say that at this point because it’s all going to change by the time this goes live.

But they’ve gathered considerable assets. IShares and Fidelity are leading the pack. Bitwise and ARKK are really in that next tier. And they’ve lived up to the billing in terms of volatile performance. Early investors were hit with an immediate 15% drawdown. They’ve already reversed the course and are up since their inception. So overall, it’s gone extremely well for the bitcoin ETFs. But obviously it’s been a volatile few weeks for the ETFs in terms of performance.

Benz: So how about for investors? I guess setting aside the merits of crypto and bitcoin, how about the introduction of ETFs for investors who would be inclined to invest in these assets? Do you think that this is a development for the greater good?

Armour: Well, it’s a positive development for crypto investors. I think it’s better than what currently existed prior to the spot bitcoin ETFs hitting the market. So, there are futures ETFs that had launched in 2021. And there are some frictions in rolling futures that made it underperform the price of bitcoin on its own. GBTC charged 2% and operated like a closed-end fund prior to becoming an ETF. It created all sorts of problems for investors. And crypto exchanges are very expensive to trade on. There’s always a concern of losing your key or how are you going to custody all your bitcoin. So, it’s a good thing for crypto investors in general. But to some extent, I don’t think most investors need to speculate on bitcoin. So, to me, overall, it’s more of a distraction than a benefit for investors.

Lefkovitz: And Vanguard has sat it out. Curious what you make of that.

Armour: So, Vanguard has shown no interest in launching a bitcoin ETF themselves. But a step further, they don’t even make the other bitcoin ETFs available to their investors. And so, they believe it’s speculative. There’s no inherent economic value or cash flows and volatility can wreak havoc on portfolios. Our research has found the same—in terms of it’s very difficult to create a fundamental value for bitcoin. What should it be worth? And we’ve shown that the volatility has a pretty big impact on portfolios, even in a very small allocation like 5% or lower. To some extent, I almost feel like the SEC refusing to approve the spot bitcoin ETF actually gave bitcoin more legs and got more attention for bitcoin. And in the same vein, Vanguard takes the decision out of investors’ hands. And I don’t really feel strongly either way. But in general, sometimes it gives it more power to say no to it.

Benz: Are there any other areas that you’re watching for regulatory approval or maybe new product development? There’s naturally been talk of non-bitcoin crypto ETFs. But I’m wondering if you’ve heard anything about that or other areas?

Armour: The current one in the queue for the SEC is spot ethereum. So, ethereum futures ETFs already exist, but the spot version is the next one waiting on approval. SEC is currently taking the same course as it did with bitcoin. So, it’s been just delaying decisions and waiting until the last second until they get a hard deadline to actually make a decision. But in the same vein as bitcoin, since a futures ETF already exists, they would really struggle with explaining why they would be able to deny spot ethereum versus approve the futures ETF. So, the likely outcome is approval for ethereum, but it is a little bit different than bitcoin, so it remains in flux. Beyond that, we’ve seen all the common product variants that exist in ETF form already filed to come into the market like covered-call versions of bitcoin ETFs, leverage, inverse. But these are things that most investors shouldn’t really take interest in.

Lefkovitz: And then covered-call ETFs that are tracking equity indexes, those have been very popular recently. What do you think is behind that trend?

Armour: I don’t know how the hot trend in the market flipped from meme stocks to covered calls. It’s a little bit of whiplash for investors. But it’s been an astonishing trend in terms of assets and product development. It seems like a covered call is being slapped on every single strategy from single stocks to Bitcoin to S&P 500. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF, JEPI, is the poster child right now. It’s over $30 billion in assets, and we actually cover this ETF. It’s sensible approach, low-risk strategy. But most covered-call strategies are highly tax inefficient. In the same way we were talking about bond ETFs earlier, the premium received from covered calls is not considered a capital gain. So that’s something that will be distributed as income that investors will have to pay taxes on and then reinvest if they’re not using the income for personal uses. And there’s a huge opportunity cost for covered-call ETFs. So, Eugene Fama’s doctoral thesis remains true today where the distribution of market returns have fat tails. So that means there are more extreme gains and losses than expected from a normal distribution of returns. And so, we always talk about downside risk and how that can set investors back. But the same is true of missing out on the best months or years for an investment. And so, it doesn’t make sense to give up the good fat tail and keep exposure to the bad one for covered-call strategies. Because what you’re doing is you’re selling upside and cashing in that expected volatility and taking the income instead of and capping upside. And so, a prime example would be Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF, which is QYLD. It launched in December 2013. And it’s basically like QQQ except with a covered call attached. And it’s trailed QQQ by an annualized 10 percentage points since its launch in 2013. So QQQ over that whole time is up 450%. QYLD is up 100%. So, it’s a substantial opportunity cost that you’re giving up with covered calls.

Benz: Sticking with some of the fads in the ETF space, we wanted to ask about strategic beta, smart beta, factor investing, whatever you want to call it. It seems like just a few years ago, maybe five years ago, that was like the hot topic. Maybe you can talk about what you’re seeing these days in that strategic beta area.

Armour: It’s slowed down for sure. There’s not as much attention from investors or inflows coming in. But generally speaking, there’s still solid strategies. It’s something similar to active investing, except they codified it to track an index of some of the active risks that it takes. And so, it’s still a reasonable investment thesis. The biggest problem has been that market-cap weighted and growth stocks have really done the best. And most of strategic beta is about value. It’s low volatility. It’s some of these things that haven’t kept pace with the market overall over the past decade or so. And so, it’s sort of swung out of favor, but it’s still a very good option for investors.

Lefkovitz: Dividends seem to be an area within strategic beta that remains popular with investors, probably for income. I think your team recently upgraded some dividend-focused ETFs. What was behind that?

Armour: So, when dividend ETFs or strategies are done well, their portfolios can tap into cheap stocks with strong fundamentals, and when done poorly, they can fall victim to value traps. So those are stocks that their prices are dropping alongside their business as their business deteriorates. And so, what we saw from these four dividend ETFs is they have very steady approaches. We’re seeing a lot of consistency in their holdings and their factor exposures over time. They have resilient portfolios, and they really do a good job of addressing the value traps. So, what ends up coming out of that is a strong risk/reward profile. So, it’s typically for those ETFs that are performing similar to the market in terms of returns but with lower risk. And there’s a couple different ways that they get there and between the four ETFs two are dividend growth ETFs, which is, you’re looking more at quality companies that have been steadily growing dividends for eight to 10 years, something like that. And then the high dividend yield strategies look for above-average yielders, but then they pair back some of the risks that can come with that by controlling Vanguard’s High Dividend Yield ETF, for example, takes the top half of dividend yielders and market-cap weights it, and that effectively takes out some of the risk of value traps. But overall, they just give a really solid combination of value, quality, profitability that has tended to work well over the long term and basically all markets.

Benz: I wanted to ask about thematic funds, which is another trend that was really popular just a couple of years ago, things like AI or clean energy. Interest seems to have cooled in those types of products as well. What have you observed in that space?

Armour: It has cooled. Absolutely. I think a lot of investors were burned in 2021, 2022 when thematics were hitting a fever pitch and then markets turned south and a lot of the growth stocks, a lot of the ESG stocks that had done so well in 2020 dropped significantly. And so, it still gets tons of attention. Thematics is nothing new, but it tends to do really well when there’s a market bubble. And so, lots of product development in 2000 and 2007 and 2020 and then shortly thereafter, markets dropped. But AI, I’ve talked a lot about AI ETFs, especially with reporters and that’s something that my friends would ask about. And the problem with AI ETFs is it’s really hard to define the theme and which stocks fit within AI. So, Nvidia is the one that’s held in all AI ETFs, but from there, there’s very little consensus about what stock counts as AI. And some hold Amazon and Apple and Google and Microsoft. And then some hold these small companies that develop chatbots or robots that are more AI directly. And so, there’s not a great way to capture the trend as it currently stands. And that’s often the case with thematics in general. It’s something that will stick around. I think there will still be investors interested in it because the narratives are so strong. But generally speaking, it’s really hard for investors to perform well in those types of ETFs.

Lefkovitz: Bryan, wanted to get your thoughts on direct indexing—taking an index and then making some adjustments, customizing, personalizing. This is an area that got a lot of discussion a few years ago as an alternative, even a rival to ETFs. What are you seeing in the direct-indexing space?

Armour: Direct indexing is hard to make available to everyone. There’s lots of considerations with smaller accounts, how are you breaking up fractional shares, and there’s a lot more risk taken on by the asset managers doing this for smaller investors. So, it’s really targeted toward wealthier investors. But with an ETF, like I said, a lot of the benefit from direct indexing that they talk about is tax-loss harvesting. In general, in ETFs, you can already do that without needing to tax-loss harvest. So, there’s not a significant advantage for direct indexing over just holding an ETF. I think it’d be more about the personalization, the customization of the strategies depending on the particular investor. And so, it remains a high-net-worth strategy. I don’t see it as something that’s going to help the everyday investor.

Benz: I wanted to ask about this annual list that you put out of best and worst ETFs. It’s instructive not just for the specific funds that you’re flagging, but it also gives a sense of what we think are useful vehicles that address a real investment need versus just products that might be beneficial only to the asset manager or sponsor. Can you take us through a couple of case studies on your 2023 best and worst list?

Armour: Definitely. So, this is a fun activity that team all weighs in. We all vote on which ETFs we believe are best and worst. So, we go through like a nomination process and vote on them. And so, there’s a couple of different ways that new ETFs can really break into the market. And so, most of what we think of ETFs like S&P 500 ETF, Total Market—that’s already been done. So, the way our asset managers can differentiate new ETFs is by giving access to something that doesn’t currently exist in the market or improving on an existing asset class.

And so, the two best new ETFs that we highlighted last year—one of them was a BlackRock Flexible Income ETF, which is Rick Rieder’s first ETF that he’s launched. So, he was Morningstar’s 2023 Outstanding Portfolio Manager of the Year. And he’s had a long track record of success and it’s something that’s new that investors couldn’t get in the ETF wrapper before. And so, it’s been just a new way for active ETF investors to engage with ETFs.

And the other best new ETF was Schwab High Yield Bond ETF. What I liked about that one is it was almost like the Vanguard effect in bonds where they come in, they cut expense ratios, and force others to cut with them. This one played out a little differently, though. They came in at 10 basis points, which was the lowest fee on the market in State Street. And State Street then cut their High Yield Bond ETF to 5 in response, and then Schwab shortly thereafter cut theirs to 3. So, in the course of a couple months, the cheapest high-yield bond ETF went from 10 basis points to 3. And then in response, you saw other asset managers cutting their fees, maybe not down to 3 basis points, but to 8, to 5. So, it’s really created a fee war, or at least a fee skirmish in high-yield bonds.

Another good example would be T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF. There’s a mutual fund strategy. It’s multi-asset. This is equity-only, the ETF, but the mutual fund has been closed to new investors for a number of years. So, it’s really opened the doors for investors and to David Giroux and into that strategy, at least the equity portion.

In terms of worst ETFs, it’s often these types of strategies that tend to help the issuer more than investors. And the first one was this 2 times Bitcoin Strategy ETF. So not only is this futures-based but it’s also leveraged to 2 times. It’s just really unnecessary. I mean, bitcoin is highly, highly volatile. There’s been several times where they’ve experienced over 40% drawdowns in the past five years without leverage. And so, this is just unnecessary, and then they add almost a 2% fee on top of it. It’s just really playing into some of investors’ worst habits and trying to cash in on those. Another one is YieldMax, AI option-income strategy. So, it looks like it might be AI thematic ETF, but that’s actually a stock with the ticker AI. So, it’s a single-stock ETF, and then they sell a covered call against it. Why investors would need to buy this and for this particular stock that has only a $3 billion market cap is beyond me. I think it’s just taking advantage of the fact that its ticker is AI, to be honest.

1. Check to see if your portfolio needs rebalancing.

While periodically buying and selling holdings to bring your portfolio’s asset allocation in line with your target levels doesn’t usually enhance returns, rebalancing is a critical step for keeping a portfolio’s risk level in check. As market segments move in and out of favor, some areas of your portfolio might drift far above your original targets, while other areas might end up too low. If it’s been a few years since you rebalanced your portfolio, you’ll probably find that you’re overweight on domestic stocks (which have outperformed in eight of the past 10 calendar years, including the year to date in 2023) and light on international stocks. Similarly, as growth stocks returned to the fore in 2023, your portfolio might be overweight on growth stocks and light on value.

2. Consider adding to your portfolio’s bond allocation.

Bond investors have had a rough couple of years. The bond market suffered its worst calendar-year performance ever in 2022, when a series of aggressive interest-rate hikes led to a 13% drop in the Morningstar US Core Bond Index. Bonds fared better in 2023 but still suffered losses during the second and third quarters of the year.

But after this series of events, bonds have much better prospects for future performance. That’s because bonds are now offering significantly better yields than they did a couple of years ago. The 10-year Treasury bond offered a nominal yield of 3.9% as of Dec. 26, 2023. That’s down slightly from earlier this year but still higher than yields that prevailed during most of the period following the global financial crisis. The starting yield on bonds is a strong indication of future returns, so higher bond yields suggest that future returns should be better than those in the recent past. Bond yields are not only attractive in historical terms but also relative to stocks. While earnings yields on stocks exceeded those on the 10-year Treasury bond yield from 2009 through 2022, the spread between stocks and bonds is now much smaller.

There are some caveats, though. Even though the prospects for future bond returns look decent, bonds aren’t likely to keep pace with stocks over longer periods. If you’re looking to save up for a long-term goal such as retirement, you’ll want to make sure your portfolio also includes a healthy dose of stocks.

3. Make sure you’re getting a competitive yield on your cash holdings.

During the long period of near-zero interest rates, there wasn’t much need to shop around for interest rates on cash and other short-term holdings. Yields were low no matter what. But now that yields on the three-month Treasury bill are hovering around 5.4% (as of Dec. 26, 2023), it pays to make sure you’re getting a competitive interest rate. Traditional brick-and-mortar banks offer some of the worst payouts, with annual percentage yields averaging about 0.5% as of Dec. 18, 2023. It’s not difficult to find significantly better yields on high-yield savings accounts; money market funds; certificates of deposit; or Treasury bills, purchased via Treasury Direct.

If you don’t need immediate liquidity from your cash holdings, consider building a ladder of CDs or Treasury bills to lock in higher rates over a slightly longer period.

4. But don’t overdo it on cash.

As mentioned in the previous section, cash yields have been unusually generous lately. Yields on the three-month Treasury bill have been as high as 5.5% so far in 2023—their highest level since December 2000. That’s not only decent in absolute terms but also well ahead of inflation, which has been running at about 3.1% year over year based on the most recent data reported on Dec. 12, 2023. The attractive yield on cash has led to a flood of cash in money market funds, totaling more than $1 trillion for the 12-month period through Nov. 30, 2023.

But as I wrote in a recent article, loading up on cash can be too much of a good thing. It makes sense for most investors to hold some liquid reserves to cover emergencies and short-term spending needs. Retirees may want to hold a bigger chunk of cash to cover planned portfolio withdrawals for at least two to three years. For other investors, however, cash isn’t the best way to build long-term wealth.

5. Don’t get too complacent about inflation.

After a series of encouraging inflation reports, the market has been heartened to see evidence that inflation is finally under control. The current consensus forecast is for inflation to ease to about 2.4% by the end of 2024.

That would undoubtedly be a great outcome, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, even 2.4% is still higher than the Fed’s long-term target of 2.0%. And even moderate inflation represents a significant loss of value over time: A 2.0% annual inflation translates into nearly a 22% loss of purchasing power over 10 years. Second, the market’s current inflation outlook could prove overly optimistic. Unemployment remains well below longer-term averages, while huge amounts of pandemic-driven spending have led to record budget deficits.

Most investors will therefore probably want to maintain some level of inflation protection, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, I Bonds, or a small stake in commodities.

6. Consider adding some exposure to small-cap stocks.

Bigger has been better for most of the past decade. While smaller-cap stocks pulled ahead in 2022, mega-cap stocks—especially the “Magnificent Seven” (Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, and Tesla TSLA) stocks that have dominated the market—have outperformed in eight of the past 10 calendar years. For the year to date through Dec. 21, 2023, for example, the Morningstar US Large Cap Index posted a gain of about 29%—about 9 percentage points higher than Morningstar’s small-cap benchmark.

As a result, valuations on small-cap stocks are now looking significantly more attractive. While large-cap stocks look fairly valued overall, the average small-cap stock was trading at a 19% discount to fair value based on Morningstar’s analyst estimates as of Dec. 13, 2023. Granted, smaller companies tend to be less profitable and have weaker balance sheets than bigger, more-established companies. As a result, they could fall behind if the U.S. economy weakens. Still, long-term investors may want to consider adding a modest stake in smaller-cap issues, partly as a counterweight to the large, growth-oriented tech stocks that now dominate most broad market indexes.

Susan Dziubinski: Hello, and welcome to Morningstar’s third-quarter 2023 U.S. stock market outlook. My name is Susan Dziubinski, and I’m an investment specialist with Morningstar.com. The U.S. stock market continued its upward march in the second quarter of 2023, thanks to stronger than expected economic growth, declining inflation, and investor exuberance around a handful of growth stocks. What should be on investors’ radars heading into the third quarter? Here today to share their outlooks for the market and the economy are Dave Sekera, senior U.S. market strategist for Morningstar Research Services, and Preston Caldwell, senior U.S. economist with Morningstar Research Services.

Time to Batten the Hatches? Or Raise the Sail?

Dave Sekera: Thank you very much, Susan, and welcome everybody to our market outlook. Good afternoon. I’m going to start off the webinar talking about our market valuation. First, I just want to address the title of this quarter’s overview: “Time to Batten the Hatches? Or Raise the Sail?” At this point, we’re up well over 20% from October lows. And I’ve been hearing more and more market commentators talking about how this is the beginning of a new bull market and that investors should be jumping into equities in order to be able to ride the tailwind for new market highs. But then I’ve also heard other market commentators, too, talking that this is really just a bull trap and a longer term of bear market, and that the market is overvalued, and actually now they should be selling equities while the getting is good.

Market Rally and Undervalued Stocks

I think both of these really missed the point, and during this conversation, I really want to highlight for investors what we think they should be doing today based on our valuations of our equity research analyst team. I think now is really a good time with the market rally to look for those instances where we think the market has risen too far, too fast and become overvalued, where you can take profits and then reallocate those profits into those areas of the market which have been left behind and remain undervalued today. With that, let’s just start off with our broad market overview and then breaking that down by the Morningstar Style Box.

Based on those over 700 stocks that are covered by our equity research team, we do see that the market is still trading at a discount, still trading at about a 5% discount to a composite of those fair value estimates, even after the market rally that we’ve had thus far this year. Now, of course, that rally really has been mostly driven by the growth sector. And at this point, growth is really getting to be pretty close to fairly valued at this point after being the most undervalued category at the beginning of the year. And so at the beginning of the year, while we advocated for a barbell-shaped portfolio, being overweight value, overweight growth, underweight core, following that rally in growth, with it now being pretty close to fair value, I think now is a good time to be taking profit in that growth category but still remain overweight in the value category. At this point, I think really some of the best positioning for investors will be to overweight value and be underweight both the core category as well as the growth category.

Valuations by Market Capitalization

And then taking a look at valuations by market capitalization, you know the large-cap category because of the large-cap growth stocks rallying so much, that’s trading a little bit less of a discount than the broad market. So again, another area that I think you can probably start to take some profits, start to underweight those large-cap categories and put that money back into work into the mid-cap and the small-cap categories where we see much better relative value and a lot of undervalued opportunities.

Thinking through what’s going on, the economy has certainly remained much more resilient than I think a lot of people had necessarily thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year. But looking forward, as Preston will talk about in his economic outlook section, we do think that the rate of growth will begin to start slowing sequentially and it will end up slowing in the third and fourth quarter before bottoming out in the first quarter of 2024.

Moving on here, how does this compare on a relative basis, throughout history? We are still undervalued, but I would just note that we are at much less of a margin of safety than we were even a few months ago. Now thinking about the market action over the second quarter, for the most part I’d say I think the bank failures are behind us. Looking at the stocks, especially the U.S. regional banks, I think a lot of those stocks, looks like from our market technician point of view have bottomed out and are probably treading water and we think that they’re undervalued at this point. While we do think that there’s still some volatility there over the next couple of quarters, we do see a lot of undervalued opportunities.

Economic Outlook 2023

As mentioned, the expected economic growth has been much stronger than expected, but really in the second quarter, I think a lot of the market gains that we really saw were investor sentiment regarding artificial intelligence and the long-term potential there. And that’s really what drove this unusual rally that’s been concentrated in what’s been called the Magnificent Seven. Seven stocks are responsible for about three quarters of the market gain through June 26.

Now thinking forward in the second half of the year, I do think that the markets might get tested, and as we see that weakening or that slowing rate of economic growth over the next couple of quarters and that does pressure earnings growth with less of a margin of safety, we could see some pullbacks here and there. But I just don’t think that any of those pullbacks will be anywhere what we’ve seen in 2022. At this point for the rally to continue, I do think it’s going to need to spread out to the broader market. More specifically, it’s going to have to spread out into the value category, and then it’s also going to have to spread out into the mid-cap and the small-cap stocks as well.

Midyear Market Recap

Just a quick review of how we got here year to date. So through June 26, the U.S. Market Index, which is Morningstar’s broadest measure of the stock market, was up 13.2%. But, as you can see, predominantly driven by growth over 23% return year-to-date through the 26th. Now looking at some of the other categories, the growth category up 5.8%. To me, that’s actually a pretty solid return. I think in a normalized year people would be pretty happy with almost 6% for half of a year. And then the value category, which has certainly lagged far behind, only up just shy of 2% for the year. Looking at it by capitalization, the large-cap stocks, being the big winners, up 16%, and then mid-cap and small-cap stocks up 5.2% and 6.6%, respectively.

Taking a look at the evolution of our price to fair value from the end of this year to this year, you can see at the beginning of the year, we did think the stock market was pretty significantly undervalued, trading at a 16% discount to our fair value, now moving to only 5% discount. And growth stocks, being the big winners, they were the most undervalued at the beginning of the year, trading at a price/fair value of 0.77, now only at a couple percent discount. Whereas the value stocks, with the lag that we’ve seen there, still trading pretty close to where they were on a price/fair value basis at the beginning of the year. And then also looking at the evolution of the large-cap stocks, how they’ve moved much closer to fair value, whereas the small- and mid-cap still remain at pretty large discounts.

Taking a look at returns by sector: I think I would just note here what we’ve seen is that the sectors that were, in our view, the most undervalued by our calculations coming into the year are the ones that have seen the greatest returns thus far this year. The communications sector, which was the most undervalued coming into the year, up almost 32% through June 26. Consumer cyclicals, which were the second-most undervalued, up 25%, and technology, which was the third-most undervalued at the beginning of the year, now up 37%.

And it's those sectors that we thought were either overvalued or at least fully valued at the beginning of the year that have struggled the most. The energy sector down over 8% through the 26th, that was the sector we highlighted at the beginning of the year as being the most overvalued, and then utilities and healthcare, two other sectors that were slightly overvalued, the fully valued at the beginning of the year, selling off as well. And then lastly the financial-services sector, which certainly had a tough time earlier this year following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, and a couple of other banks. But it does appear that it’s bottomed out, and we do think that there’s good opportunities for investors in that area going forward.

Taking a quick look at the Magnificent Seven here, and again, these are the seven stocks that really have contributed about three quarters of the total market return this year. You can see with the Morningstar US Market Index how large of a weight these individual stocks have. They are all large- and mega-cap stocks. So of course they will skew the market. Movement based on just the size of them but also just looking at the year-to-date returns on these and just how much they’ve really outperformed the market. And several of these from Nvidia to Microsoft to Meta—stocks that I think really got caught up with a lot of the enthusiasm regarding artificial intelligence. The only thing is I would caution investors at this point: We really think that this has probably already run its course at this point in time.

When we look at these stocks, at the current valuation levels versus where they were at the beginning of the year, I’d note six of those seven stocks were either 4-star or 5-star-rated stocks. So again, stocks that we thought were pretty significantly undervalued at the beginning of the year, at this point, only Alphabet still remains undervalued. Several of these other stocks are all now trading within that 3-star category, meaning we think that they’re trading pretty close to fair value. And two of them, Apple and Nvidia, are now actually trading in 2-star territory. So again, we think that these stock prices have run up too far, too fast at this point in time. And those would actually be two stocks that I would highlight that I think now is probably a pretty good opportunity to take some profit in those names and be able to use that in order to invest in other areas of the market.

Stock Market Outlook

Thinking through what is going to impact the market in the second half of this year and going into next year, some of the macroeconomics, we do watch what the Federal Reserve is doing. So they have paused. Certainly looks like they’re going to hike again here at the July meeting. Now, the inflation rate is still running hotter than the Fed would necessarily prefer, but we do think that inflation is moderating. I think the real question here is: What is the Fed going to be doing after the July meeting? Is that going to be the final interest-rate hike of the year, and is that going to be the final interest-rate hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle? And following that, then the next question is: When is the Fed going to begin loosening monetary policy? Both of those questions, Preston will be able to answer in his economic outlook.

Inflation

As far as inflation goes, it is a different story now. It has continued to keep moderating, maybe not necessarily as fast as the Fed would prefer, but we do project it will remain on a downward path in the second half of this year and noting a lot of the major components that had driven that inflation higher are continuing to recede. And we do have a nice long-term outlook of inflation, getting back to the Fed’s target and staying there over the next couple of years.

Economic Growth

And then lastly, just getting back to the rate of economic growth. We do expect that growth will end up slowing sequentially over the course of the second half of the year before bottoming out in the first quarter of next year and then having a nice tailwind there thereafter. So with the market trading much closer to our fair value, there is a much smaller margin of safety at this point. I do suspect that we could see some selloffs in the second half of the year, really as the market is looking at a slowdown in earnings growth as well. But I do think that if we did have a selloff, it’s going to be relatively shallow. It’s not going to be anywhere near the magnitude of the decline in 2022.

For those of you that might have been part of our webinar at the beginning of 2022, we had noted that there were four main headwinds at the beginning of 2022 that the market was going to have to deal with. I think we’re in a very different situation today than we were back then. At that point we had noted that we thought the markets were overvalued. We noted that the Fed was going to have to tighten monetary policy at that point, inflation was running hot, interest rates were expected to rise. A lot of those headwinds are now either at this point having abated or even starting to turn into tailwinds in our view.

Sector Valuations and Top Picks

Let’s change topics here and start moving into some of our sector valuations and top picks. With the market being as concentrated as it is, we haven’t seen that much of a shift in our star ratings. So the percent of 4- and 5-star rated stocks did decrease slightly down to 45% from 52%. But maybe not as large of a decrease as I would have expected. You know, when we see the market up 13% in just two quarters. And the number of 1- and 2-star stocks did rise up to 15% from 11%. But again, still showing that there aren’t necessarily that many stocks we think are overvalued at this point.

Looking at some of the individual sectors, I’d highlight real estate, one of those sectors that really had been hit hard this year, does have the highest percentage of undervalued stocks. Then close behind that are the basic materials and communication sectors. And then it’s the consumer defensive and industrials that we think are the most unattractive, having the highest percentage of stocks under our coverage that are overvalued at either 1- or 2-star ratings.

Overvalued Tech Sector

Taking a look specifically at where we are on a price/fair value basis by the individual sectors, following a 37% surge year-to-date, technology is now the most overvalued, trading at about a 7% or more premium to those fair valuations. Again, this is the first time we’ve seen technology now in that overvalued territory since the beginning of 2022. I do think now is a good time to start moving to an underweight in that sector and start selling some of those stocks that have run up too fast. To the undervalued side, I would say looking at communications, again that was the most undervalued coming into the year. But with that being up 32%, it’s actually still the most undervalued sector, trading at about a 20% discount to fair value.

Real Estate is Undervalued

The real estate, now the second-most undervalued. Now within real estate, I’m still very skeptical of valuations for the urban office space, but away from that, we do see a lot of value there for investors. I think it’s one of those things where that office space valuations has really brought down the entire sector. And so I think with that, it provides the opportunities for investors to look at more idiosyncratic situations among some of the REITs that we cover.

Financial Services Are Volatile and Undervalued

Financial services, especially the regional banks, a lot of undervalued opportunities there, although I would say maybe a little bit more volatility. We’ll see where those results come out for the second quarter, just how much more deposit loss maybe we’d see in some of those regional banks. But I know from our equity analyst team that they would note that while we do think that the regional banks are under stress, we don’t think the business model is broken. Again, another area for investors to look for undervalued opportunities today.

Energy Is Becoming Attractive

Lastly, I would note that the energy sector is now becoming more attractive, not necessarily that far undervalued compared to the broad market, but again that was the most overvalued sector coming into the year, and so now we do see some more opportunities for investors there. Then lastly, the defensive sectors, those are the ones that held their value the best in 2022. Those came into this year being pretty fully valued, or at least fairly valued, and are still in that same kind of category, although we’re seeing maybe a little bit more individual opportunities here and there.

Running through some of our best picks from our analyst team, I would note that in the basic materials area, we’ve got three new best picks here. I would note that Albemarle takes the place of Lithium Americas. Again, we’re still very constructive on the lithium sector over the long term. Two new ideas to take a look at Corteva and Dow. And then also for those that are interested in gold, I’d note that we did pick up coverage of a number of different gold miners over the course of the quarter as well. And I know Barrick Gold is going to be our pick there for the gold miners.

And then the other one I would highlight on this page is going to be Federal Realty Investment Trust. So again, we do have a positive view on foot traffic coming back into the retail space. And that would be one name that I would highlight in addition to the Class A malls like Simon Property that we’ve talked about a number of times in the past. Among the economically sensitive sectors, we have a couple of new opportunities here in the communication services group, Verizon Communications being one of those: very undervalued, high dividend-paying stock, lot of margin of safety there. AT&T, its competitor, also would be one that I would highlight as well, but also an interesting name here is going to be Pinterest.

So taking a look at Pinterest and looking at what’s been going on in the digital advertising space, we’ve seen Alphabet move up quite substantially thus far this year. Meta has more than doubled, and so I think investors might be looking for other opportunities in that digital advertising space. Pinterest is one—it’s covered by the same equity analyst as Alphabet and Meta—that I think is worth a look for investors today.

Couple of new opportunities in the energy sector. Again, while the majors still look as though they’re probably pretty close to fair value. I know among the large majors, Exxon is still our pick there. I think it trades at about a 9% or 10% discount to fair value, but really the best evaluations we see are still among the services companies. In this case, Schlumberger is our pick in that sector.

Taking a look at industrials: Three new picks here as well, Dover, Jacobs, Stericycle. Stericycle, I think, is interesting. I think that’s one of those companies with the narrow economic moat, on the smaller side, maybe not all that well-known, but a company that I think pretty rarely trades at much of a discount to our fair value. So I think that one’s worth a look. And then Jacobs Engineering, again, I think that one’s got pretty good tailwinds behind it. Just thinking about some of the actions that have been put in place over the past year or two regarding infrastructure, thinking about the infrastructure spending in the Inflation Reduction Act. I think a lot of the engineering and construction companies are going to have a good tailwind for the next couple of years. And then lastly, a couple of new picks. Cognizant and Teradyne in the technology sector.

And then just wrapping up here with the defensive picks, I’d note among the consumer defensive ConAgra, I believe is a new pick here. Now again, it’s a no-moat-rated company, typically try and stay away from the no-moat and really focus on wide and narrow moat, but again, trading at about a 26% discount to fair value. I think that’s enough margin of safety to take a look at that name. And then lastly, the other one I’d highlight here is going to be Zimmer Biomet. So again, this is a returning name to the list, but I do think there’s going to be good tailwinds behind the medical-device makers.

Specifically UnitedHealthcare, one of the large insurance companies for healthcare insurance, did note relatively recently, and their stock actually sold off on the news, that they had been seeing a pickup in demand for healthcare services. I believe that indicates that a lot of delayed healthcare services, including things like joint replacements, that had been put off during the pandemic are now starting to come to fruition, so I think Zimmer Biomet and another one, Medtronic, would be two names that I think investors should take a look at.

Valuation by Economic Moat

Then let’s just wrap things up here and take a look at valuation by economic moat. I’d note wide-moat stocks have had a very good year thus far this year. Through June 26, the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index has risen just slightly over 20%, well outpacing the broader market. However, and unfortunately, that now leaves us at a much lower discount to fair value than what we had seen at the beginning of the year or even at the beginning of the quarter. So this really now shows that those no-moat-rated stocks are the ones that are trading at the greatest discounts to fair value.

Again, everything has a price, and valuation is always really the utmost importance when investing. But I would caution investors just to make sure that you do pick and choose carefully among those no-moat-rated stocks when you’re looking to invest.

And I’m not going to run through all of these, but again, just showing how you can use some of the Morningstar screening tools in order to help identify undervalued opportunities that might be right for your portfolios based on your risk tolerance. In this case, looking at those undervalued large-cap stocks with wide economic moats and Low or Medium uncertainty levels and then just rank order from the most undervalued on up. A similar screen here for mid-cap stocks. And then lastly, doing the same screen for small-cap stocks. Now in this case because with the small caps we don’t see as many companies with a wide economic moat, I also did incorporate those companies with a narrow economic moat. But again, I think a lot of interesting opportunities here, especially in that small-cap space.

With that, I’d like to turn things over to you, Preston.

Preston Caldwell: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. So just to provide a little bit of context: In 2021, we saw one of the fastest recoveries in U.S. economic history. Now it was inevitable that things were going to cool off a bit heading into 2022, and indeed, we especially saw the impact of supply-side constraints. And so the strong demand that was propelling growth in 2021 ran into the brick wall of supply constraints, and the result was a jump in inflation, with inflation in 2022 hitting its highest level in over 40 years. And in turn, the Federal Reserve responded with the largest interest-rate hike in terms of the federal-funds rate in 40 years.

An Economic Slowdown

Nonetheless, the economy has slowed by far less than most would have thought in the face of those interest-rate hikes so far in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 after that rate-hike campaign ramped up. However, I would say that most of the effects of Fed rate hikes have yet to fully play out in terms of the real economy. Therefore, we continue to expect growth to decelerate over the next 12 months in terms of the annual growth rate growth troughing in 2024, at 1.1%; after that, though, we expect Fed rate cuts to lead to a rebound in growth, with robust growth rates over 2025 to 2027, as you can see.

And those Fed rate cuts will be enabled by falling inflation. For this year as a whole, we expect inflation to dip below 4% and ending the year slightly below 3% in year-over-year terms. And then for full-year 2024 through 2027, you can see we expect inflation actually slightly below the Fed’s 2% target. With the fall in inflation driven most of all by easing supply constraints and also the impact of Fed rate hikes on cooling off demand.

Comparing our views to consensus: On GDP, we’re bullish compared to consensus forecasts. If you look at the longer-term forecasts that are out there, we expect actually a cumulative 5% more real GDP growth through 2027. This is driven partly by the labor supply side, where we expect greater labor force participation, and also on the productivity side, where I think consensus has overreacted to near-term productivity headwinds in the data, which I think more reflects noise and continuing temporary pandemic disruption than anything else.

Inflation Is Expected to Come Down

On the inflation front, consensus is expecting inflation to come down, but we’re even more optimistic, and you can see in 2024, we’re expecting, again, inflation below the Fed’s 2% target consensus. It’s at 2.6% for the full year, and the Fed, if you look at what’s baked into their latest projections, it’s about a 3% inflation rate for full-year 2024, so because we’re more optimistic than the market and especially the Fed on inflation coming down, we think the Fed will start cutting earlier and much quicker than is incorporated in Fed projections, as I’ll detail.

Interest Rates Forecast

Turning to our interest-rate forecasts: You can see we expect the federal-funds rate to ultimately dip from just over 5% currently to below 2% by 2026. In turn, we expect the 10-year Treasury yield to fall at least 100 basis points. Our long-term projection is 2.75% for the 10-year Treasury yield, and this will help enable a fall in the 30-year mortgage rate from 6.5% to 7% that it’s been averaging recently to below 4.5% by 2026 and 2027. And we think a large fall in the mortgage rate will be required to sustain a continued housing recovery, even though it does—some of the data has perhaps shown green shoots in recent months, I would say that’s probably ephemeral. You know, with housing affordability being as weak as it is right now, in terms of the median mortgage payment to household income, that having abruptly reached its worse level in well over 15 years. Unless we get a much greater fall in mortgage rates and much more affordable mortgage payments, we’re not going to see a sustained housing recovery, and housing is the most interest-rate-sensitive major sector of the U.S. economy, so that’s really key to look at in terms of how much monetary policy has to ease going forward.

Strong Activity Data

Looking at the near-term activity data, all of the hard activity data has been strong, with the partial exception of industrial production. Consumption has been volatile, but generally has continued to trend up. Employment has been the strongest indicator. And in fact, employment growth is really anomalously high right now. Employment was up 2.9% year-over-year in the first quarter, which actually exceeds GDP growth, up 1.8% year-over-year. And ordinarily it’s the reverse, right? You have GDP growth in excess of employment growth with the differential between those two basically being productivity growth. And so that means that businesses right now are hiring faster than they are expanding production of goods and services, and that can’t last forever lest it eventually cut into businesses’ profits. So businesses are going to dial back hiring, I expect, over the next six to 12 months so that they keep costs under control. And that will cool off the labor market substantially.

Now the one data point that does show continued weakness is the soft data in terms of, for example, the S&P Manufacturing PMI continues to show contraction in manufacturing activity on the horizon. However, I think that soft data, I’ve always been skeptical about it because it’s kind of a squishy survey that doesn’t really give you a firm indication on what’s going on in the economy. And I think especially it’s been disrupted by the pandemic because, for example, one of the main components of that index, the manufacturing PMI, is product backlogs, and we are seeing product backlogs fall substantially, but that’s mainly reflecting a normalization of supply chains rather than an imminent recession. I think those who have been making these recession calls based off of what’s going on in the PMI, I don’t think that’s appropriate.

GDP Forecast

Looking at the bottom chart, this shows our quarterly GDP forecast, and again, we expect growth to decelerate over the next several quarters. Troughing precisely sometime around the beginning of 2024 and then starting to accelerate toward the back half of 2024 as the Fed begins cutting interest rates and the market reacts to that.

Consumption Has Remained Solid

On consumption, real consumption has continued to remain fairly solid at 2.2% annualized rate of growth in the last three months. There’s been some volatility, which due to the holiday season being a bit unusual this year, consumers pull back on their spending in November and December. But then made up for that with higher spending in January and February, and all that volatility has made it a bit hard to infer the overall trend, but overall consumption has remained fairly stable. But what we see looking at the bottom chart is that households still have a very low savings rate compared to prepandemic levels: about over 400 basis points lower than their prepandemic savings rate. And that is not likely to last forever. What it appears is happening is that households are spending down that stockpile of excess savings that were accumulated during the pandemic. As you can see on the bottom chart, the savings rate in 2020 and 2021 was quite high; however, those excess savings are running out, likely within the next six months or so, and that will induce households to start to increase their savings rate to prepandemic rates in our view and that will slow consumption in the overall economy over the next six to 12 months.

Fed-Funds Rate Hike

Looking at our views on the fed-funds rate in more detail, looking at the top chart: We do expect one more rate hike in July. It looks like, looking at the latest Fed minutes, the committee is fairly set on that, and the data probably is not going to change their viewpoint dramatically over the next couple of weeks. However, we do think that this will be the last rate hike. And the first rate cut we expect to come in February of 2024. By then, I think the inflation data will have continued to have fallen enough and the economic activity data will also be weak enough that both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate will point toward the initiation of rate cuts, and we expect those to continue aggressively through mid-2025, ultimately with the fed-funds rate coming down about 200 basis points below what the market as well as what the Fed is projecting.

The counterpoint to this view is the idea that interest rates will be higher for longer. In other words, the regime of lower interest rates that we were in the prepandemic years will disappear and we’ll return to maybe the higher real interest-rate regime of the 1990s and especially the 1980s, but I don’t think that’s correct. I think there’s been structural factors in the economy like aging demographics, which mean that there is persistent downward pressure on interest rates, and we will see a return to the lower interest-rate regime prevailing prior to the pandemic. What we’re seeing right now is just a temporary cyclical upswing in rates.

Recession Risk and Commercial Real Estate

Thinking about drivers of recession risk, one of the main areas of vulnerability in the economy is commercial real estate, is high exposure in the banking sector, and much of the debt in this sector is variable rate or has a short maturity, and so there’s a lot more exposure to rising rates in terms of balance sheets. However, I don’t think there’s much reason to worry about a large bust in the commercial real estate sector. If we look at the top chart, total spending on nonresidential structures, that’s CRE and the national accounts basically, that spending, it wasn’t elevated in the prepandemic years and it’s even been down somewhat since the start of the pandemic, so share of GDP.

That’s a stark contrast with what we saw in the mid-2000s with the housing boom. You can see that was an exaggerated, highly exaggerated cycle in residential construction. We don’t have an excess of nonresidential building stock, which is going to create this large overhang on the economy. But admittedly one area that does look particularly vulnerable is offices, given the continuance of work from home. But offices only accounted for 13% of nonresidential construction in 2019, using prepandemic rates, or that’s just 0.4% of total U.S. GDP. So, offices are a very small slice of the U.S. economy.

Banking Sector Concerns

Looking at the broader banking sector, we have seen, after the precipitous outflows from the banks in March following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, deposit outflows have ceased in the last four weeks or so. So there’s a lot less concern, I think, around a banking crisis for now. I think there’s still a risk out in the background as long as rates remain as high as they are, which, and also I would note that there’s still a huge differential between the kind of deposit rates being offered by banks and money market yields, which are of course tied to T-bill rates and the fed-funds rate. And so there is the ongoing risk of weakness in banking, but what I will say is that even with deposit outflows having ceased, and even if everything remains stable, we still will see a headwind from the banking sector on the real economy because banks have been planning for a while to cut back on credit issuance in order to match the outflow in deposits that’s already occurred. And in fact, we saw a tightening of credit standards even in the fourth quarter of last year and also the first quarter of this year, even before the spate of bank failures that occurred, as you can see on the bottom chart. And so that tightening of credit standards will lead eventually to a contraction in credit growth, which will slow on the economy especially nonresidential investment.

CPI Inflation Rate Has Fallen

Turning to inflation in more detail: The CPI headline inflation rate has fallen dramatically from a peak of 8.9% in the middle of last year to 4.1% as of this last month. That’s been driven most of all by energy. And also now food to a lesser extent, but if we strip out food and energy to get core inflation, and we look at the sequential rate of progress, which is shown in the bottom chart, the yellow line, it has been a bit disappointing in the lack of further downward movement, being sticky around 5% so far in 2023.

Now what’s happened is that the rate of inflation in shelter or housing basically has started to come down dramatically. That was the main driver of core CPI earlier in 2023, but at the same time we’ve seen a rebound in all other components of core CPI ex-shelter. And that’s been driven most of all by durable goods, in particular used-car prices, which have rebounded. But if we look at the leading edge data on wholesale prices for used cars, those point toward a renewal of used-car price declines in the next several months, which should bring down the durable goods component of the CPI quite dramatically. We do see further deflationary pressure around the corner coming from that. In addition to ongoing declines in shelter inflation—most of the data in housing is still pointing toward reduction in rent growth compared to what’s prevailed over the last year or so.

Inflation Forecast

Looking at our inflation forecasts broken out into key components: You can see the main driver of why we expect inflation to come under control over the next several years is that not only do we expect the inflation that we saw previously in food and energy and durable goods to cease, we expect it to reverse, to run in the other direction. We expect the spike in prices which occurred to unwind, for prices to converge somewhat back to their prepandemic trend in these industries, and therefore deliver a bout of deflation in food and energy and durable goods over the next several years. And that is already starting to play out to a great extent.

Housing Inflation Is Expected to Normalize

Housing inflation we also expect to normalize, and then the rest of the economy, the main driver there will be what happens in labor markets, and I’ll talk more about that. Specifically for durable goods and also nondurable goods to lesser extent, the fact that we’ve seen supply chain pressures abating is a great sign and also for durable goods, specifically, semiconductor manufacturing capex has surged, and that is going to lead to a glut in semiconductors over the next few years, which will lift that major supply constraint, which is weighed on durable goods production.

New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index

Interestingly, we’ve seen the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which is one of the best comprehensive indicators of what’s going on in supply chains that there is, we’ve seen that index show that supply chains have not only returned to prepandemic levels but indeed have become looser than at any time since the inception of the index in 1997. And so this captures product backlogs and delivery times and shipping costs. It’s a wide set of indicators that show that supply chains are in very good shape right now.

Wage Growth Has Slowed

Looking at the bottom chart: This shows the picture for wage growth. There’s actually a lot of different measures that are out there, and they each have their pros and cons. We track a composite of four main measures, and that shows that wage growth has slowed from a peak of 6% year over year in early 2022 to 5% year over year in the first-quarter 2023, and that’s been without a large normalization of the labor market, yet. I mean, hiring has pulled back, but it still has much further to go in our view. And so as employers start to normalize their hiring further over the next year, that will provide continued downward pressure on wage growth.

With that, I’m going to kick it back over to my colleague, Dave Sekera, to wrap up the presentation.

Mega-Cap Stocks Have Surged

Sekera: All right. Well, thank you very much, Preston. And of course, we can’t talk about the stock market without talking about what’s going on with the mega-cap stocks. I mean, just if nothing else because they do skew the market action and valuation. Taking a look here, what we’ve seen over the past quarter and actually year-to-date, the mega-cap stocks have surged higher, and at this point, I think a lot of them have probably run their course. So, taking a look at those that were rated 4 and 5 stars at the end of 2022: Pretty much all of them other than, I think, two have significantly outperformed the market. Of those, Bank of America, being in that financial-services sector, is the only one that is down thus far this year because of what we’ve seen going on in the banking sector.

And Berkshire Hathaway has lagged the market but, again, at an 8.2% return. I really don’t think that’s necessarily all that bad. But again, not too many of these are rated 4 stars anymore: only Alphabet, Berkshire, and Bank of America. The rest of these 3 stars and a couple of them also now moving into that 2-star territory.

At this point, six stocks that were on the list at the beginning of the year have dropped off, only three remain, no new additions this past quarter. But what we’re now seeing is going to be a pickup in the number of overvalued mega-cap stocks. So these are the ones that were rated 1 or 2 stars at the beginning of the year. We can see quite a few of these have substantially underperformed the market. You know most of them having actually negative price returned thus far this year. Couple of them having fallen enough that they’ve actually now moved into the 3-star category from the 2-star category. But it still leaves us with a pretty good list here of overvalued mega-caps. The list has now grown to 10 from only four last quarter. So it does have a couple of additions on here being Apple, Broadcom, Oracle, Home Depot, Merck, Coke, and Pepsi.

Fixed-Income Market Outlook

Let’s just wrap things up with a quick fixed-income market outlook. Bonds have had an OK year thus far this year, although I’d say those returns really had been skewed to what we saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter, probably most of them a little bit above, breakeven, although not that much. A couple of pullbacks here and there, but again, thinking about, what we expect going forward and thinking about some of the forecasts, from Preston from his economic point of view. We do think that while there is one more hike in the federal-funds rate, that we do expect that that’s going to be the last hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle. We would expect short-term rates in 2024 to start coming down.

While you can still hide in the short part of the curve and get pretty decent yield here in the short term, that’s going to run its course probably later this year and beginning of next year once the Fed and the market starts pricing in the federal-funds rate coming down. I know in the longer end of the curve, we do think that interest rates here, and I think the 10 year has recently gone slightly above 4% again, we think that those rates are probably either at their peak a little bit above 4% or at least probably going to be pretty close to being at their peak. So I do think now is a good time to start moving out on the curve, being able to start lengthening your duration, into longer-duration securities from that shorter end or middle of the curve that we had been advocating for before.

And then for those investors who are willing to take a little bit of added risk on, I do think that both the investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads, I think they’re reasonable. I don’t think that they’re necessarily undervalued. I don’t think that they’re overvalued at this point. But thinking through our outlook for the economy, while we do expect the rate of economic growth to slow, we’re not expecting a recession. In fact, we’re not even expecting any individual quarter with a contraction. I expect that the number of downgrades and the number of defaults in the corporate bond market will remain relatively low. And so I think that you are getting paid appropriately for the amount of credit risk that you’re taking in both of those markets today. You know, both of them offering pretty good yields for investors.

Morningstar US Corporate Bond Index

And then lastly, for those people that have an interest in the longer-term charts of what corporate credit spreads have looked like, this is the Morningstar US Corporate Bond Index, and again, that’s our proxy for the investment-grade index. So yes, the current spread is below that long-term average, although I’d note that long-term average certainly gets skewed higher by what’s happened with the global financial crisis in 2008, 2009, the Greek debt crisis in 2011, and then most recently, the pandemic. So I think if you were to strip out some of those exogenous activities that had happened, I do think that we’re still at pretty reasonable level in the investment-grade market and then similar for the high-yield market there as well.

With that, here are our disclosures. I’m going to make our compliance team happy, and I’ll leave this up here for a little bit for people to peruse. And while the disclosures are showing, I’d like to go ahead and pass things back to Susan. And Susan, if you wouldn’t mind going ahead and starting to compile some of those questions, and Preston and I’ll be happy to take what the audience has.

Growth Stocks vs. Value Stocks

Dziubinski: Thank you, Preston and Dave. We’ll move on to the Q&A portion of our webcast today. Let’s get right to some of these questions. Dave, this one’s probably for you. If economic activity isn’t cooling off as the Fed and the market expected, what might happen when it comes to growth stocks versus value stocks?

Sekera: I think the biggest concern there is what the Fed is going to do if that doesn’t happen. And so at this point, I know, our base case is we’re looking for one more rate hike and then that’s going to be the end of this monetary policy tightening cycle. However, if the economy does stay stronger, stays hotter for longer, I do think that that could concern the market, that we could see additional rate hikes from here, and of course, depending on how much those rate hikes go up and how long that they would stay at those elevated levels. I think the big concern would be: Would that potentially cause a recession? And depending on how high and for how long those rates are going to be up there, it could be a relatively deep or prolonged recession, so in that case I would actually think that would put a lot of pressure on the overall market. Now, having said that, I would expect value stocks to hold up better. So again thinking through our valuations, there’s a much better cushion there: value stocks trading at a 15% to 16% discount from our fair values where the growth stocks are much closer to fair value. And also I’d also be very concerned about a lot of those growth stocks that really have ramped up this past year, those especially that we think have run too far, too fast, you could certainly see some big pullbacks in that case.

“Big Seven” Concerns

Dziubinski: Let’s talk about that a little bit more, Dave. We’ve gotten some questions about how concerned should we be with the “Big Seven”? Are there reasons to be worried when so much of the markets return has been concentrated in so few stocks?

Sekera: I don’t think it’s necessarily whether or not we should be concerned. I think it’s more a matter of the valuation and what that means for investors going forward. If you were to go back to that slide where we show our valuations on those seven stocks, it’s more matter of: I expect returns in the second half of the year to probably be a lot more muted than what we saw in the first half of the year. There’s two parts to that. One: just the broad market was significantly undervalued coming into the year. We’re only at a 5% discount now compared to 16% at the end of last year. And then also with those seven stocks, it really had been the market driver until now. They’ve kind of run their course; from a valuation perspective, we just don’t necessarily see a lot more upside there. And in fact, we could see, some pullbacks: Nvidia and Apple being the two that, from a valuation point of view, I would be most concerned about seeing those sell off potentially in the second half of the year.

Morningstar’s Fair Value Estimates

Dziubinski: Now we’re getting several questions coming in about Morningstar’s fair value estimates. How we calculate them, does P/E have anything to do with it? And what do we mean by “margin of safety”? Dave, can you do a quick run through on that?

Sekera: Sure. So, margin of safety, I don’t know, I think maybe it was coined by Graham and Dodd, two famous professors that wrote the security valuation handbook decades ago, I’m not even sure when it was published. So I think they probably coined the term “margin of safety” and I think it’s been more popularized by Warren Buffett. But again, it’s just talking about how much of a discount you think a stock is currently trading in the marketplace versus its intrinsic valuation. And when we talk about “intrinsic valuation,” we do the full academic valuation methodology for each company we cover, we do have a discounted cash flow model. And when you think about what is the value of a stock, yes, there are a lot of different shorthand metrics or ratios that people might use to try and gauge valuation like a P/E ratio. But again that, to me, doesn’t necessarily tell investors much about intrinsic value. So again, the value of a stock is the present value of all of the future free cash flows that company is going to earn over its lifetime, discounted to today based on its weighted average cost of capital. And so then coming up with that is our intrinsic valuation and based on how much of a discount it may be trading in the marketplace compared to that present value is then that margin of safety.

Why Were Recession Predictions Wrong?

Dziubinski: Preston, a couple of questions for you. Just to reiterate: Is Morningstar’s position that there will not actually be a recession? And then as a follow up on that, what made predictions of a market recession wrong?

Caldwell: I think right now there’s about a 30% probability of a recession over the next 12 months. I think that one thing I’ve talked about is the binary question of will there or won’t there be a recession is not very important. It gets way too much airtime in the media because we’re already headed for a period of, I think, below-trend growth. I think 1.1% for 2024. So whether the final growth number is 1.1% or whether it’s 0% with a couple of quarters in negative territory that then is deemed a recession, that’s not a big of a difference between those two scenarios. It’s not night and day necessarily when you are in a recession. I think what is important is: What is the risk of a severe recession? And I think that continues to remain very low with the vulnerabilities in the economy not being anything on par with, say, the 2000s heading into the Great Recession. That kind of scenario is not in the cards, I think.

And OK, so why did many people who were forecasting, let’s say, a 75% probability of recession, which many were about a year ago, why did they get that wrong? I would say one thing is, again, they may not be wrong. We may still get a recession. I still think the probability is about 30%. It could just be that the (lags) with which monetary policy impacted the real economy at much longer than we would have anticipated. And so, I mean, we haven’t really had a purely Fed-driven recession anyway since the early 1980s. If you think about all the other ones, I mean the Fed has played a role but hasn’t been the main driver. So, we don’t have a lot of great data in terms of exactly how to estimate the timeline for when monetary policy impacts the economy.

So, there’s plenty of reason to think that it’s just going to be a lagged effect. As I mentioned, you know, the banking sector still has a ways to contracting their credit growth, and that’s going to weigh on the economy over the next year in terms of bank-loan growth slowing. Now, what I will say also is that we’ve also seen financial conditions remain fairly resilient in the capital markets. For example, the yield curve has inverted, with the 10-year Treasury yield about 100 basis points below the federal-funds rate and that’s actually stimulatory for the economy. I know a lot of people think about an inverted yield curve as being a bad thing, but the fact that the 10-year Treasury yield is at 4% right now and it’s not at 6% above the Fed-funds rate, that stimulates more credit growth than would be occurring otherwise. So that’s helped to cushion the impact of higher federal-funds rates.

And also obviously the stock market as we’ve been talking about today has done quite well over the last year after hitting a trough in 2022. That’s helped to keep consumer spirits up and help the economy to avoid a recession. We also finally, sorry, we haven’t really seen much knock-on impact from the direct impact of Fed-rate hikes. You know, Fed-rate hikes have curtailed housing activity, but for example, the homebuilders haven’t really cut back their employment at all. Employment in housing-related industries has remained resilient, and so even as the rate hikes have affected some industries, those industries haven’t really passed on the effects to other parts of the economy, although that will probably change somewhat over the next year.

Should You Invest in Wide-Moat Stocks?

Dziubinski: Dave, let’s talk a little bit about, Preston mentioned that it’s low probability of an actual recession, but there will be an economic slowdown. Viewers asking, in light of that, if we do expect a slowdown in growth, wouldn’t wide-moat stocks be the place to be? But they look, like you said, a little closer to fairly valued today than say no-moat or narrow-moat stocks, but would wide-moat stocks still be the better play here?

Sekera: Well, like anything else, that always comes down to valuation. In this case, if we do have, some market selloffs, typically I expect those high-quality stocks probably sell off less to the downside than those companies, like a no-moat rated stock that doesn’t have long-term competitive advantages. So yes, from the perspective of for a similar company, for a similar valuation, or trading at a similar price/fair value, I would expect that the wide-moat stock or narrow-moat stock would probably sell off less than what I would expect a no-moat stock. But from a broader perspective for our entire coverage level, because the no-moat category is trading at such a large discount, I do think that that gives you much more of a cushion to the downside. So again, it’s always really going to depend on how you’re looking at it from an individual company or individual sector level as compared to a category level.

International Interest Rates

Dziubinski: Could lowering interest rates, which we said Morningstar expects the Fed to begin to do sometime in 2024, could lowering interest rates make the investment money move out of U.S. markets and go abroad somewhere with better interest rates?

Caldwell: No, I don’t think so. Because, I mean, compared to a lot of economies, the interest rate that you will receive in the U.S. is still going to be fairly attractive compared to where it was at before the pandemic, for example. If you look at, let’s say, the U.S. compared to many emerging markets, that’s the case. Now there is a chance for nominal interest rates to be higher in Europe than the U.S. for a period of time if their inflation problem lingers longer. However, as an investor, really, what you care about are real interest-rate differentials because if inflation is higher in the eurozone, you would also expect the euro to depreciate. And so I wouldn’t expect investor capital to chase after that yield differential. Really, I don’t think the U.S. is looking at worse real interest rates compared to other developed economies, which continue to be afflicted by aging demographics and lower productivity growth. Some of the factors that have been secular drivers of weak real interest rates in the long run.

Utility Stocks Valuation

Dziubinski: OK. Last question this morning or this afternoon is regarding sectors. Dave, a viewer wants to know what our take is when it comes to valuation of utility stocks right now. And then what are your best stock sectors in terms of valuation? I know you covered that in the presentation, but maybe you could just reinforce that.

Sekera: The viewer can always go back and watch the replay here and go back to the page that shows all the individual sector valuations, but the one that is still the most undervalued is going to be the communications sector. So a lot of opportunity there. You know, Alphabet still being undervalued again, that has a huge skew because of the size of its market cap. Meta, at this point, we think is fairly valued now that the stock has doubled thus far this year. But again, I do like a lot of those traditional telecom and media names. You know those that trade at very large discounts and have big dividend yields, I think, are attractive for the second half of the year. And then a lot of the cyclical sectors, we think, are still going to be the best areas. So again thinking through there, we do have the financial-services sector and the real estate sector, although I do think in the real estate sector, you do need to be a little bit choosy and I’d probably still steer away from any of those REITs that focus on the urban office space.

Dziubinski: Thank you, Dave and Preston. And thank you, everyone, for joining Morningstar’s third-quarter 2023 U.S. stock market outlook webinar. And have a great day.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Amy Arnott: And I’m Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist for Morningstar.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is Greg McBride. Greg is chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, where he has worked for more than 25 years. He received his bachelor’s in finance from the University of Florida. He is also a CFA charterholder.

Greg, welcome to The Long View.

Greg McBride: It’s great to be here. Thanks so much for having me.

Benz: Well, we’re really happy to have you here too. We want to start by discussing Bankrate generally and the role you play as its chief financial analyst. What’s a typical day like for you?

McBride: I guess the good news is there really isn’t a typical. There’s a lot of variety, which is what makes it interesting and makes it fun. But now it’s everything from crunching numbers on data that we’ve gathered or polling that has been done on our behalf, to responding to media inquiries or just seeing what’s going on with the latest economic releases. For example, whether it’s inflation reports, or the jobs report, or a speech by one of the Fed governors. That can not only be impactful to markets, but it can also generate media inquiries. So those are the types of things that we keep up to date on every day.

Arnott: Can you tell us a little bit more about the key areas that are within Bankrate’s purview? Is it mainly bank products for savers and borrowers?

McBride: Namely, yes. As the name implies, Bankrate, that’s really how the company got its start—serving bank products across the spectrum, everything from the savings side over to mortgages, loans, and credit cards. Our website does go beyond that. So, we do have other sections of the site that are geared toward things like getting insurance. For example, if you go to through our mortgage channel, you can also go and get home insurance through that channel. You can get auto insurance through our auto channel. When you’re looking at auto loan rates, the next step there is you can research auto insurance options. So, we are expanding beyond that. But the real base core, if you will, has been bank financial products. But we’re increasingly trying to cover sideline-to-sideline personal finance.

Benz: We want to delve into the current outlook for interest rates, the Fed’s actions. It’s been a little bit vexing, I think, for a lot of people in your shoes. A lot of economists were expecting to see a weakening in the US economy, at least eventually, due to rising interest rates. We had that inverted yield curve, which has been a harbinger of recession in the past. But that hasn’t materialized. And in fact, we’ve had a couple of recent inflation reports that were hotter than expected. So maybe you can talk about that—how you’re thinking about the state of the economy today and the direction of interest rates in the future.

McBride: The economy has continued to surprise to the upside, both in terms of growth as well as employment. Last year, coming into 2023, it was pretty widespread, almost universal, the consensus that we were going to have a recession before the end of the year. It didn’t happen. In fact, the economy grew faster in 2023 than it did in 2022. And as we come into 2024, I think expectation is that things will slow, we’ll see slower growth, slower growth in the economy, slower growth in employment. But that mythical soft landing is more within reach than we would have expected or dreamed of 12 months ago. So, I think the odds of that soft landing, where the economy continues to grow but inflation gets down to 2%, the odds of that have improved every day. The odds of recession, I think, have really faded into the background. I think it’s too early for a victory lap. I wouldn’t say we’re completely out of the woods, but the odds, I think, are certainly in favor of the soft landing. We did a recent poll of economists and only about one in three expects a recession within the next 12 to 18 months, which is about half of what it was this time a year ago when two in three were saying so.

Arnott: Would you say that this has been an especially difficult period to read from an economic standpoint relative to other points in your career?

McBride: I don’t know. That’s a good question. Because there have been, I think, a number of different times where it’s been challenging. We’ve certainly seen things come out of left field. The economy was slowing in late 2019. The Fed was cutting rates, but nobody saw Covid coming and economic growth just completely falling off the cliff and then come roaring back. I think there’s been a lot of unique circumstances over the years that make it difficult. This is certainly one of them, but it by no means has a monopoly.

Benz: What’s your take on the inflation front? Would you say that the Fed can declare victory?

McBride: I think it’s a little early for that. I think things have certainly improved, but inflation is pretty stubborn at this point. It is not going to be a smooth ride down to 2%. It’s not necessarily going to come quickly. I do an annual interest-rate forecast at the beginning of every year. That’s something I start working on usually second half of December. At the time, I said that I expected inflation was going to be pretty stubborn and that the Fed was only going to end up cutting rates twice in 2024. At the time, widespread expectations in the markets were that the Fed was going to cut rates six times or even seven. That always struck me as fantasyland. Even the Fed at the time was saying three. The Fed is still saying three, but now those market expectations have really swung wildly to the point where it’s three or two, or sometimes you hear even some voices saying none this year, and that’s because of those inflation numbers that have been stubborn. We had a nice tailwind in the latter part of 2023 when gas prices were coming down. We don’t have that tailwind. So, as a result, we’ve seen the progress halted, and more recently, we’ve seen the oil prices start to work their way up. I think it’s going to take a couple of months to really see is that something that filters through even into core goods prices, and does that set back some of the progress that we had seen last year on inflation?

Arnott: With that kind of stubborn inflation and some uptick in energy prices, when do you think we will actually see the first rate cuts, and are you still expecting to see about two rate cuts in 2024?

McBride: I think we’re still on track for two. It’s probably not going to start as soon as investors might like. Initially, it was May, and now it was June, but I think even some of those June forecasts are starting to get pushed back. I think a lot will depend on what we get from the CPI reading, for example, next week. If that’s another bad number, those June expectations are going to go right out the window. So, it’s probably going to skew toward the second half of the year, but I still think we’re on track for two, but that’s contingent upon seeing some improvement in inflation, albeit uneven, but continued progress on that front, even if it comes slowly.

Benz: I wanted to ask about the strength of the consumer. It seems like consumer spending has been really quite strong despite high inflation, but as interest rates were going up in 2022 and 2023, there was widespread concern that consumers would start to pull back. I’m wondering if that has materialized when you look at the data. Are there any areas where you’re seeing that, yeah, consumer spending is softening a little bit?

McBride: What we see is really a K-shaped economy where the top 25% of households are doing fine. They’re continuing to spend, and that’s where a lot of discretionary spending is coming from. The top quarter of households contribute about 40% or so percent of the spending in the economy, sometimes a little bit more. On the other hand, 60% of households are living paycheck to paycheck, and that’s where inflation has really done a number, not only on their finances and their ability to make ends meet. You’ve seen savings balances go down, credit card balances going up, but also in confidence. So, there’s really two different things going on right there, and it’s one of those where it’s, if you look at the aggregate numbers, it’s looking at something from 35,000 feet, oh, it looks nice. Then when you’re on the ground, you’re like, ooh, not so nice.

I think it’s kind of the same thing in that if we look at the aggregate numbers, and yes, the consumers continue to spend and everything looks positive, but when you look into the data, you see that for a lot of those households, the spending is happening because stuff costs more, not because everything is super wonderful. We’re seeing credit card balances going up, nobody is financing purchases at 20% interest because everything is wonderful. That’s a pretty clear sign of the financial strain that they’re feeling. So, yes, spending has been really strong, but for 60% of households, there’s not a lot of discretionary happening in that spending. It’s out of necessity and the bulk of the experiential travel and those type of things tends to come at the upper end of the income and wealth spectrum.

Arnott: Within that 60% of households, are there any subsegments of consumers that look especially vulnerable or troubled to you right now? Is it mainly people who have a lot of credit card debt or student loans, for example?

McBride: The credit card debt, I think, is certainly a real problem. I mentioned that we’ve got record-high credit card balances at a time when credit card rates are at a record high, but more people are carrying balances for a longer period of time, and it happens when unemployment has been below 4% for two years in a row. That’s not usually a mix that you see, and I think that’s in and of itself a warning flag. So, yes, paycheck-to-paycheck households, particularly low- and moderate-income households, they have really been feeling the strain, but it’s not exclusive to that segment. For example, there are some, even what we would call higher-income households, that they’ve gone a little overboard with the spending, and they too are in that position where the income may not be keeping up with their spending and their expenses, and as a result, it’s dented savings and resulted in more debt.

Benz: Following up on the student loan question, Greg, I think when loans were on hiatus, student loan payments were on hiatus, I think there was this expectation that when they came back online that that would begin to punish those consumers. What do you see when you look at the data there?

McBride: I’m not sure we’re seeing the full effect yet because I think in a lot of cases, the payments haven’t resumed in the sense that either the borrowers are maybe still not making the full payment; maybe they’re getting into a new income-based payment program; maybe they just haven’t started paying them back yet, knowing that it’s not something that’s going to show up on their credit report right away. So, I don’t know that we’ve seen the full effect there, but it’s a budget-buster for many of those who do have student loan debt. Budgets have been really, really tight the past couple of years just because of the escalation of day-to-day necessities. Then you throw in that, oh, by the way, that $300 a month or $500 a month student loan payment that you were making a few years ago, you’ve got to start making that again. That’s certainly a recipe for financial distress, and I don’t know that that’s one that we’ve really seen the full effects of at this point.

Arnott: On the positive side, you’ve tweeted a couple of times about interest rates went through this rapid rise—took the elevator up in 2022 and 2023, but there’s an expectation that they’ll go down at a slower rate, take the staircase down more gradually. So, it seems like that would be pretty positive for both savers and investors. Is that your take?

McBride: Certainly, for savers. We’ve seen some of the best returns we’ve seen in more than 15 years on safe haven products, and that’s everything from high-yield savings accounts and money market deposit accounts to money funds, Treasuries. And I think that even in an environment where interest rates are working their way a little bit lower, you’re still going to be outburning inflation on those risk-free or safe haven investments. And to string two years in a row together where you can say that, is pretty rare feat. So, I think from the cash investors’ standpoint, the outlook continues to be very positive, that idea that rates coming down but coming down slowly is actually a benefit. Where that’s a hindrance is back to a lot of those borrowers we were talking about a moment ago, where rates aren’t going to fall fast enough to bail you out. If you’ve got credit card debt, you need to focus on attacking that debt aggressively, taking advantage of 0% balance transfer offers to really put the wind at your back and really put the hammer down on paying down the debt because rates aren’t going to fall fast enough to really make a difference and bail you out. You’re going to have to do the heavy lifting on that.

Benz: We have a whole bunch of questions about savings products, which are like the breakout sexy product of 2023 and 2024. But before we get into that, I just wanted to ask about the election in November and to what extent do you think the November election will factor into the Fed’s decision-making around interest-rate cuts? And maybe you can talk about what history tells us about that.

McBride: There’s a tremendous difference of opinion. The Fed says that they do their best to be apolitical and the looming election doesn’t impact what they have to do to be what’s best for the economy. But on the other hand, I think just the awareness of it, that in and of itself can have a subliminal effect. There is a Fed meeting in September and then the next one is right after the election, literally the same week. So, if they get to September and it’s kind of on the fence about, well, do we cut rates or not, it’d be pretty easy to punt until the next meeting, which comes after the election, and then voila, they didn’t have any impact on the election. But by punting, does that have some effect on the economy, again, because they were trying to avoid any appearance of influencing the election or having an impact there? So, a lot of that is how people perceive that I think is going to depend on the lens through which they’re viewing it. But at the end of the day, I think the Fed is ultimately going to make decisions that are based on what they’re seeing in the economic data, and the timing of the calendar is going to be a pretty distant secondary consideration.

Arnott: As Christine mentioned, this has been a great environment for savers. You can get yields of about 5.5% on the shortest end of the yield curve as we’re taping this at the very beginning of April. But one of your colleagues, Karen Bennett, recently wrote that the majority of savers are still in accounts that are yielding less than 4%, even though it’s really not that hard to get a better yield. So, what do you think is going on there?

McBride: We did this consumer poll and we found that two thirds of savers are earning less than 4%, and that’s in an environment where, as you noted, the yields well above 5% are very attainable. And those 5%-plus yields are literally available to everyone. We got a plethora of accounts listed on Bankrate.com, but more than a dozen that are earning more than 5% APY, are federally insured, are available nationwide and have minimal deposits of no more than $100. Literally available to everyone. And so why are two thirds of savers not taking advantage of that?

I think inertia is—it can work for you or against you. And if you just stick in with the same old bank account, same old savings account that you’ve had, you have not benefited from the sharpest run up in interest rates in 40 years. On the other hand, if you’re out there actively seeking better returns and putting your money where it’s going to be welcomed with open arms and higher returns, then you’re in that book where you’re earning 4.5%, 5% or more. And so, the only thing that’s really keeping anybody from earning 5%-plus is the person they see in the mirror. So, it is literally within reach of everyone. Everybody needs that rainy day fund. The ability to outearn inflation on that risk-free savings account, it’s a pretty rare circumstance to take advantage of while you can.

Benz: Just to take a step back, Greg, can you talk about why there is such a huge range of interest rates on offer for these bank-offered products that are basically fungible? Why the huge variation in the return that you’re able to earn?

McBride: What banks pay, whether it’s savings accounts or certificates of deposit, is ultimately a reflection of their desire for deposits. Market share equals pricing power. The banks that have the biggest market share, they’ve also got the most deposits. They don’t need to pay up to keep the deposits they have worked on and certainly not to bring in more. And their yields reflect that. Despite the sharpest increase in interest rates in 40 years, a lot of the big banks are still paying 0.01 on savings accounts, and that’s because they’ve got pricing power. They’ve got market share. They don’t need to pay up.

On the other hand, there are banks out there that they don’t have the thousands of branches and ATMs all over the country. They don’t have billboards all over town. They don’t have their name on the stadium. They can’t outmarket their big behemoth competitors. How can they compete and how can they bring in the deposits that they need? Pay a higher rate of return. And as a saver, we can exploit that difference. We’re not hostage to the 0.01% that the big banks are paying. We can send our savings to a place where it’s going to earn a higher rate of return. We’re going to be able to preserve the buying power of that money. But we don’t have to change anything about our day-to-day banking. We can link that back to the checking account you have at your current bank or credit union.

Arnott: Would it be fair to say that when you’re looking at the old-line brick-and-mortar banks that they might be relatively quick to ratchet down interest rates on their savings products when rates go down, but slower to adjust them upward?

McBride: Yeah, I’d say that’s generally the case. The deposit costs, that’s a cost center. And so, banks, they depend on that interest margin, the difference between what they pay on deposits and what they earn on loans. And so, when interest rates go up, they’re pretty quick to reprice the loans. They reprice deposits as needed when rates fall. It’s going to take a while for that loan book to reprice. So, what do they have greater control over is what they’re paying on deposits. And so, yes, they do tend to move those down at a much quicker rate, which is how some of those banks ended up at 0.01% in the first place.

Benz: I wanted to ask another, I think, pretty basic question. But we’re in this situation where bonds are yielding less than savings products today. In my investment career, I don’t remember that there’s been as long a stretch where this has been the case. Can you explain why this happens and maybe also help us size up this period relative to history that you’ve observed?

McBride: You mentioned the inverted yield curve at the top of the segment. And that’s got a lot to do with it in the sense that because of the expectation that interest rates are going to come down—how much and when still to be determined—but the expectation is that interest rates are going to come down. The longer you go out of the yield curve, the less you’re earning. That’s certainly true with Treasuries, but it’s also true in terms of CDs and a lot of bonds, for example, particularly on the investment-grade side. So, the very short-term yields still reflect an environment where the fed-funds rate is as high as 5.5%. But the expectation that it’s not going to stay that way forever is why you find longer-term instruments that have yields that are below that.

So, yes, you can put your money in a savings account earning over 5%, but once the Fed starts cutting rates, it’s probably not going to be earning 5%. It’s going to come down too. If you want safety and stability in terms of what you’re going to earn on a rate of return and you’re willing to commit your money for a period of time, yes, you can lock into a bond or a CD and do that, but the yield is going to be lower to reflect the expectation that by the time that matures, interest rates are expected to be considerably lower than what they’re at today.

Arnott: If you are expecting that the Fed will be lowering rates and you don’t need the liquidity, do you think that locking in a five-year CD with a rate of 4.6% or 4.7% is a smart option today versus staying on the shorter end of the yield curve?

McBride: The key ingredient there is, as you said, you don’t need the liquidity. Time horizon really has to be the determining factor. You can’t put yourself in a position where you’re chasing yield, and particularly now, yield curve is a burden. So, if you go longer term, you’re taking a lower yield than you could get on a shorter term. You don’t want to have to then cash out early and then give some of that yield back in the form of an early withdrawal penalty. So, time horizon is really now the determining factor of what maturity you pick. But yes, if you don’t need the liquidity, if you have the luxury of locking up your money for five years, I think the five-year CDs are very compelling right now, whether you’re a retiree that’s looking to set up future interest income, you have a specific expense at a particular time in the future, or you’re just looking to diversify an otherwise equity-heavy portfolio.

Benz: Sticking with CDs for a moment, we wanted to ask about laddering CDs. We talk to a lot of retirees, and they say that that’s something that they like to do to help supply their cash flow needs for the years ahead. What do you think about laddering a portfolio of CDs today, even though the yields on shorter-term CDs are higher than the longer-term ones?

McBride: Well, laddering in and of itself is kind of an all-weather strategy. The idea there is you’re diversifying among a range of maturity dates. So laddering is not how you’re necessarily going to optimize your interest earnings and get the absolute peak in the cycle that avoid the absolute bottom. Instead, what it’s designed to do is really smooth out those peaks and valleys and give you a more predictable stream of interest income, which is really what retirees are after. So, I think now is an awesome time to be setting up that ladder. It just the reality of it is, as those instruments mature in the years ahead, you’re likely to be reinvesting at lower rates of return. But by virtue of the ladder, you’re only ever reinvesting a portion of your money at a given point in time, not the whole ball of wax. And so that diversifies your exposure to falling interest rates from that standpoint.

Arnott: If I’m shopping around CDs, whether I’m trying to set up a CD ladder or just buying one CD for a set time period, should I just look for the highest rate and call it a day? Or are there other factors to consider as I’m deciding what type of CD I want to purchase?

McBride: Certainly, I think a couple of other factors you want to take into consideration, especially where else you may have money. For example, if you already have $200,000 in CDs at a particular bank, well, you don’t want to go out and put another $100,000 in there and put yourself over the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. And so, you have to certainly consider that. We mentioned the time horizon, that being a factor. But also, it’s a very competitive landscape. And so, you’re not necessarily tied to just one particular bank. If you want to get a competitive return, there are plenty to choose from. So, you see the one at the top of the list. Maybe you already have a few other CDs with them, and you don’t want to put more money with them, you can go to the next on the list. Maybe it’s a bank that you had a previous experience with, and you’re like, and I think I’ll try somebody else. You have that option. It’s a competitive field. There are plenty of other banks that are offering competitive returns. So, yeah, I think you can take other factors into consideration, but not feel like you’re sacrificing a lot in order to do so.

Benz: In addition to information on different CDs and their interest rates, Bankrate also has information on savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, as well as money market accounts. Maybe you can help us with the terminology there. What’s the difference among those three account types?

McBride: Well, savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are, from a functionality perspective, kind of six of one, half a dozen of the other. They’re both designed to meet the same need, which is the need for immediate cash, not a transaction account that maybe you’re paying all your monthly bills out of, but you get an unexpected car repair bill or other unplanned expense, it’s the money that you tap into for that. A lot of the top-yielding accounts, you’ll see it’s a mix of savings accounts and money market deposit accounts. So, from a saver’s perspective, you’re really indifferent as to what nomenclature is attached. You want the Federal deposit insurance. You want to deal directly with the institution and know that your money is liquid. You can get to it when it’s needed and you’re earning a competitive rate of return.

CDs are a time deposit. So, they’re more akin to bonds, where you’re committing your money for a period of time, but you also know exactly what you’re going to earn for that period of time. And if you renege on your end of the deal, in other words, you cash out early, you’re going to pay an early withdrawal penalty. That’s typically the forfeiture of interest for some period of time. Now, the little-known fact about early withdrawal penalties a lot of people don’t realize is that if you cash out of a CD and you haven’t earned enough interest to satisfy that early withdrawal penalty, they can dig into the principal for the difference. So, now, the cost of misjudging your time horizon not only has erased your return, it’s also erased some of your principal. Well, the whole reason you put your money in a CD is to preserve the principal. So, it really comes back to that time horizon being the determining factor, whether or not you’re in the market for a CD and if so, which maturity is right for you.

Arnott: You mentioned the $250,000 limit for FDIC insurance and that being one of the reasons why you don’t want to have too many assets with one institution. There are also some firms now like Wealthfront, Betterment, and others who are offering much higher FDIC insurance limits, maybe up to $5 million or $8 million per depositor by working with a network of partner banks. Do you have any opinion on those types of programs or is there any risk under the surface with those programs?

McBride: A lot of banks in fairness offer those options too, and some of those have been around for decades, some of these programs that banks use, and that allows them to be able to accommodate that high-net-worth client who—they bring a lot of money in the door, they can for the purposes of Federal deposit insurance, farm that out to their network of banks. But the customer gets the convenience of dealing with their preferred financial institution—we’ll deal with one bank, not 30 different banks. But for purposes of Federal deposit insurance, that may be chopped up into little pieces and farmed out to all those banks just so they stay under the Federal deposit insurance limit at all those banks. So, yeah, I think as we all got a reminder of about a year ago at this time with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, among others, is there’s no sense having money in a bank that’s uninsured. You’re not being compensated for that risk. Federal deposit insurance is paid for by the banks, not by you. So, utilize it, make sure whenever money you’ve got on deposit with a bank, or a credit union is fully covered by Federal deposit insurance. And there are a lot of different ways to do that, many of which are involved still dealing with just one bank because they offer these programs that allow them to expand the amount of insurance coverage they offer to their clients.

Benz: In a related vein, money market mutual funds, of course, are not FDIC-insured. There’s no guarantee of principal stability there, and we saw that in stark display during the great financial crisis. But it seems like one workaround would be to just invest in a money market mutual fund that invests in Treasury bonds, where you have a really good likelihood of being made whole. So, what do you think about that idea as a workaround for people with, for whatever reason, a lot of cash assets who don’t want to monkey around with bank FDIC protections?

McBride: I think money funds are certainly a fine supplement to what you have. For example, the money that you’ve got in your brokerage account that you want to be able to put to work at a moment’s notice if the market has a bad day or a bad week, money fund is the place to have that money that’s instantly available at the point you want to invest. So, I don’t think this is necessarily all or nothing. Particularly for higher-net-worth clients, they like the idea of having some diversification in terms of where their different accounts are. Just that way, they don’t ever feel like they’re locked out of their money. And so, you may very realistically have a money fund or two with different brokerage accounts, but then also have a high-yield savings account that is for your emergency fund or money market deposit account that’s for a specific cash need that you have coming up in the next couple of months.

Arnott: We’ve been talking a lot about cash and different types of accounts that people can use to hold cash. And definitely, if you look at a 5%, 5.5% yield, that is pretty attractive. But do you think there could be a risk that some investors are overallocating to cash right now?

McBride: That’s a great question. Like I said, we’ve seen some of the best yields on cash that we’ve seen in more than 15 years. I think for most consumers, the problem is they don’t have enough cash. They’re anemically low on things like emergency savings. But for those that are higher-mass affluent, higher-net-worth households, yeah, I do think that there is a risk, particularly in times of market volatility. You look at 2022, both the bond market and stock market suffered losses that year and fairly steep ones. And at the time, interest rates were on the rise. So, I think there’s a lot of money that probably gravitated toward cash at that point in time that maybe hasn’t made its way back into those other asset classes, even though we’ve seen a nice rebound, particularly on the equity side with the market going on to set new record highs. So, yeah, I do think there’s a risk of having too much in safer haven investments. And as we’ve seen time and time again, the tendency to chase performance where just money came out of stocks and bonds when the prices were falling and went into cash, and the money is only going to come back out of cash and into stocks and bonds now that asset values are fully recovered, and you get to pay full price. That bad habit that investors have of chasing performance and in the process getting the timing all wrong.

Benz: We’ve been talking about how this has been such a boon to savers, but we also wanted to talk about borrowers, the other side of the ledger. It’s not been such a happy situation for people in the market for new mortgages, for example. There’s that old saying that you should date the rate and marry the house. And so, I’m wondering if you can talk about whether you think that’s good advice for homebuyers in a market like the current one, that should they just focus on finding a house that they like and can afford and assume that they’ll be able to refinance at some later date? How should they approach it?

McBride: I wouldn’t use the word assume, but I would say certainly prepare for the opportunity to refinance. So, yeah, I think by and large, that’s very apropos right now. And it’s why I’m not a fan of necessarily paying discount points in this environment to buy down your rate. You part with a lot of cash to buy down your rate just a little bit. And often, it will take you five or six years to earn that back. Well, there’s a fair chance rates will drop a little bit in the next five or six years to the point where you’d refinance. You take out a loan today at 7%. If rates fell to 6.25%, you’d be all over it to refinance.

So, I’m not a fan of paying the discount points right now because I don’t necessarily think you’re going to get the return on investment. Likelihood is much higher that you get enough of the drop-in rates to be able to refinance. And I think for a lot of homebuyers and homeowners that have taken out loans with rates of 7% or even 8% like we saw last fall, that if interest rates were to fall over a prolonged period of time, that you could find yourself as a serial refinancer, that you basically, refinancing every time rates drop 75 or 100 basis points, doing it again and again. And who knows if that will happen and how low rates will go. But I do think that you will see ample refinancing opportunities come about over the next few years that certainly warrant that. So, I would certainly say be prepared. I would assume don’t sacrifice affordability. Make sure this is a payment you can live with. If things don’t materialize, and rates don’t fall, you’re the one that’s on the hook for the payments. But if things play out as expected, we do think mortgage rates are going to fall and you want to be prepared to take advantage of that.

Arnott: With that widespread expectation that rates will fall eventually, are you seeing more people taking out adjustable-rate mortgages?

McBride: Not really. And there was, I think, a little tendency of the media to over-report this about a year ago, when the percentage of applicants that were applying for adjustable-rate mortgages reached a multiyear high of 9%, which, if my math is correct, that means that about 10 out of 11 borrowers was not taking adjustable-rate mortgage. But yet, somehow, the surge and popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages became newsworthy. So, I think a little bit was overstated—it had been 6%. It went up to 9%. But it was still really, really low. And even now, it’s still very, very low. The fixed-rate mortgage, and specifically the 30-year fixed, is the dominant product, and with good reason. It’s the best gauge of affordability. There are plenty of areas of life to take risk. Your house is not one of them.

Benz: I realize it’s kind of tangential to your work. But I wanted to ask about that National Association of Realtors settlement over agent commissions. There’s been a lot of discussion about the impact that that will have on buying and selling homes and the cost of buying and selling homes and the home market. Can you talk about that, especially the consumer implications?

McBride: I think the design or the ideas that over time, it’s going to reduce transaction costs, particularly for sellers. And that’s certainly a good thing. The US has some of the highest transaction costs for real estate of any place in the world. And somebody can sell $300,000 worth of stock for literally pennies. But you go to sell a $300,000 house and you get back 8% or 9% in terms of various transaction costs. So, yeah, something’s got to change there.

I’m curious to see how this unfolds. And I think it’s going to evolve over time. But I do worry if there might be the unintended consequence of buyers, particularly first-time buyers, find themselves perhaps a little orphaned in the environment in the sense that all the money is on the sales agent side. The more you gravitate to that side, all of a sudden, the first-time buyer who needs some guidance, maybe they don’t have as many people willing to take them around. Or you have buyers that they flat out can’t afford to pay out of pocket for the cost that it would take to retain a buyer’s agent. So, they either go it alone or maybe they go with the à la carte model. I think you’ll see more and more of that popping up as well, where I can drive myself around and look at houses, but what I really need is somebody who can look over the paperwork and those kinds of things, so paying a specific price for specific services that cover particular aspects of the process.

Arnott: Another decision that people are faced with when they’re buying a house is whether they should use a mortgage broker. Can you talk about the pros and cons of using one?

McBride: I’m just a big fan of casting a wide net. Not everybody charges the same price. You want to get the best deal for your money. And that means shopping around. And you certainly start with your own financial institution. But casting that wide net means doing a search, looking more broadly. That could be utilizing a mortgage broker. It could be using a site like Bankrate.com to compare among various mortgage lenders. The point being, cast a wide net and make sure that you can get the best deal that you can actually qualify for. Just go with the first one you see or the guy you know—you don’t have the context. Maybe you are getting a great deal. But unless you’ve been able to compare that to something else, you really don’t know if that’s the best deal you could get. So, I’m just a big fan of casting a wide net. Included in that net are mortgage brokers, traditional mortgage banks, credit unions. Casting that wide net is how you’re going to get the full scope of the marketplace.

Benz: I wanted to ask about auto loans. Those interest rates have shot up a lot. And the terms are also really long, like seven years, eight years. Can you talk about what people should know if they’re in the market for a car and they have to finance it?

McBride: This is one I think doesn’t get nearly enough attention. When you look at the strain that household budgets are feeling, oftentimes the reason for that is sitting in the driveway. Auto payments are budget busters. And particularly with the escalation of sticker prices and Americans’ preference for ever larger and more expensive vehicles, you’re seeing more and more amounts financed stretched over longer periods of time. And as you noted on top of that, interest rates have gone up pretty dramatically over the past couple of years. And so, you’re seeing an increasing number of borrowers who are taking payments at $700 or $800 a month for one vehicle. And many households have more than one vehicle. So, how much of that monthly budget is getting poured into car payments? It’s a depreciating asset.

So, yeah, not a great time for buyers. And if so, do what you can to minimize the amount you’re financing and the period of time you’re financing it over. The goal is to get yourself to a point where you’ve got life without car payments. Because then, instead of pouring $700 or $800 a month into payments, now that $700 or $800 a month can go into savings, building up a little bit of a nest egg that you can use to pay cash for the next vehicle, or at least make a big dent in the amount that you have to finance. Unfortunately, a lot of people are on the wrong side of that, where they’re rolling negative equity into each new purchase. And so, over time, the amount they’ve owed has grown larger and larger and larger. So, it’s not just the vehicle that’s getting larger and larger. Over time, it’s the amount that’s owed, it goes up every time they trade a vehicle in, roll over the negative equity to buy an even pricier vehicle.

Arnott: It’s interesting. We’ve talked to a couple of other people on the podcast who have pointed out that, especially for people who maybe grew up in poorer families and are just starting to make more money, that a really nice car is a very tangible sign of wealth and a way of maybe showing their friends, neighbors, even themselves that they’re doing well. And it seems like that is one of the reasons why a lot of people might tend to overspend on cars in particular.

McBride: Completely agree. Unfortunately, it is seen as a status symbol, but it will eventually be a rust bucket. On the other hand, homes tend to appreciate in value. So, if you’re looking for a status symbol, at least pick one that’s going to appreciate over time, not one that’s going to depreciate.

Benz: So, picking up on Amy’s question, you’ve been involved in credit counseling—providing credit counseling, I should say. Do you have any tips for people who have had issues with racking up credit card balances or other types of debt?

McBride: I think the first thing—and I’m glad you brought this up—the first thing really is just knowing that there is help out there. There are options out there. You’ve mentioned my involvement in nonprofit credit counseling, I served on different boards in that industry for about a dozen years. And I did so on a volunteer capacity because I saw firsthand the great work that they do for people. And so, if you’re having problems with debt, if your balances are going up rather than down, if you’re having trouble making the payments, you’re not in this alone. One of the steps you could take, particularly if you feel like you just can’t get a handle on this, is to work with a nonprofit credit counseling agency. They can really work with you to help with things like budgeting. They can even negotiate with your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates, put you on a repayment plan—the end goal to get you out of that debt altogether and get you on a pathway toward financial stability. So, knowing that those options are out there, the great work that they do for people, that’s the thing that I shout from the mountain tops.

Arnott: So, also on the nonprofit side, you’re a member of the board of the Rose Foundation’s Consumer Education Fund, and you’ve been an advocate for financial literacy. Why do you think financial literacy is still generally pretty poor?

McBride: It is still generally pretty poor. No doubt about that. We don’t teach it enough in schools. We don’t teach it early enough. There’s not necessarily enough positive role-modeling in the sense that a lot of the parents don’t have a handle on their finances. So, how could they possibly model good habits for their kids? So, the cycle then repeats itself.

I don’t know that there’s a one single magic bullet here, but certainly making it a higher priority in the education system and over an extended period of time, and then putting people in those positions to teach it that have experience in the field, that can impart those positive habits on the part of students. One of the things I did a number of years ago was I did some guest lecturing at Rutgers University, and they had a class that was in part dedicated to financial literacy, and it was always oversubscribed every semester. So, again, it just shows the demand is out there. People know that they don’t know enough, and they want to know more, and yet, I think collectively, at least from an education system standpoint, I think we kind of let them down.

Benz: Wondering, Greg, you’ve been doing this a long time. Can you talk about what you think is one of the most underrated or underdiscussed aspects of personal finance?

McBride: Successful saving is all about the habit. There’s really not a whole lot of magic to it. Particularly when you’re young and your earnings are low, the sooner you can get in the habit of saving 10% to 15% of your income, the better, because that habit will then stay with you for years to come. As your earnings grow, so too will your savings. What’s unlikely to happen, what’s not going to happen is you’re going to get to a certain age and all of a sudden, flip a switch and become a great saver. But yet, all the time, you hear people say, well, I’ll start saving as soon as I get the debt paid off. Well, I’ll start saving as soon as I get that next raise. Those milestones come and go, and guess what, the savings never really gets started.

So, I’m just a big fan of establishing that habit of saving right from the get-go, from that very first paycheck. And the sooner you can do that, the better, because it will stay with you for years to come, time being your greatest ally from the standpoint of building wealth. Every dollar you put away into a tax-advantaged retirement account when you’re in your 20s, could be $15 or $20 by the time you retire. And so, that power of compounding is, it’s really compelling. But you’ve got to get in the game to be able to participate.

Arnott: We’ve been hearing a lot about this new trend of so-called loud budgeting, where people are trying to be much more open about their finances. And maybe if they can’t go to an expensive restaurant with their friends, they’ll explain why that is and the fact that they’re trying to be more responsible with their finances. Do you think that that’s a positive thing?

McBride: If it works, I’m all for it. I think whatever works for people, there’s not necessarily a right or a wrong way to do it. You’ve just got to find what works for you. It’s comforting to see that just this peer pressure I think has led people down a path of overspending and keeping up with the Joneses and trying to keep up with appearances. It’s nice to see the pendulum swing the other way and create a safe place where, hey, being mindful of your dollars, cutting back, doing without, it’s OK. And in fact, in our group, it’s cool. So, I think in that respect, it’s a very positive development.

Benz: Well, Greg, we’ve loved hearing your insights today. Thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to be with us.

Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF
(VGSH)

Short-term Treasuries are among the safest assets available to investors. They carry virtually no credit risk and little interest-rate risk. They’ve also tended to do well when stocks haven’t. Additionally, the opportunity cost of investing in an ultra-safe asset like short-term Treasuries is not as steep now as it has been historically. This is because the yield curve has been fairly flat, meaning that investors have not been compensated for taking additional risk.

The Case for Short-Term Treasury ETFs Exhibit 1 below illustrates the safety of an investment in a short-term Treasury fund compared with the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500. Over the 15 years through August 2019, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Index, which includes original term U.S. Treasury bonds with between one and three years until maturity, generated the fewest number of negative monthly returns and had the shallowest drawdowns. Over this same stretch, the index's standard deviation was nearly 2 percentage points lower than the aggregate bond index and over 10 percentage points less than S&P 500.

Exhibit 2

Further analysis revealed that there were only three months in which the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Index lost more than half a percent. There were 32 such months for the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index and 52 for the S&P 500.

According to data provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis[1], the average annual rate of inflation during the 15 years through 2018 was approximately 2.10% (as measured by percentage changes in the Consumer Price Index). Although the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Index’s annualized 15-year return through August 2019 of 2.13% does not inspire caviar dreams, investors seeking capital protection would have been satisfied. Investors should bear in mind that while the principal protection is a near-given, the return on short-dated Treasuries will fluctuate with movements in interest rates. For example, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Index fell by 0.12% in September 2018 after the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points.

Like most of Morningstar’s top-ranked fixed-income exchange-traded funds, the highest-rated short-term Treasury ETFs are market-value-weighted. Market-value weighting a short-term Treasury portfolio reflects the market’s intuition about the value of each issue and tilts it toward the largest issues in the market, which tend to be easy to obtain and cheap to trade.

The Treasury market is efficient and liquid, reflecting the market’s inflation and interest-rate expectations, and Uncle Sam is the only issuer here. It is not reasonable to expect an active manager to generate higher returns without also introducing more risk to the portfolio. Indexing makes sense as a means of capturing this opportunity set because the return potential is limited, thus raising the relative importance of fees--which are lower for index trackers.

Short-Term Treasury ETFs for Consideration There are three Morningstar Medalists on the menu of short-term Treasury ETFs. Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF VGSH, Schwab Short-Term Treasury ETF SCHO, and iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF SHY all track market-value-weighted indexes of U.S. Treasury bonds with one to three years until maturity and sport low fees.

Vanguard Short-Term Treasury and Schwab Short-Term Treasury each receive Morningstar Analyst Ratings of Silver. Both funds track Bloomberg Barclays-sponsored indexes of U.S. Treasury bonds, which include issues with one to three years remaining to maturity and at least $300 million in outstanding face value. Both indexes are rebalanced on the last calendar day of each month.

iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond has a Bronze rating and tracks the ICE U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Bond Index. As with the others, qualifying bonds must have at least $300 million in outstanding face value. Each fund’s index is rebalanced monthly.

As expected, these three funds have very similar portfolios, as illustrated in Exhibit 3.

Expense ratios are extremely important in comparing short-term Treasury ETFs because return potential is limited in this narrow opportunity set. Exhibit 4 illustrates that the main distinguishing point between the Silver-rated funds and the Bronze-rated fund is the annual expense ratio.

Other Cash-Safe Alternatives Exchange-traded funds tracking short-term Treasury indexes are hardly the only option available to investors seeking safety. Other vehicles can act as a defensive component to a portfolio and protect against the eroding power of inflation. Some of these are deposit products, which have the added benefit of being FDIC-insured, thus carrying no potential for loss on amounts up to $250,000.

High-yield savings accounts are available through FDIC-insured banks. The rates offered on these accounts vary widely, as can the required minimum deposit, and they can change at the discretion of the bank. Although they are also variable by bank, an investor can easily find a high-yield savings account that does not charge a monthly fee. While the yields offered by some banks are quite paltry, a diligent investor can easily find an institution that offers a higher yield on a savings account. For example, the annual percentage yields currently (as of Sept. 16, 2019) offered by both Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Barclays are both 2% and neither requires a minimum deposit. Funds held in high-yield savings accounts are very liquid and can be easily withdrawn, although some institutions do carry a nominal penalty for accounts closed within 180 days.

A money market deposit account is very similar to a savings account (much more so than a money market mutual fund). It is a type of deposit account available through a bank and is insured by the FDIC. Much like high-yield savings accounts, the rates available to investors and the required minimal deposit to open an account vary widely by bank. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation[2], the national average rate earned on a savings account in the U.S. as of September 2019 was 0.30%. As is the case with high-yield savings accounts, investors who conduct their own due diligence will be rewarded, as there are many options offering higher yields. For example, the APY (as of Sept. 16, 2019) offered by BBVA was 2.40% with a minimum initial deposit of $10,000; CIBC Bank USA offered 2.20% APY without a minimum initial deposit amount. Although variable by bank, the typical money market deposit account offers check-writing ability while the typical high-yield savings account does not, an advantage for those investors who might need emergency access to their funds. For that reason, investors acutely worried about liquidity might prefer this option.

A money market mutual fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term and highly liquid securities. As it is a security and not a deposit account, this instrument is available through registered securities dealers and is not FDIC-insured. While the risk is small, these funds carry the potential for loss of principal. There are thousands of different money market mutual funds issued by many investment companies; fund size, return potential, and expenses vary across products. According to data from Morningstar Direct, the average 12-month yield and annual expense ratio for money market mutual funds were 1.67% and 0.47%, respectively, as of this writing. The key advantage of a money market mutual fund over a short-term Treasury ETF is its volatility. Over the trailing 15 years ended August 2019, the standard deviation of the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index was 1.25, while the category average for money market mutual funds was only 0.46. Money market mutual funds seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00, so this low level of volatility is to be expected. Additionally, their returns are less correlated to the S&P 500, a boon for investors seeking additional diversification.

Long-term investors understand business cycles and the need for a defensive component to their portfolio to protect against inflation and the potential for loss of principal. An investment in a market-value-weighted short-term Treasury ETF is a solid choice, and any of the three previously discussed would cheaply and efficiently capture this opportunity set, while seldom experiencing significant losses. But there are other options for investors. Those who want to guarantee principal for investments up to $250,000 could consider higher-yielding deposit accounts, like a savings account or a money market deposit account. The yields offered on these products are dependent upon the institutions offering them and always subject to change. Additionally, investors could opt for a money market mutual fund.

Create a New Financial Plan for the New Year, Part 1
Watch

Ivanna Hampton: Welcome to a special episode of Investing Insights. I’m your host, Ivanna Hampton. The start of a new year marks the time of likely wanting to improve your financial health. You may promise to spend less, save more, and manage your money better. Now old financial habits tend to make those New Year’s resolutions challenging to keep, but don’t give up. Morningstar Inc.’s director of financial psychology, Sarah Newcomb, has written about money management, and she says a change in mindset can help you develop a financial plan. Here’s part one of our conversation.

Hi Sarah.

Sarah Newcomb: Hi.

Hampton: So, financial advice tends to tell people to break down their budgets, needs versus wants. What are your thoughts on this concept?

Newcomb: Yes, I hate this concept. I know you know that. I mean, there’s nothing really wrong with the needs versus wants in one sense, but what it does is it actually runs counter to the way that our human motivation runs. So just to put some context on it: When we say this—you have to know the difference between a need and a want—it’s well meaning. What we’re trying to say is you need to prioritize your spending, right, and understand that some things are necessary, some things are not. The problem is that: Think about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. On that hierarchy, down at the bottom we’ve got our physical needs, then our physiological needs, and then our emotional and social and needs for meaning and purpose.

And the thing that the needs versus wants paradigm does is it basically says is if it’s not down at the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s a want. But if you actually go and read Maslow’s work, he was very clear that the hierarchy idea is not an order of importance. It’s an order of primacy. If you had no needs met at all, you would want those physical needs met first, but as soon as your needs are met to some extent, your higher-order needs become apparent to you. So it’s not Maslow’s hierarchy of wants. It’s Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. So I think of them as all five of these categories, all the way up to self-actualization and meaning, are things that humans need to feel like we’re thriving. And so if we budget from a needs versus wants paradigm, what we’re saying is I’m going to make a plan to feel deprived, emotionally, socially purpose wise. And no wonder we hate it. So I think we need to switch our thinking a little bit to make budgeting align more with the way that our psyches work so that we won’t be unconsciously fighting against it all the time.

Hampton: What should we include in our needs?

Newcomb: Well, everything on Maslow’s hierarchy is a need, so your social life is a need. Love and belonging is a need. Status is a need. We need respect from others. Meaning, spirituality—these things are needs. So the question then becomes, it’s just a simple shift of wording, but it represents a big shift in how you’re thinking about your priorities. I recommend thinking in terms of needs—which are all on Maslow’s hierarchy; you can find them all there—and strategies for meeting needs. Everybody has the same needs. Humans all over the world. They’re universal to all of us. We all have the same needs, but our strategies for getting our needs met—that’s where we can be creative and flexible. So you’re not learning the difference between a need and a want and just discounting and cutting out whole areas of spending that may be meeting very important deep needs for you, but you are finding ways to get all of your needs met within the constraints of your budget.

Hampton: You’ve written that our wants point to our needs. Can you explain that?

Newcomb: Let’s talk about wanting to go out with friends, right? I want to go out and have a drink and socialize with my friends. Well, what’s the need? Obviously the need isn’t a cocktail, you know? The need is that connection. And that sense of maybe fun or adventure, right? So when you pinpoint the need then you’re able to find another strategy that will meet the same need for less money. So, in that case you could say, well, my need is to socialize, so I don’t necessarily need to get the most expensive thing on the menu. I definitely don’t need to buy a round of drinks. Maybe I just get one drink and an extra cup of ice and do something where you’re spending less money but you’re still meeting your need. Or you’ll have people over. You find ways to be creative in keeping within the confines of your financial constraints, but you’re not constraining your ability to feel fulfilled.

Hampton: How do we take that example of buying drinks, maybe you get the less expensive drink, and apply it to a budget for running a household.

Newcomb: Some of the biggest things with running a household budget: Most of us that struggle with this are spenders, and I know this from personal experience, as someone who’s always been a spender. The spending that we do—a lot of times we’re trying to meet our emotional needs with spending. It takes some honesty and some self-reflection. The way that I do it is you look at your budget and rather than just crossing things off and saying well, I can’t afford that because I don’t need it to survive. You first asked yourself what are the needs that I’m meeting with this right now. For example, maybe you don’t care that much about going out to eat, but you have a restaurant budget. You have a line item in your restaurant budget, but it’s not that much of a priority for you. But on the other hand, maybe your need for self-expression, you get that met through fashion, through shopping for clothes. So you could then balance your budget in a way that you put more toward the things that really meet your needs and less toward the things that you don’t care so much about.

Or if you find that there are places where you really need to cut back, then you need to find strategies that simply don’t cost as much that also still meet the need. One big concept that I think is useful here is understanding that, in general, spenders are meeting needs for freedom, autonomy, self-expression, fun, enjoying life today. Savers, on the other hand, tend to be meeting needs for security, safety, and a sense of those security needs. And so you can understand why if you have a couple where one is a spender and one is a saver, they would clash. Because when you say “Don’t spend that money,” what you’re saying is “Don’t feel free. Don’t express yourself. Don’t enjoy your life.” Or when you say “You can’t save that money,” what you’re saying is, “I don’t care about your need to feel safe.” So you can understand why these things would create deep conflict. But once you understand that everybody’s got the need to feel safe as well as the need to express themselves, then you can start to say now how can we come up with solutions where we can meet the need to feel safe as well as the need for fun and entertainment or whatever else is getting met over here. And then you’re on the same team and you’re creative problem-solving together rather than just arguing over strategies.

Hampton: It seems like to start this off you need to ask yourself whether I’m a spender or a saver.

Newcomb: I think most people would know where they’re on on that spectrum, right? And if you are a spender, if you’re in a relationship where your significant other is the opposite, you probably know that. But I think that thinking in this way offers us a language to talk about, even when you’re talking to yourself about money, what needs are you really meeting with that spending? It’s the same thing when you’re talking with someone else: What needs are they trying to meet? And then you get to conversations that go a lot deeper and they get to the root of what’s really going on, so it is actually an opportunity to grow closer.

Hampton: If we take these strategies, but we find out like I love to spend, right? I have that urge to splurge. How can you use these strategies to fight that urge?

Newcomb: You will start to recognize—I mean, part of this, what Jung said was “until we make the unconscious conscious, it will rule our lives and we will call it fate.” And I love that because the process here is first self-reflection, and then you will start to notice, you’ll just notice what’s happening, and then you have a choice. Once you notice what’s happening, you have a choice how you respond. You may not change your behavior right away, but you’ll start to notice. How do I feel when I’m getting that urge to splurge? For me, it’s boredom or depression. Those are the two things that really drive that urge to splurge. So I have learned over time that when I’m thinking about going out just to shop, I will ask myself, What do I really need? What is going on? And usually a little bit of self-reflection and a walk out in the sunshine or hanging out with my dogs can keep me from spending, and it may seem very simple but it does take some practice. It takes some practice to recognize what your particular triggers are and then to catch yourself, and then once you catch yourself to start to have alternative things already in your mind, different strategies already in your mind. When you’re in the moment, that’s not the time to be thinking of new strategies. We’re not good at that. So in a time of reflection, you can come up with new ways the next time you feel that urge to splurge. What’s something you could do to meet the need? And then when you’re presented in the moment with the choice, you’ll have an alternate in mind already. It just gives you a leg up when you’re in the heat of the moment.

Hampton: What would you recommend for someone who’s new to this to put together for their moment of reflection?

Newcomb: A little note card is helpful. What I would say is: If you’re someone that struggles with spending, you are not alone, first of all, think about the last time you kicked yourself for spending money. The last time you regretted it and ask yourself, “OK, what were the needs that you were trying to meet? Because you were trying to meet a legitimate human need. And I think we kick ourselves and we add shame to the situation, which is not helpful. So rather than being ashamed of spending too much yet again, ask yourself what were the needs you were trying to meet? And then what were the needs that you threatened or didn’t meet through the strategy of buying the thing? And then just think in that situation, what is something you could have done instead that maybe would have met all of your needs better. And so by reflecting on a past situation we can set ourselves up for success in the future.

Hampton: Very good advice. So now we know the emotion. We have our note card. Are we ready for that urge when it comes?

Newcomb: Sometimes. I mean, it really depends. Behavior change is a long process, and I think it’s something that we have to be patient with ourselves about. Like I said, you will be more likely to notice what’s happening, psychologically, once you’ve done this self-reflection. And once you notice it, then you have the opportunity to make a different choice. It doesn’t mean that you will every time, but over time if you persevere, you will and it’s actually very empowering when you finally do.

Hampton: Thank you, thank you. I know there are people out there listening. They’re wondering, “OK, the next time I’m driving by my favorite big-box retailer, do I turn into the parking lot? Do I keep going?” So that’s good advice. Think about the note card.

That was part one of Create a New Financial Plan for the New Year. We’ll bring you Part 2 next week, where we’ll focus on how to avoid fighting about money.

Here’s how psychological factors shape financial management.

The Pursuit of Wealth and Well-Being

In theory, personal money management is simple: Spend less than you earn and invest the rest in a few well-diversified funds. Keep this up consistently for about 30 years, and you can spend the rest of your life living comfortably on the proceeds.

In practice, things aren’t so straightforward.

In this column, I hope to bring awareness to the myriad ways that psychology and emotion affect our financial decisions for good or ill. We’ll explore psychological factors that contribute to many aspects of financial management from goal setting to estate planning.

Here’s a preview of some of the topics we’ll navigate together.

Spend Less Than You Earn?

For many, earning enough to support regular savings requires an initial investment of several years and tens of thousands of dollars to increase their earning power. If this can be managed at all, it sets the timeline back considerably. Still, it’s often worth the detour, since without skilled labor, people are vulnerable to poverty traps and financial chaos, making long-term investment nothing more than a pipe dream.

Once people start earning, lifestyle creep (fed by expectations of family, friends, culture, and desire) creates new challenges. Some fall into debt traps that set them back years if not decades. Others may not understand the importance of investing early and thus wait too long to begin accumulating assets. Some become sandwiched between the needs of their children and the needs of financially vulnerable parents, leaving little for personal savings. All these things eat away at one’s ability to build wealth.

Investing Isn’t Simple, Because We’re Not

Those who manage to save and invest can still fall prey to all kinds of mistakes owing to unconscious biases, lack of knowledge, overconfidence, and faulty rules of thumb. And, with thousands of investment products to choose from, they may get stuck in analysis paralysis because of what Christine Benz aptly calls the ”financial complexity complex.”

Then, after decades of saving and investment, many of those who reach financial freedom find it difficult to enjoy the fruits of their labor. It can be hard to shift from the mindset of disciplined saving to one of comfort, plenty, and freedom to spend, and the resulting anxiety eats away at one’s quality of life.

End-of-Life and Generational Matters

Those fortunate few who manage to cultivate intergenerational wealth must then confront the challenges of family dynamics and clashes of culture in the process of family governance and estate planning.

Even if someone manages to avoid all these pitfalls, they will be faced with the reality of cognitive decline, deteriorating health, and a waning ability to manage their own affairs as they approach the end of life, limiting or even eliminating one’s sense of financial autonomy.

And this is if you make the journey alone! If you share finances with others, there is the potential for conflicting priorities and values, challenges in communication, and mismatched timelines at every step along the way.

Clearly, personal financial management involves much more than numeracy and financial acumen.

Introducing ‘Human Capital,’ a Column on Psychology and Emotion in Financial Decisions

Every major financial event is also a major psychological event, sometimes involving or affecting others. Career moves, marriage, divorce, parenting, education, home ownership, starting or selling a business, receiving an inheritance, and so on, all have deep emotional and psychological importance in our lives, making it extremely difficult—I would even argue inadvisable—to remove emotion from our mental calculus.

Add to this the fact that we are all human and have human limitations. Most of us will face some sort of psychological challenge to saving and investing. Short-term thinking, emotional spending, financial caretaking of able others, gambling, and financial avoidance are just a few of the ways that we can get in our own way. Yet, if we dare admit to these realities, we are often faced with shame rather than support or helpful advice. I aim to change that.

Who I’m Writing for and Why

If you are a purely logical decision-maker who has no difficulty saving, investing, and building wealth, I congratulate you. You do not need this column. But if you are not a perfect money manager, if you struggle to save or invest, if you need to curb your emotional spending or finally have that hard money talk with your spouse, you are in the right place.

Overspenders? I see you. Hoarders and penny-pinchers? I hear you. Worried wealthy? You are welcome here. Our goal is not to remove our humanity from the process of financial decision-making, but to explore and understand the nonmonetary aspects of these decisions so that we can make choices that truly support us in the pursuit of prosperity and well-being.

As we take this journey together, I hope to hear from you about topics that interest you. What aspects of financial decision-making do you want to learn more about? What areas of financial psychology can I explore for you? I welcome your suggestions and questions. I can be reached at sarah.newcomb@morningstar.com

Jeff Ptak: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Jeff Ptak chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Christine Benz: And I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.

Ptak: Our guest on the podcast today is Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at Morningstar. In her role she works to integrate the findings of her research into Morningstar financial management applications and tools. Before joining Morningstar in 2015, Sarah earned her doctorate in Behavioral Economics from the University of Maine, where her work focused on the psychological barriers to sound personal money management. She's the author of Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind. Sarah also holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Salem State University, a master's degree in Financial Economics from the University of Maine, and a master's certification in Personal Financial Planning from Bentley University.

Sarah, welcome to The Long View.

Sarah Newcomb: Thank you. It's great to be here.

Ptak: So maybe we'll start off with financial literacy, which I know is a key area of interest for you. You've noted that rules of thumb really work in financial education. What are some examples? And why are they so useful in your opinion?

Newcomb: I love rules of thumb. I think for the most part, we need to work with the way our brains work rather than against them. And we tend to take the complex and distill it down to the very simple, and so rules of thumb work with the way that our brains like to work.

One of my favorite examples of studies in the rules-of-thumb area was an experiment that was done with small business owners in, I believe it’s, Central America. And what they did was they split them into two groups, and one group was given a basic accounting course. And the second group was given just a bunch of rules of thumb for accounting. And then the next year, guess which group performed better on their accounting tasks? It was the rules of thumb group. And part of the reason is because rules of thumb are memorable, and they're general and flexible. And we can often take them into more than one circumstance. Where we learn exact equations, those equations only are fitting in very specific circumstances. And so, rules of thumb tend to be more general, more flexible, more memorable, and therefore they're more useful. So, I think that for most financial decisions, yes, there are some where exactitude is important, but most financial decisions can be solved with general rules of thumb as long as you're applying the right rule to the right circumstance.

Benz: What are some examples in personal finance where a rule of thumb might be useful?

Newcomb: I think some really simple ones are things that probably most people will be very familiar with: things like keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 30% so that you can get good interest rates and have your debt be manageable, and not overwhelming. Things like saving at least 10%. Putting general rules around the amounts that you're putting toward the past and the future, I think are really helpful. Things like, I mean, there's a typical ""100 minus your age"" for equity investment rule of thumb, which I think a lot of financial advisors balk at, but it's at least a starting point. It's at least a place to say, look, this is better than throwing a dart at the board. And lots of times what rules of thumb can do is get us started thinking about a problem and at least get us moving forward.

So, I think rules of thumb can be especially helpful in situations where there's a lot of information that's complex, and maybe not enough time to really digest all the information. Heuristics and rules of thumb are what our brains use to make good enough decisions, when we have constraints on our time, or the amount of information we have available to us or the amount of information we can process. And they're really applicable when you're in a situation where there's too much information or not enough time, or both. So especially when it comes to things like looking at comparing funds and comparing lots of complex attributes of different investment strategies to put into your portfolio.

A lot of times one of the things I love about Morningstar's work is our star ratings, our moat ratings, our globe ratings, our carbon leaf ratings--these are all rules of thumb. They take the very complex financial analysis and fundamental analysis of the company's balance sheet and business practices and distills them down to something that's digestible, memorable and useful. And so I think that those ratings are great rules of thumb to be able to say look in the absence of being able to understand every single bit of information and read all the prospectus on everything, you can say I'd like a fund that has five stars and a wide moat and five globes. And you're going to make a good enough decision in that situation. And we often focus on trying to make absolutely the optimal decision, when really what we need is to be able to make a good enough decision and be happy with that.

Ptak: That's a good segue to the next question we had, which is the financial-services industry and its tendency to try to optimize portfolios and financial decision-making, which is laudable in a way, but do you think it's gotten in the way of some of these rules of thumb taking hold? We're often surprised, for instance, about the amount of criticism that good quality target-date funds come in for among financial-services professionals, for example. So, do you think that the financial-services industry allows perfect to be the enemy of good, with good being some of those rules of thumb that you mentioned?

Newcomb: I really do. And I understand it as well. I'm a math person. I love numbers, I love the problem-solving, the puzzle aspect of trying to come up with an optimized investment strategy. And I know that because this involves math, a lot of us that are numbers-oriented want to be able to find that perfect solution. But there's a psychological reason why this optimization is actually not a great approach. And there's been some really interesting research into these different attitudes toward selection. And one of them is called maximizing, the ""maximizing mindset"" and the other one is called ""satisficing."" And what research has shown is that maximizing is all about trying to find the optimal choice, selecting the optimal choice for you. And we can do this in every domain of life from finding the perfect investment vehicle, or the perfect mate, the perfect restaurant, whatever it is, we try to optimize and maximize our well-being, maximize the utility that we're getting from something. Maximizing is looking for the best.

Satisficing is a totally different approach that sets sort of a standard, a bar above which, as long as the option that you're looking at meets or exceeds this particular standard that you set, you will be satisfied with the outcome. And what research has shown repeatedly is that people with a maximizing mindset often make an objectively better decision than the satisficers do. So, they do end up choosing the better option in the end. But when they're measured on satisfaction, on confidence in their choice, and on measures of things like depression, and overall well-being as related to the choice, maximizers are less happy with their choice than satisficers, even though they've objectively made a better choice. And part of the theory here is that what happens with a maximizing mindset is that you get so fixated on finding the perfect thing that you're never satisfied. Whereas if you have a satisficing mindset, the challenge is to set your standard of satisfaction high enough that you truly will be satisfied. And then beyond that, you stop searching for a better alternative.

So, I think to put this in a little bit more concrete terms, let's say you speculate on a company you think is really poised for growth, and you invest in that company. And it returns 400% return in the first year. Are you satisfied with a 400% return, or are you concerned with well, how high can it go? And a maximizing mindset won't be able to sell a winner, because you're fixated on getting the absolute most return you could possibly get. And so, you get fixated on timing the top. Where a satisficing mindset says, look a 400% return is a great return on my money. I'm going to take that and find another bargain somewhere.

Benz: I know that you're super-interested in the topic of financial education and helping people learn about investing in personal finance. I wanted to ask what you think about the stock market game that a lot of schools use to teach students about investing? Do you think that's productive? Or should they be doing something else to help kids get information and help them get engaged?

Newcomb: I have a lot of mixed feelings here. I know the people that run the stock market game, and I think that they are--it's a laudable effort, and I think there are some pros and some cons to it. The pros are that it definitely gets kids interested, and it makes the stock market feel accessible and fun to them. That's great. The cons are that when you think about it, the way the stock market game works is it's generally a one-yearlong competition and whoever gets the highest return wins. And so, what you're teaching them to do is to chase short-term returns. Because the team that wins is most likely--the best strategy for short-term returns is speculation, not long-term investment. You want to speculate and buy penny stocks and hope that you get a 5,000% return in that year. And you don't learn the benefits of long-term fundamental analysis when you are focused on chasing one-year returns.

It's difficult, though, to come up with a really strong alternative that's engaging enough, because with a 30-year timeline, the long-term investment takes a long time to see the payout. And it tends to be very boring in comparison. And I think the challenge for teaching kids or teaching anyone really about the stock market is to contract that 30-year timeline into something short-term so that you can get that adrenaline rush of the payoff without having to wait 30 years for it. But I think that the stock market game and getting kids involved in any kind of investment competition, where the metric of success is returns, and the time frame is short-term, you're setting them up to speculate, not to invest.

Ptak: So maybe to build on your answer there. How do you think do-it-yourself investors can balance their urge to dabble in individual stocks with the need to invest in a way that gets them to their goals? And how can advisors help their clients scratch that itch to pick stocks, while doing what's best for them? Is it reasonable, you think, to maintain sort of that separate ""mad money"" account?

Newcomb: I think it's a great question. Because the thing is that speculation is fun and legal and can be really lucrative. And it's one thing that really gets people involved in the stock market, is the idea that their money can grow quickly. So, I'm definitely pro speculation, I think speculation is great, so long as you play. The thing is that speculation and investment are two different games. And there's a different set of rules for each game. So, you need to know which game you're playing, and you need to do it responsibly. So long-term investment is slow and steady and fairly boring. And it's not going to give you that adrenaline rush. And many of us who like to see returns and who are impatient and want to see our money grow quickly, are more drawn to picking individual stocks, trying to find that way to get an edge on the market.

And I think having a separate mad money account, that's a reasonable percentage of your portfolio where you can afford to lose that money completely, and you're not going to be kicked off your trajectory toward long-term solvency then I think it's great. And if you make a lot of money speculating, then you've got more money to speculate with. But if you lose it, you're not losing sleep over it. And I think that having that percentage, having your fun money, I call it my gambling fund, it's a separate investment account that I've got set up for picking individual stocks. And it's great because I can scratch that itch. And I can get involved in investing in the things that I think are really exciting. But I'm never worried that I'm putting my financial future at risk by doing that. And if you're speculating with too large a portion of your assets, then you're going to be far more sensitive to the volatility of the stock market, because you're not as well diversified. I do think that it's great to let people play, but let them play with a responsible amount of money so that they're not sabotaging their long-term outcomes for short-term adrenaline.

Benz: Going back to the topic of financial education, we had Professor John Lynch on the podcast a while back, and he asserted that a lot of financial education doesn't stick and contribute to better outcomes because it decays over time, like a lot of education that we receive along the way. Does that jibe with your observation and what do we do with that? How do we change up what we're doing with financial education to address potential decay?

Newcomb: What I think Professor Lynch was referring to are the studies that show the memory decay of concepts after participating in certain financial literacy courses. And I've seen that research, too. And the thing about a lot of mathematical knowledge is like this; a lot of knowledge is sort of ""use it or lose it."" You can learn a topic, but if you're not actually putting it into practice, we don't remember facts unless they're repeated and repeated and repeated. And so, if you're not using it, then you're going to lose that knowledge. And the sort of use-it-or-lose-it nature of these topics make it very, very difficult to create really effective financial literacy programs.

I don't agree that financial literacy doesn't work, and I don't think that John was trying to say that it doesn't work as a blanket statement. But I do think that we have to pay attention to the teaching approaches and making sure that the ways that we are trying to communicate this information, let's use the knowledge that we have about what does work, and what we're seeing is sticking. And I think we've seen a lot of evidence that just-in-time financial education is really a lot more people are receptive to learning when there is something in their life, there is a financial decision that they're trying to make. For example, if you learn about a lot of different types of mortgages and interest-rate structures in high school, you may or may not remember that when you go to buy a house, depending on how interesting and engaged you were when you took the course. But when you're about to finance the largest, probably the largest purchase you've ever made, you're a lot more open to learning about the ins and outs of different mortgage products.

And so just-in-time financial education takes advantage of the emotional and psychological engagement of the moment and provides just the information that's needed at the right time to be able to then be put into practice right then. So that you do use it, and you're less likely to lose it, because you have put it into practice.

Ptak: As we've been talking about, it's hard not to be compelled by the just-in-time concept, but the question is how realistic it is to insert financial education into point-of-purchase decisions? 401(k) plans are maybe a best-case scenario where the employee generally wants, or I should say the employer generally wants what's best for the employee, but there's no such good actor in many other financial decision-making situations. So, can you think of practical ways that more just-in-time education can happen if it is feasible in some of those scenarios?

Newcomb: That's a really good point. And I think embedded in your question is the reality that we have this interesting situation where the financial services and advice industry is regulated under the caveat emptor framework, which is buyer beware. And so, the onus is on the customer to understand the products that they're buying. And how this sort of dovetails with just-in-time financial education is that people may not understand the math, or the pros and cons, or the different attributes, that are involved in the product-selection process when they're about to, say buy either a security or sign a loan product. In fact, a lot of people don't even think about these things as financial products. It's only in the finance industry that we use that term ""financial product."" Most people, most of the customers, aren't thinking about products like they're on a shelf and they can compare them by attribute.

What happens is that when people are ripe for learning about a particular financial decision, they will go and seek out information because the onus is on them to understand the products that they buy and the decisions that they make. And who's right there, really eager to give them all the information that they could want, so long as it's bent in their own version of things, is the sellers of those products. And so sometimes we end up with a situation where you have people who are very vulnerable to marketing and to misinformation, being the target of explanations, or basically marketing pitches that seem like they're financial education. So, there'll be workshops that try to teach you about retirement that really are trying to sell you a product. And because they do have some education embedded in them, they can be useful to some extent. But the customer is sort of an easy target for manipulation, because they don't know what they don't know.

And I do think that there are some ways we can get around this, I think that there are already some great solutions out there, some fintech firms that are trying to use things like alerts to monitoring transactions, monitoring things like your credit score. Credit Karma for instance, if they see a change in your credit score, they'll alert you to it. That's a great time to educate people about how to improve their credit score, or what kind of loan products they might qualify for, etc. So, in that case you're using the alert about a change in the person's either balance sheet or credit information to trigger that just-in-time moment for education. But even Credit Karma is trying to sell you credit cards or loan opportunities. You have to question whether the incentives are truly aligned.

I think that we could really, there's an opportunity here for better alignment between the people who have access to really holistic financial data about people, namely banks, who have all their transaction and balance information, and nonprofit financial literacy organizations. If we had some better alignment there, then maybe some of the people who are out there trying to teach sound financial literacy could have more of that, could find those moments through the banks being able to send an alert to someone if there is some behavioral or transactional data that alerts them to a critical moment that might be happening in a person's financial life. Could then surface the appropriate information and financial literacy information that they could use at that moment.

Again, even the banks tend to be commercial. So, we have an issue where there's often a misalignment between the interests of the seller and the interests of the buyer. And there's a huge asymmetry of information. And yet the onus of responsibility is on the buyer, who doesn't know what they don't know. I do think it's a big problem. I also think every problem is an opportunity. And there are ways that I think fintech can come in and be smart about what information they present to who and how. But I do think it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of commercial for-profit institutions that have that data, partnering with people who are trying to get the knowledge into the hands of the people that need it.

Benz: We want to switch over to discuss financial wellness and all that that encompasses. You've been working on a project that aims to help people quickly size up key metrics of their financial health. How are you aiming to get beyond the usual metrics like net worth statements when it comes to gauging financial wellness?

Newcomb: This project has been really a labor of love over the last year for me. I've been trying to figure out a good way to do personal financial statement analysis, much in the way that we look at financial statements of companies and look at things like their price/earnings ratio. I've been asking the question, ""What are some key ratios and statistics that we can glean from our personal balance sheets in order to find out how healthy our own financial management is?"" And I have some training in personal financial planning and went back to some of that information, the kinds of things that financial planners are trained in.

And generally what we do is we create a balance sheet and a cash flow statement and try to create something like a net worth goal over time, but I think there's so much more that we can look at to help us understand not just where we stand right now, but the trajectory of our wealth, the potential longevity of our wealth, measures of short- and long-term solvency. Some of the things that help us understand not just where we are, but how resilient we may be to shocks and losses. And putting these things into really simple metrics that are easy to calculate and easy to understand. So that we can set short- and long-term goals and track these things quickly over time.

And so, this has been a big project for me. And I've been thinking about it a lot, and most common is this net worth metric, but net worth is pretty meaningless on its own, I mean, what's $1 million? Well, if you spend $40,000 a year, then $1 million is a 25-to-1 ratio, which represents under pretty simple assumptions of inflation and growth expectations. A 25-to-1 ratio pretty much represents, you can retire, you're going to be financially independent, you're not going to outlive your money. But if you spend $200,000 a year, then that's only a 5-to-1 wealth-to-spend ratio, and that's only going to last you six or seven years under the same assumptions.

And so, being able to contextualize net worth into this ratio of wealth to spending is a really simple way to set a goal and say, look, I'm looking for a 15-to-1 ratio by the time I'm 60. Some people have already blown past that 20-to-1 ratio. And if you look at it that way, you might be able to say, well, if I have a 25-to-1 ratio, my wealth will last me 35 years on my current spending, just putting it into context. So that's one thing that I think is really helpful. Another one is looking at the trajectory of your balance sheet. And this is also fairly easy to calculate. What you do is you add up all the interest that you're paying on your debt--not the amount that you're paying down on your debt, just the interest that you're paying, just the money you're paying to own that debt in the first place. And you subtract that from the amount you expect your assets to grow over the next year.

Let's say you've got $100,000, growing at about 7% in a retirement account, so then you're looking at about $7,000 in interest on that account, in a year's time. But if you're paying $10,000 in interest on your debt, then you've actually got a $3,000 drag on your balance sheet because of the way that you've set up your accounts. And this concept of a base growth rate is another really simple statistic that you can calculate to find out before you add to your asset accounts. And before you pay down your debt, if you're just looking at the amount that your assets are earning in the accounts that they're currently in, invested as they are currently invested, and just the amount that you're spending on interest. Then, if you have a negative base growth rate, that's an immediate red flag that your debt needs attention. And so, before you go and invest more, you should probably either refinance some debt, or move some assets to pay down that debt, or somehow get that base growth rate to positive before you even start to add more to your assets and pay down your debt.

It's a way of finding out, is your balance sheet in balance? If you do nothing, is it going to grow, or shrink? And I think it's a really great way to look at that underlying health of your balance sheet. And it's two very simple numbers to calculate. And you subtract one from the other and you've got this very illuminating statistic. So those are the kinds of things that I've been scouring the Earth for, to try to find the things that we can use to illuminate our personal finance, so that we can see where we're at, see where we're going, and set some goals and track. If we track these simple metrics over time, we'll make better decisions than we would just by looking at our net worth.

Ptak: One challenge for everyone in the financial planning and investment space is getting people to prioritize the future. Are you compelled by research that shows getting people to empathize with their future selves works, for example, by showing them images of what they might look like later in life? Are there any tools that you could recommend in this vein?

Newcomb: Yes, so I have done a lot of research in this area and been inspired by some great academic researchers in this area, Hal Hershfield, Gabriel Edington, and some others. What I've seen in my own research is an extremely strong connection between how far into the future people tend to think and plan, and how much they have saved or acquired in assets. And when you think about it, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you want to be investing for the long term, you need to be able to think long-term. But we're not all naturally long-term thinkers. Some people are blessed with that as a trait, and they are naturally thinking 10, 20 years ahead, and those people are going to tend to be better planners and better savers than people like me who naturally think just a very short period of time ahead. And if you're only thinking a month into the future, what happens is that your discount rate--this has been connected in many studies, that people who are short-term thinkers have a higher discount rate--we have higher levels of present bias, which means that we are less likely to actually feel that we discount the cost. If we get the benefit today, then we overvalue the benefit in our mind's eye compared to the cost down the line, which we shrink in our mental estimation.

And when you do that mental cost-benefit analysis, the benefit of a small amount of money today feels a lot more than the benefit of a large amount of money in the future. Because the future is so far off in our mind's eye, that it's like a landscape painting, we shrink everything down. And we see it as small in comparison to this up-close benefit that we're getting right now. And that effect, we all have that effect in our brains to some extent. But people who are short-term thinkers, it's more pronounced, we have a higher discount rate. And for people who are naturally short-term thinkers, training our mind to think further ahead, training our brains to think further ahead and to see into the long view, can be an extremely valuable habit of mind to cultivate.

Now, naturally, long-term thinkers don't need to do this, because they're probably already doing it. But this is especially useful for people who are short-term thinkers. And most of the research that's been done in this space has been done on college students who are young, and the research shows that your mental time horizon does elongate naturally with age. We tend to think further ahead as we get older. But the problem is that by the time we're naturally thinking about retirement age, sometimes for those of us that weren't thinking far ahead in the future, it takes us too long. We're already in our late 30s or 40s by the time we're concerned about retirement, and at that point, it may be too late to catch up. And training your mind to think further ahead as soon as possible is an extremely efficient use of resources, because it doesn't cost anything. It's very simple and it's very effective. But, how to do it?

There have been some tools that were developed to do this. Hal Hershfield teamed up with Merrill Lynch a few years back, and they created, it was Merrill Edge, they created this thing called “Face Retirement,” where you would take a photo on your webcam, and it would age-progress it. And it was cute, and it showed you some stats about retirement and I don't know if it's still up or not. I don't know how effective it was. The graphics were definitely in the uncanny valley where it was a little bit creepy to look at this future version of yourself staring back at you. But it can be very effective, because what it's doing is, it's shrinking that psychological distance in your mind's eye and it's making the future seem more real, more detailed, and therefore, our brains translate it as more likely. And so those of us who are not naturally inclined to think in the long term, interventions like age-progressing your face can help sort of jump-drive that or jump-start your imagination to seeing the long term.

But you don't really need tools. All you need is to think a little bit further ahead than you normally do. If you're normally planning about a year out, then maybe think about five years out. And what you want to do is really infuse your picture of your life in that time period with as many concrete details as possible. Because what happens when we think about the future, the further something is out in our mind's eye, in time, the more we will see it, we paint with a broad brush. So when we think about things that are close up, we see the details, we think about the concrete things, the things we have to do, the how of what we're doing, when we think about something that's far off, because we know that there's uncertainty involved, we paint with a really broad brush. And we see things sort of abstract. A lot of people think about retirement and they think, oh, yeah, I just want to relax in retirement.

Well, what's far more useful is to go way beyond saying I want to relax in retirement and to get really specific. Think about a day in your life. Where do you want to be living? Is it in a house, a condo, is it in the country, is it in the city? What are you going to be doing with your time? How will you fill a typical day? And really think through it. Financial advisors have been taught to do this with clients since the beginning of the profession. What science is doing now is sort of filling in the, Why does this work? And the reason why it works, the reason why infusing your picture of the future you and your future life with concrete details helps you to be more long-term oriented, is because it helps shrink the psychological distance between the known today and this far-off future that feels very abstract and unknown. And the better you can see it, the more likely you are to plan for it, because the more emotionally engaged you'll be with it, and the more your brain sees it as a reality. So short-term thinkers have got to learn how to think about the long term in great detail. Long-term thinkers are probably already doing it, so just keep it up.

Benz: You wrote a piece entitled, ""Is Instagram Making You Poor?"" for Psychology Today, a few years ago. So how do social media and comparing ourselves to others work against our ability to save for the future and even think about the future?

Newcomb: Social comparisons is a big topic. We all know that keeping up with the Joneses is a huge resource suck on many people. But it can be difficult not to do it because we're social creatures. Social comparison theory states basically that we all need to know sort of where we stand. We want to know, how are we doing at this life thing? And when we don't have an objective measure by which to judge ourselves or our progress, what we do is we look around us for a similar other to compare ourselves with. And this is such a natural inclination that we don't even notice ourselves doing it. And when we compare ourselves to others, I wanted to know how social comparisons were affecting people's bottom line. And so, I did a number of surveys, asking people about who they compare themselves with, how often, whether they're comparing themselves with people they think are higher on the socioeconomic ladder or lower. And then I asked a series of questions about their financial well-being. So specifically, I was asking them about their emotional experiences with money, how often they felt joy, peace, satisfaction, and pride, versus how often they were feeling anger, stress, helplessness, and anxiety with respect to their money.

What I found in analyzing the results of this was that first of all, most people are comparing themselves financially--no big surprise there. And in every income group, most people are comparing themselves with those that they believe are better off. Not everyone, but more than half of the people in every income group are looking up the socioeconomic ladder when they compare themselves. And then I looked at the correlation between that upward comparison versus downward comparison and the emotional experience with money. And it was no big surprise to me to find that the people who were comparing themselves with those they thought were doing better, were experiencing more stress, lower satisfaction, and not only that--they were spending more and saving less, because they were trying to reach that higher level or live the lifestyle that they were looking at and admiring.

We end up with a situation where this need to compare ourselves may actually be driving us to lower financial health, because the people that we tend to compare ourselves with are doing better, and so the natural comparison makes us feel bad. And in order to deal with that psychological pain, some people spend in order to try to achieve the lifestyle that they're admiring of the person higher up the ladder. There was, however, in this research, a very interesting finding, which was that who people compare themselves with made a big difference in one particular category. There was this one little group of people that said, they compare themselves not to their friends or families or neighbors or celebrities, or even themselves at a previous time in life. All of those people who were making those comparisons, which was the vast majority followed this pattern, where if they looked up, they felt bad; if they looked down, they felt great. And most of them were looking up and therefore feeling bad.

This one little group compared themselves with a financial role model--specifically a financial role model. And they, regardless of whether they were looking up or down the socioeconomic ladder at that role model, they were feeling consistently more financial satisfaction, regardless of their income level and regardless of which way they were looking up the ladder, up or down the ladder.

And it really, I think, illustrates the difference between what I would call evaluative comparison, which asks the question, “Do I measure up right now?” And aspirational comparison, which asks the question, “Can I follow in their footsteps and be where they are in the future?” Which you may have noticed is a future-oriented question. And so, it also ties into that long-term view. But when we look up the socioeconomic ladder and compare ourselves with people that we think are doing better, we may think we're being aspirational in doing so. But if the question you're asking yourself is, “Do I measure up?” And you're looking up the ladder, of course, the answer is no. You don't measure up because you're choosing a target that's doing better than you are, at least you think they are--you can't see their debt.

But those that choose a financial role model, don't ask that question, “Do I measure up now?” They're looking at someone who, who has made decisions that they want to emulate, and they're asking, “What can I do to be more like them? How can I follow in their footsteps?” Then you can say no, “I don't measure up now, but that's OK, because I can do what they've done.” And that's the difference between aspirational, true aspirational comparison, which can be very healthy and adaptive and motivating, and evaluative comparison, which is maladaptive and unhealthy and demotivating.

Ptak: Let's shift and talk about the pandemic. Some consumers were able to use the pandemic period as an opportunity to repair their household balance sheets. American savings rates soared, especially in the early part of the pandemic. The question is, how can those consumers hold on to those healthy habits, even as the economy has opened back up, and there are more spending opportunities? What do you think?

Newcomb: I was so happy to see that finally Americans were saving, but it took a crisis. And I think there's a couple things we have to try to remember, in order to hold on to this new habit of saving. First of all, remember how scary it is to realize you don't have solvency--the state of people's emergency funds in this country are atrocious. We all have probably been exposed to one stat or another that you know that the majority, or at least 40% of Americans, couldn't come up with $400 at a moment's notice without borrowing it from someone or going into debt or putting it on credit. That is a very alarming statistic, because what that means is that we walked into this pandemic largely insolvent. Many, many, many households don't even have short-term solvency and you can't even think about long-term solvency without short-term solvency.

When people are afraid, they save, and then when they're not afraid anymore, they spend. And I'm all for consumer confidence, I think that's great. I'm not anti-spending. But I do think that we have to first of all remember how scary it is to not have solvency, remember how scary it was, if you were one of those people that decided you absolutely needed to start saving, and you wished you had been doing it all along. Try to remember that feeling, because you don't want to be there again, and you don't have to be there again. Then on the other hand, really holding on to that feeling of how good it feels, to have a bit of solvency, to have some slack, to have some security. I generally don't talk about emergency fund in those terms--I think of it in terms of months of safety. How long could you go on your liquid assets, if you lost your income today, just with the money that you could get your hands on in a week or less with no penalties? How long could you maintain your current lifestyle before you'd have to make changes? That's your safety net. It tells you how much freedom you have to be able to handle a shock, or to rebuild after a shock, or to make a major transition.

And I think that what the pandemic really exposed for many people was a basic need for solvency. And I hope that we will really emotionally remember how it feels to be insolvent, and then start to really appreciate how good it feels to be solvent. Because those of us who are not saving enough--which you know, listeners to this podcast probably are great savers--but maybe you know someone who's not a very good saver. Generally, it's because saving doesn't feel as good as spending. We do things that feel good to us, we do cost-benefit analysis all the time. And if what you choose is to spend, then that's because spending won out in your mental cost-benefit analysis. The emotional, the nonfinancial benefits outweighed the financial costs. And your overall utility of spending in your mind's eye was greater.

So, in order to keep this habit of saving, we have to love saving, we have to like the feeling of having money more than the feeling of spending money. I think really leaning into that--many people don't, they feel like it makes them greedy, or somehow we have all these negative connotations around money and greed in our society. And the idea of really sort of savoring that feeling of having money can feel very strange and even bad to some people, especially those who haven't had money. And I think just really leaning into the feeling of security and stability and peace of mind that having money brings, to help you to counter the temptation to go and get the short-term payoff of that new thing that you want. I'm all for spending so long as you maintain that solvency that allows you to sleep at night, and to think long-term and to bounce back when there's another shock, because there will be one.

Benz: What inning would you say we're in, in terms of behavioral science and psychology permeating the investing and finance areas?

Newcomb: I think I would say maybe the fourth or fifth inning. We've gone through periods of establishing the models of behavioral economics as both psychologically and empirically valid. We've gotten the message out that these models of decision-making work and are often more accurate than our rational choice models. And the field has gained notoriety, the academic journals have expanded, and there's more respect for the field both in academia and in the private sector. I think that there's a widespread knowledge now of behavioral science as a field of some of the major models and concepts of behavioral science. So, we've sort of permeated the landscape of finance, but I think that we still have a long way to go in terms of maturing as a field and specifically coming up with proven solutions.

Behavioral science has a lot to say about how we deviate from rational decisions, has a lot to say about how we make maybe imperfect decisions, or how we can get in our own way financially. But we have very few proven methods for solving these things. These are difficult problems to solve, because the work required in order to create proven solutions, it involves field tests in the wild of actual financial interventions and psychological interventions. And a lot of people are--it's very hard to get access to the kind of data that is necessary to perform these studies, because a lot of people don't want their financial information to be exposed to researchers, people are loath to be experimented on, they don't want to be part of the trial, they want only the proven solution. And so a lot of the companies that have the data that the researchers need in order to create these randomized control trials that will allow us to create proven solutions, there's a lot of barriers to getting that data into the hands of researchers, to getting the types of interventions that might help to be tried and validated.

Some of that work is being done. But it would go a lot faster if there was more of an appetite for trying new things. It's just difficult. It's difficult, in the intervention space, in the solution space. We've got a lot of things that maybe work in the lab with volunteers and college students, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it works in real life with all the other types of noise around us in decision-making. I think that we still have a long way to go to mature, and to be able to provide real solutions beyond just explaining the problem to people.

Benz: Behavioral finance researchers like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler have become celebrities in the financial industry over the past couple of decades. Are there any researchers whose work you feel is underappreciated relative to its importance?

Newcomb: I do. Yes, I think I have got to shout out to Gerd Gigerenzer. He is a contemporary of Thaler and Kahneman and Cass Sunstein. And his work, he's got a great book that is about, it's about smart shortcuts is what I call them. And I did a series a couple years back on Morningstar about simple shortcuts that make us smart. What Gigerenzer, the point that he's trying to make and the bit that he's bringing, the angle that he's bringing to the academic and public discourse on the topic of behavioral finance, is that heuristics are actually in many cases, adaptive strategies for making good-enough decisions under the constraints of time and information that we have to deal with. And heuristics are our beautiful brain's wonderful way of being able to make really good decisions when we don't have enough time to process all the information, or we don't have enough information to really assess the problem. We can still make a good-enough decision with some smart heuristics.

The issue is that when we misuse heuristics--and heuristics are rules of thumb, they're the simplifications that our minds create in order to make fast decisions under uncertainty and time constraints. And so, heuristics can be very adaptive, they can be very beneficial, but they can be maladaptive in two specific cases. First of all, when taken to an extreme, they can, anything taken to an extreme can be maladaptive, but heuristics either used in the wrong situation, or taken to an extreme can lead to biases, and biases are really the things that are the enemy of good choices, not heuristics themselves. So Gigerenzer I think deserves a lot more notoriety and should be getting a lot more play in the media because he's really, I think, illuminating how we can work with heuristics to make really great choices. Instead of trying to turn ourselves into robots by figuring out all the ways that we're irrational and then trying to be more rational. I think it's much easier to work with our brains rather than against them.

Ptak: There's been a lot of interest in the investments and financial-services industry, in customization, for example, services that allow investors to customize a portfolio based on their preferences, which can include ESG preferences or their tax circumstances. Can you discuss what you see as the pros and cons of that kind of customization from your standpoint? It seems an investor might be more likely to stick with a customized portfolio, but are investors in a good position to understand the trade-offs of some of the choices they're making, for instance, by removing all the energy exposure from their portfolio?

Newcomb: I'm generally pro customization, I think it's great to be able to align the portfolio with the person. But again, I want to go back to this idea of the maximizing versus satisficing mindset. Where if you're so focused on getting the perfect portfolio for you, you might end up really in a situation where you're paralyzed and can't pick one. I think that customization to an extent is great but understanding the limits that if we go too far down the bespoke portfolio rabbit hole, you can end up with trying to overfit the portfolio to the person.

And, our preferences are not necessarily stable. What we want is, is for our portfolios to match the things that we care about deeply, the things that, the goals that we want to achieve. And yes, someone may be more likely to stick with a highly customized portfolio. But I think what really it comes down to is that we're a lot more likely to stick with an investment strategy that we understand. Because then when moments of uncertainty and volatility happen, we can look at the investment strategy that we've chosen. And if we understand it, if a client can explain the overall strategy of their investment portfolio, in their own words, not your words, but their own words, then they truly understand it. And when they understand it, their confidence in it is going to increase and when their confidence in it is higher, then they're more likely to stick with it.

It's not so much that they want it to match them perfectly. It's that they need to understand it and believe in the strategy so that when things get rough, and they will, they can hold tight to that strategy. If someone doesn't fully understand the strategy, then when they start losing money, they're going to doubt the validity of that strategy. And I think that transparency, financial education, teaching people why you're investing, why their strategy is right for them--that's where the magic really happens. So much of the financial advice industry seems to be relying on trying to blind clients with all this knowledge and techno speak. And we obfuscate where we should be simplifying. What really is valuable to people when it comes to a financial plan or an investment strategy is the confidence that they know that they've made good decisions.

And so that comes from understanding, not from just trusting someone to be smarter than them. That doesn't help them stay in when things get hard. What helps is if they themselves really understand. So, I think that it's interesting, because I feel like I'm in an industry that loves to use big words and complex equations, and I'm here saying we need to think about feelings, and we need to simplify everything. But I think it's really true. We make so much out of the math and we forget that, our lives do not revolve around our investments. It's the other way around. And, if people can trust that they've made sound--that their investment portfolio was made on sound principles that they understand, then they're going to be able to stay with it when it gets tough.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I’m Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I’m Jeff Ptak, chief ratings officer for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Today we’re welcoming back Ramit Sethi. Ramit is a personal finance expert and author. And this year, he added a new line item to his resume: TV host. His series How to Get Rich debuted on Netflix in April. It features in-depth conversations with individuals about their financial lives. Ramit’s first book, I Will Teach You to Be Rich, published in 2009, was a bestseller; a second edition of the book came out in 2019. Ramit is the founder of iwillteachyoutoberich.com and he’s also the host of a podcast called I Will Teach You To Be Rich, which features in-depth conversations with couples about money. Ramit, welcome back to The Long View.

Ramit Sethi: Thanks for having me again.

Benz: Well, thanks for being here. I think you’re our only three-repeat guest so far, so this is terrific.

Sethi: I’m flattered.

Benz: We want to talk about your new Netflix show How To Get Rich. You manage to find people who are super relatable and you do a great job of working with them. I guess the question is, is it hard to find people who are willing to open up that completely about their money situations? Or do you think it’s getting less taboo to talk about money?

Sethi: It is hard. It is hard to find and I’ve experienced it in two different ways. One on the show, and one on my own podcast where I interview couples. When we first started, we were not sure how open people would be with their finances because really, especially in America, sharing your finances is the most intimate thing you can do. Far more intimate than talking even about your sex life. There’s actually research indicating that people would be more likely to discuss that versus their credit card debt. But what we discovered is that some people are actually quite willing to share everything—all their financials, all their documents—if they believe that there is help at the end of the tunnel. And I really think that that speaks to how much people feel alone when it comes to money, that they’re actually willing to share anything and everything, if someone can actually help them.

Ptak: In one of the episodes, one of the people you were working with said that she was expecting to work with you on spreadsheets and net worth statements and so on, and she was surprised when you wanted to delve into relationships and other more personal aspects of financial decision-making. Was that type of reservation common in your interactions that people wanted to stay on a surface level, but you wanted to dig deeper in order to find out what was really going on?

Sethi: Always. People always think that I’m going to walk in and hand them some magical budget that’s going to solve all their financial problems. I go, “Do you even want that?” They go, “Yes!” I go, “Really? When was the last time you used a budget?” They go, “In 1998 we used it for three months.” I go, “You don’t even like budgets. So why do you want me to come in and give you a budget? That sucks!” But, it’s interesting where this idea comes from. The financial industry talks like this. They’ll say phrases: “Let’s give people the tools and the information to make the right decisions.” People aren’t robots. They don’t use information alone to make decisions. Most people are buying the things they want and then finding a way to logically justify it later. So, this whole myth that people sit down and rationally weigh out all the different decision-making principles, it’s a total myth. People buy what they want. They do not use ratios, almost ever when it comes to making huge financial decisions. And so yeah, I want to know how did they grow up with money? What phrases were said around the dinner table? How do they feel about money? And we can get to the numbers and we can talk ratios, but most people are quite surprised because they really think that I’m going to walk in with some calculator in my pocket and whip out some calculation. That’s not going to happen.

Benz: You’ve been having these conversations with people about their finances for a while. You referenced your podcast that you do with couples, and now the Netflix show. Have you gotten better at warming people up and getting them more comfortable with sharing some of the deeper details about how they got to the place that they’re at with their finances?

Sethi: Gosh, I sure hope so. I’ve been doing it a lot. So, if I haven’t, then there’s a real problem. I’ll leave it to you to judge. I’ve done about 100 episodes of my podcast. I think that there’s quite a marked difference between episode one and the most recent episode. I will share a couple of insights that I’ve had along the way. In order to get people to share this information, part of it is simply screening. It’s just making it very clear that we require you to share everything: income, debt, everything. And so, some people are not comfortable with that and that’s perfectly fine. But we don’t want any secrets. We want to know everything because that enables me to help you.

The other thing is I have been given the luxury of time. When I speak to people on my podcast, I block out three hours, but I always leave an extra hour just in case it runs long and it has run long. With the Netflix show, I had the opportunity to spend weeks with people. That meant I got to see them in person, I got to see them in their home, in their hometown. I also stayed in touch. I would text them when I was on a different coast, “Hey, what’s going on? Fill me in, let’s talk.” And I think people were surprised that I really cared—but I get invested. I’m eating lunch with them. I’m meeting their family. Their success becomes my success. So, the rapport-building with people is so important. I would argue it is at least as important as running any type of analysis. If people don’t like you and they don’t believe that you understand them, that’s the end of the conversation.

Ptak: Does it ever happen that people aren’t being totally honest with you about their actual financial situations? There were several scenes in the show where people dragged out piles of unpaid bills even though they had supposedly already given you all the details of their financial situations. Is that commonplace?

Sethi: It’s interesting. I wouldn’t know if they lied to me. But it almost seems preposterous that people would tell me the exact amount of debt that they would be openly crying about, something their mom said when they were seven years old and then they would be hiding some DMV bill. I think what is more common is that people use mental bucketing quite effectively to tell themselves a story. You see this commonly with people who have large amounts of student loan debt, such as Frank on the Netflix show. People simply count that as something totally different. They’ll go, “Well I make $70,000, and I have $10,000 in credit card debt, so I’m doing all right.” I go, “What about that $212,000 in student loan debt?” And they just look up they go, “Oh, I don’t really think about that.” I go, “Well, it’s debt, right?” They go, “Yeah, but I’m going to die with that.” And it’s kind of a joke, but it’s also kind of not. Again, mental bucketing—it is so overwhelmingly large or so intractable from their perspective that they simply do not even count it. And part of what I get to do is to say even if you have $200,000 of debt, we can make a plan and we can get on top of this, but we’ve got to be honest with ourselves and honest with the people around us.

Benz: I want to follow up on this mental-bucketing idea. Do you think that it can be healthy sometimes for people to have buckets in place, different silos of money? Or do you think it’s generally not a good idea.

Sethi: I think it can actually be quite effective if you use it strategically, so I’ll give you an example. I have what I call Ramit’s 10 money rules—these are my rules, they’re not yours. They’re just the rules that I’ve developed and some of them are quite straightforward, like save 10%, invest 20% of gross—basic stuff. Again, adjust the numbers if you want to borrow my rule for your own situation. But I also have ones like never question spending money on books, appetizers, health, or donating to a friend’s charity fundraiser. So, if I see anything relating to health or a book, done. I don’t care how much it costs, it’s not a question; I’m going to spend on it. I think that it is important for us to come up with a few categories or even items in our life where we say, I’m giving myself the freedom to not even think twice about it. And intuitively every parent knows this because if you ever bought a certain brand of diapers, you don’t care how much it costs you go, that’s my diaper, and that’s what I’m going to get. So, we all know that we’ve got something in our life we will spend anything on. My request for everyone is to be strategic about that and to really say, whether it’s “I love this brand of tuna” or “I love this pack of gum.” Or it could be as extravagant as “I love this brand of cashmere coat.” It’s up to you—what is your rich life? But I want you to be strategic about it and you can use mental bucketing to help that.

Ptak: Do you plan to follow up with people who you featured on the show to see whether they were able to enact positive long-term changes in their financial lives?

Sethi: Oh yes, in fact I have. I reached out to them and I have started sharing their recent stories, which are a year past when we filmed, on my podcast. And so most recently I have shared Matt and Amani’s story. They are the first couple that you see in episode one. And I’ve shared Natalie story, who you see also in episode one. I met her on Rodeo Drive. And I will be featuring as much of the cast as possible. So, you can actually see them on my YouTube videos and hear them and we go over all their numbers, what’s changed, and in some cases, what has not changed.

Benz: Well, that’s what I wanted to ask about. Thinking about those episode-one people especially, those were the ones I left a little bit worried about. But I’ll see where they went; I’ll follow up with you on that. I wanted to get back to your thesis, something that you talk a lot about, which is this idea of envisioning our what you call rich lives, and this is something we’ve talked about before. You’ve noted that when people talk about their rich lives they often talk about that in terms of what they don’t want to do versus something that they do want to do. Why do you think that is and what kinds of questions do you ask to get them to view their rich lives in a more positive light and to characterize them in a more positive light?

Sethi: It’s such a peculiar thing that we all do when asked what is your rich life? We will often respond by articulating a list of things we don’t want to do: “Well I don’t need to eat at the fanciest restaurants; it’s not like I need to fly on a private jet.” And we just start reciting this litany of phrases and I can see people, I can see their eyes and I watch them, and I bet you if I asked them 10 minutes later, do you remember what you told me? They would have no idea. It’s almost this automatic set of phrases of things they don’t want to do, and I believe that comes from the deep cultural, invisible scripts that we have around the puritanical nature of money in this country. That if we are actually able to forthrightly acknowledge what we want to do, what we would love to do, that we will be seen as frivolous or several other negative phrases that you can associate with the rich. And so, I want to take that idea of almost turning the word “rich” from an epithet to something that is aspirational. And again, your rich life can be yours. Your rich life is quite different than mine.

So, I do a few things; I use some techniques. I’ll ask them, “What does your rich life look like?” Almost everyone tells me the same answer: “I want to do what I want, when I want.” I go, “OK, what do you want?” They just stare at me with their mouth open. That really is a remarkable finding that most of us have never thought about our rich life. We go to work, we come home, we invest, we save. We agonize over the price of cereal, but we never actually thought about what it’s for. So, I’ll ask them another question: “What do you love spending money on? Not like, but love?” And everybody knows this intuitively. The most common answer is food, the next one is travel. The third one is health and wellness, and the fourth is convenience, and there’s a whole bunch of others. I call them money dials. I then follow up with a second question, I say “I love that. What if you could quadruple the amount that you spent on that? What would it look like and feel like?”

And this is such a beautiful moment because most of us have never actually envisioned spending more on the things we love. We’ve only been told by everyone around us and every financial expert out there that you got to cut back on everything: 5% on asparagus, 5% on housing, 5% on buses. So, somebody comes in here and goes “Wow, I love that you like to travel. What if you could quadruple it? Where would you go? Who would you take with you? What seat on the airline would you fly on?” So, those are a couple of techniques that I use. I go deeper—I’ll do a 10-year bucket list; I’ll talk about the perfect day. I’ll point out that in their perfect day, they certainly did not discuss spending an hour and a half on laundry. So might it be possible for us to use a little money to solve that problem? But overall, what I want to do is shift the conversation from one of negativity and restriction to one that’s actually fun and inspiring and your rich life fits you like a handmade glove.

Ptak: What do you think about bucket lists? It seems like they could be very polarizing. Some people like having a list of experiences they’re striving for while others think that people should work to make every day special, not just the African safari, so to speak. Where do you come down on that?

Sethi: I remember when I was applying to colleges and there was this FAQ from one very selective college and it said: Should students try to take an easier class and get an A or should they try to take a more difficult class and get a B? And the college was actually quite direct. They said we always encourage our prospects to take a more challenging class, but in our experience, our students take the more challenging class and they get an A. And I just love that. That lesson there is something I call yes and yes. Should you live a rich life today? Yes. And should you live an even richer life tomorrow? Yes. So, our rich life today might mean buying an extra charger for your phone, so you’ve got one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. What is that, $29? Fantastic. A richer life down the road could be at the end of this year you take a beautiful holiday and you spend an extra two days just the two of you. Or it might be three years from now where you celebrate your anniversary abroad, or a fantastic restaurant. So, I believe you can do both. Of course, you need to know your numbers, but beyond knowing your numbers, you’ve also got to create a vision, and that vision starts today and it can expand tomorrow.

Benz: Wanted to ask if it’s hard to set aside your own notions about financial management when working with people? On the show you featured a couple who are planning a wedding and finding that it was more expensive than they anticipated. And as I was watching that, my reaction was like, of course, they should shrink it! They should not have that expensive wedding. And yet they went and with your urging, they talked to their parents, and the parents agreed to kick in some funds for the wedding. So, I’m wondering how you deal with your own thoughts about prudent financial management when you are working with people who have a different world view?

Sethi: I’d love to answer that, but first I have a question for you, Christine. You said that you naturally thought that they should shrink their wedding. Why did you think that?

Benz: Well, I think there’s an elegance in doing what you can afford, and I think cheaper things can be done really elegantly. So, I guess that was what I was thinking like, oh, this could be so beautiful if it were a little smaller and just within your budget.

Sethi: Fantastic. OK, so this is beautiful. This really unearths some of our deeply held views about money. I come from an Indian background. If you know anything about Indian weddings, you know that they are extravagant, maximalist. They are cultural and family celebrations. In my culture, it is expected that you’re going to invite everybody in your community and in fact, that’s exactly what I did. I combined it with financial planning—I was saving for my wedding before I even met my wife because I knew one day I’m going to get married and I want to have an amazing wedding and I don’t even want money to be one of the top five concerns. So, I was putting money away diligently well in my 20s.

When I met Sarah and Reggie, who on the show were discussing a wedding, I asked them, “Is this important to you?” They said, “Yes.” I said, “Is it part of your rich life?” They said, “Yes.” I got curious. I said, “Tell me why.” And I know their background. They have a cultural background, which also encourages family bonding over weddings. I said, “OK great. We need to find a way to make sure that you can afford this. But if you want to spend a lot of money on this, let’s find a way to do it.” And so, my approach when it comes to working with people, whether on the show, my podcast, or through my newsletter, is not to tell people that’s a bad decision, because first of all I think a big wedding is awesome as long as you can afford it. I also think if you want to buy a dirt bike—I’m not into dirt bikes. I don’t ride on dirt bikes, but if you want to buy a dirt bike and it’s your rich life, I go, “Fantastic, let’s figure out how to use your money to do it.” So, often I have to put aside my own personal views. Like someone tells me, “Ramit, we retired in our 30s using your book and we drive around the country in an RV.” Personally, I don’t want to get an RV, but they love it. I go, “Fantastic. That’s your rich life; it’s totally different than mine.” That’s the beauty of intentionally designing your rich life.

Ptak: Wanted to shift and talk a bit about budgeting and conscious spending. You often talk about a conscious spending plan and you have a free spreadsheet that people can download. Can you talk about what that consists of?

Sethi: I’m not a fan of budgets. I don’t know anyone who effectively maintains a budget long term. And also, my worst hell on this planet is sitting and being 58 years old and tracking the price of asparagus at Safeway. I don’t want to live that life, ever. Furthermore, I actually find it very uninteresting. I spent this much last month—what does that tell me about going forward? And when you apply psychology to budgets, you recognize quickly why it does not stick. Here’s the basic message of budgets: “OK, everyday person on the street who doesn’t really pay attention to their money, I want you to open up a spreadsheet—again most people don’t even use Excel—I want you to open up a spreadsheet, I want you to find all the spending that you spent in the last 12 months. The spending that you don’t track at all and that you feel really guilty about. Go ahead and spend the next two months trying to gather all that information and type it in or integrate it somehow. And then you see a bunch of numbers and I want you to magically make sense of it and then use that to decide what to do next. By the way, you have to do this for the rest of your life.” Is it any surprise that no one actually keeps a budget for the long term.

The fact that this has not been discovered in the financial industry absolutely blows my mind, and I credit a lot of this to my studying psychology at Stanford when I realized certain things about how we are cognitive misers, how we carefully ration out our attention on the things that matter. And so, for me, I want to simplify and I want to focus on the high-leverage items in personal finance. I call them “the big wins.” And with a conscious spending plan—I think I have one at my website, iwt.com/csp. There’s four numbers that I track—I track these myself personally as well. The first one is fixed costs. And I give people an actual percentage. I find that specificity is really helpful. Fixed costs, 50% to 60% of take-home pay—that includes your rent or mortgage, utilities, any debt payments, cable, groceries, all the fixed stuff. Next category I track is savings, 5% to 10% of take home, although of course I’d love to see more. Next is investments, 5% to 10% of take home—of course I’d love to see more because that’s where real wealth is generated.

And then my last category is my favorite one: guilt-free spending, that’s 20% to 35% of take-home pay. So, you have those four numbers, you can actually sit down solo or with a partner. And you can say, “OK, let’s map it out—this takes us 15 minutes to get 85% of the way there. Let’s decide what do we want to do this year. Do we want to go to this great restaurant? Do we want to take a trip with our family? Do we care about a nice hotel? Oops, that doesn’t fit into our numbers. All right, let’s save a little bit more this year and we can do it next year.”

Benz: One thing that you talk a lot about is the role of time. So, how time relates to money and how people sometimes go through these steps to save money that ends up costing them a lot of time. Can you talk about how you approach that and how you want people to factor their own time into the financial decisions that they might make?

Sethi: I would love it if people stayed awake on a Saturday night researching different savings accounts like I do, but most people actually have a life, so they’re not going to do that. That’s life. That’s why they turn to people like me. And that’s why they come to you for advice as well. The fact of the matter is that I want people to spend less than an hour a month on their personal finances, not just because they’re ignoring it, that would be ineffective. But rather because they have systems set up that are automatically handling their savings, automatically handling their investments, and they even built in a little buffer in case their tire goes flat on their car.

When it comes to making big financial decisions, we are super irrational. I kind of love it honestly. It’s just the human condition. We’ll spend more time looking up what cool restaurant opened up to go out on a Saturday night, than we will researching the actual cost of buying a house. It’s absolutely bonkers. You have people who literally keep a massive Yelp page, or wherever they’re tracking their restaurants, and then you ask them what percentage of gross income is going toward housing. They’re like, what does gross mean? I go, OK, cool. Let’s start at the beginning.

The fact is, I can’t berate people for that because there’s a lot of stuff I don’t know. If you ask me how my car works, I have no idea, I just put the key in and it turns, great, let’s go. So, what I often do is say, let’s get the big things right. Let’s make sure that by default your money is being saved, it’s being invested, and also you feel guilt-free when you go out to eat at a restaurant, you can order dessert. You don’t have to spend a ton of time, but you do have to get the high-leverage items right. Those would be things like buying a house, buying a car, any type of debt that you might be taking out. Get those right and then the price of coffee does not really matter.

Ptak: Some of the people you feature in the show are shouldering heavy levels of debt. How can people in that situation find a rich life even as the process of debt paydown can be kind of a slog. Do you have any hacks that you can share?

Sethi: Jeff, a lot of it is psychological. It’s this idea that it’s overwhelming and I’m never even going to get out from under this. And sometimes just talking to somebody like me, who comes along and says, look you’re going to be OK. I’ve talked to people with $50,000 of debt, I’ve talked to people with $800,000 of debt and we can make a plan. We can get this going. It might take some time, but we can do it. And just hearing somebody say that you’re going to be OK, goes a long way. Interestingly, 90% of the people I talk to who have debt do not know how much debt they owe. Why would they? They don’t want to open those envelopes and those emails, it’s just bad news. And 95% of people with debt who I speak to do not know their debt-payoff date. To me, that’s actually a huge opportunity.

It’s kind of like when I’ve waited in line for In-N-Out, that burger place in California, and it always has a long line, especially if you’re outside in the drive-through. And what they do is something very clever—they have somebody standing outside who takes your order and the minute you give your order you’re still waiting in line for another 20 minutes. But you just feel, they know my order, they’re making it. There’s just this sense of relief. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel. So, I’ll talk to people like Frank on the show, or like others on my podcast, who have $50,000, $100,000, $300,000 even more debt, and we will work through it together. They don’t even know how much they owe. We’ll pull out the papers, we’ll plug them into a calculator and they will see, oh my gosh, in 2041, December, my debt will be paid off. OK, that’s a long time away, but at least they know.

And once we get that win, I give them a high five through the screen or in person. I go, “Great, we know! OK, it’s 20 years. But we know!” Then I go, “Just do me a favor, add $50 a month to that debt, just see. Let’s just see what happens.” And that often shrinks that debt by years, and you can see their eyes go wide. That is the moment they’ve made the connection. The fact that they can take control. They don’t yet understand interest rates and time, value of money. They don’t understand that, nor do they need to at this point—all they need to know is they can see their future on-screen and they can affect it. And that is a powerful moment.

Benz: On the show, you talk about jobs and income in addition to just spending, which I appreciated. Several of the people you featured on the show earned their income in nontraditional ways. A couple of the people were influencer types and another was involved in multilevel marketing, which I learned a little bit about during the show. How do you go about getting people in such roles to be realistic about their earnings potential while not quashing their dreams to pursue whatever sort of career trajectory they’re interested in?

Sethi: Christine, that’s why I get paid the big bucks. You’re right. How do I help them be realistic—because frankly, if you’re going to be an influencer, your kind of delusional anyway—and then also encourage them? That is a very fine line to do. So, there’s a lot of different techniques that I use. Sometimes I’ll say, “How’s it going?” A lot of times they’re just like, “Oh, it’s not going well.” I go, “OK, how long has it not been going well for?” They’re like, “Four years.” I’m like, “Is anything going to change in the next four years?” And no one has really asked them that, and I’m doing it in a nice way. Yes, we’re talking about something kind of depressing, but I’m smiling. I’m like, “You think anything’s going to change? Come on, tell me the truth.” And I think that rapport goes a long way.

Sometimes I will share views that they never actually thought about. For example, if somebody is going to go full time as an influencer, they may not realize that they’re now responsible for certain taxes and withholding, and so on. And they’re going to have variable incomes where they make $20,000 in one month and then nothing for six months. And I might just ask them, “Hey, how would you handle that?” And they their eyes go wide because they realize they never thought about that. Sometimes I have to be extremely straightforward and honest. In the case of the MLM … I really hate MLMs. I just hate them. They are predatory, almost no one who participates in them is successful, and they use a variety of psychological techniques that I find highly unethical. So, I had the opportunity—I was actually shocked, I did not know this before I met her. But I had the opportunity to speak to someone who’s involved in MLM. In fact, I went to an MLM conference.

Benz: Ramit, can you explain what that is, because I had to Google it while I was watching it.

Sethi: Multilevel marketing.

Benz: Yeah.

Sethi: Well, many of us confuse multilevel marketing. There’s a sort of a relation, although we confuse it with a pyramid scheme. But some of us have heard some of these MLM companies, and there’s a variety of different characteristics that MLMs have. Often you will know about them because they are encouraging their friends and family to join and to sell as well. There’s a variety of these things we all probably grew up hearing about these. It’s very tricky because they are right on the border of being illegal, but they’re not, and they have a very strong legal background in my opinion, a lot of these should just be completely outlawed. If you look at the statistics, people involved in MLMs almost never make money, but they are conveniently portrayed as a way to make passive income while working from home, and so on, American dream, blah blah blah.

I had the chance to talk about this on camera with someone who’s involved in an MLM and what was really interesting was that she had actually made quite a bit of money one month and then she had not made that much in a long time. And I know from my background in psychology, same dynamics used in slot machines. That if you win once, you tend to want to go back for variable reinforcement. You love the idea that you might just be winning just that one more slot-pull. And a lot of that is quite unethical. So, it’s my job to help people gently see it, but it’s also my job to recognize that they are going to do what they are going to do. It’s not my life, it’s theirs. I can share my perspective. Sometimes I can tell them point blank, “I would never do this, I think you should stop.” But ultimately I have to do it in a way that allows me to be honest but let them make the decision.

Ptak: Wanted to shift gears and talk about homeownership. You’re sometimes characterized as anti-homeownership. Your position seems more nuanced than that. Can you share your thoughts on homeownership more broadly?

Sethi: The fact that I am considered anti-homeownership because I encourage people to run the numbers on the biggest purchase of their lives, shows you how far the pro-homeownership propaganda runs in this country. It is totally absurd. Let me make my position very clear: I believe that you should run the numbers when you go to buy a house, because sometimes buying a house can be a great financial decision, sometimes renting can be a great financial decision, and sometimes renting can actually be a better financial decision than buying a house. I have rented by choice for about 20 years. I’ve lived in San Francisco, New York, LA. I could buy a house today. And I choose to rent, for a variety of reasons, including lifestyle and financial, and I have made more money renting than I would have owning—a lot more. Why?

Because most of us simply take the bigger number and we subtract the other number and we go, “Granny bought a house in Austin, Texas, in 1970 for $100,000 and Granny just sold it for $1 million, Granny made $900,000.” I go, “Have you ever heard the word inflation? Do you know what that is? How many times did Granny replace her washer and dryer? And how about that concrete in the back? And also, what about the opportunity cost of that down payment? And also, what about her labor time going to Home Depot? You ever considered that?” They go, “No, no, no, but it’s $900,000.” I go, “Pick up a calculator and don’t talk to me until you run the numbers.”

We are blind to running the numbers because in this country we have propaganda: “Owning a home is the best investment you’ll ever make. You’re throwing money away on rent.” Funny, nobody ever said you’re throwing money away at a restaurant. “You’re paying your landlord’s mortgage.” Funny, you never seem to be concerned about paying your sushi restaurant owner’s mortgage. But suddenly we use these almost-religious phrases when it comes to buying a house. Buying a house can be good—you might make money, you might not. You probably are not going to get the numbers right unless you actually run them. Renting can be fine as well. So, I particularly hate when I hear young people feeling guilty and feeling ashamed that they are renting. Never feel guilty for renting it can actually be a fantastic financial decision, but you need to run the numbers.

Benz: One of your rules for homeownership is that people should have a 10-year time horizon in mind for living in the house. Can you walk us through how you arrive at that?

Sethi: If you look at an amortization table, well, first of all, let me just say that I just lost like 98% of people listening right now because the word amortization doesn’t even sound good. No one even knows what that is. They spend more time picking their tile than they do actually typing out the word amortization calculator. So let me just establish, I’m sure everyone just dropped off this podcast. When we go to buy a house, a lot of people, they start throwing around all these words really fervently: “Well I’m building equity.” OK, how much equity are you building? “Well, it’s equity; I’m throwing money away on my rent.” I go, “Have you ever looked at amortization table? Do you know that in the first 10 years you’re basically paying majority interest?” They don’t even know what is interest, what is principal. Again, I’m not blaming anyone, these are complex concepts, but if you’re going to buy a house. You better understand this.

So, in the first 10 years of homeownership—again, depending on location, cost, and so on—you will often find that you are spending more simply paying interest than you are putting toward the principal. And I show this. I posted a video with a calculator and I show people the calculations on my social media. If you leave in the first 10 years and you factor in all the closing costs, all the transaction costs, all the maintenance and new furniture costs, it’s often common that you’ll find you actually lost money. Now this is shocking to people. They go, “What are you talking about? I bought it for $360,000, I sold it for $400,000. I made $40,000.” I go, “OK, show me the $40,000.” “Well, there’s this thing and then we got recurring, I don’t …” You did not make that much when you subtract out all the fees. So, it’s important as some general guidelines to, for example, plan to stay for at least 10 years. If you leave after 9.5, OK fine I’m not going to do anything to you. But the longer you stay, the more that you’ll be able to spread those costs like peanut butter. Spread them out over many years, which starts to make equity buildup actually possible.

Ptak: We wanted to ask you maybe a question or two about investing. You don’t go too deep on investing in the show except to tout index funds and give the basics on asset allocation. But one of the people you profiled had gone down the rabbit hole of trading and was trying to claw his way back to break even. How did you convince him to give up that pursuit?

Sethi: This is a great question because traders are very difficult to persuade to stop. The research shows that most of these traders will lose money over the long term. They hardly ever make money. I see them on Twitter, their username on Twitter has the word trader in it. I’m already like, oh God. And then they start giving me advice on investing. I’m like, why would I take advice from a guy who has the word trader in his username and has a picture of a goat? Trust me, I’m not taking any type of financial or otherwise advice from Mr. Goat over here. The problem is that traders, like gamblers, really believe that success is just around the corner, and sometimes they even taste success. “Oh my God, I bought this one stock and it went up 200%. Oh, that’s so fantastic.” And sometimes they actually sold and made money from it. The problem is that as we know, you cannot do that consistently over the long term. You will lose—even fancy people wearing fancy suits in New York on Wall Street, they lose. So, the simplest thing to do is to accept the research that says low-cost passive investing is going to be the superior investing strategy over the long term.

Issues with that, as I already mentioned, they’ve got the gamblers fallacy. In America we don’t want to be average at anything, even though by definition, most of us are. And so, people go, “I don’t want average; 7% that’s so boring. It’s going to take me a long time to make money.” I go “Oh, God, whatever; I’m not trying to convince you anymore.” So, in Christian’s case on the show, he had actually done quite well through his diversified 401(k). He’d done really well, so I let it cook a little bit. Sometimes I don’t need to make the point right up front. I just let it cook. And we found out on camera that he had lost tens of thousands of dollars, even his wife didn’t know. That was a great moment, by the way. I was like go ahead, talk amongst yourselves. And at the same time, I also asked both of them—they’re a fantastic couple—I said, “What is your rich life? What do you want to do together?” And they told me this beautiful vision—they wanted to build an empire together. They want to retire Christian’s mom. They want to do all these beautiful things. I said, “Great, you can do this. Let’s make it happen. But let’s take a look at what’s going on here.”

And when I raised the stakes for them and I helped them cocreate a vision, then it became clear that some of the dysfunctional financial behaviors they were using were not serving them. But if I had just come in and kicked down the door and said, “Stop picking stocks!” They would have taken one look and said thank you very much, but no thanks. So, my job involves helping people create a vision of a rich life and then often they realize that their own behaviors are not serving them.

Benz: I’d like to get your take on crypto. You had this great metaphor about how the parts of our portfolios are like the different pieces in a wardrobe and you compared the crypto piece to Crocs, quite disparagingly—sort of suggesting you do not need this, this is not going to look good on you. Can you walk us through your thoughts on crypto?

Sethi: Well, I think crypto is a great way if you want to speculate; it’s fantastic, it’s quite volatile. I think that if you have a fully diversified portfolio and you’ve handled everything, it’s all automated and you go, “You know what, I want to take 1% to 5% of my portfolio and have some fun with it.” Fantastic. The problem is that when I talk to these crypto zealots—who, by the way, have all disappeared in the last year and a half—they would go, “I’m all in on crypto.” I go, “Do you have a diversified portfolio?” And they look at me like I’m some old dude and they go, “Diversification, that’s for like boomers.” And I just go, “You are doomed, there’s nothing I can do to help you.” The idea that your investments should become your identity is the beginning of the end. And you see that when you have these jokers with laser eyes on Twitter going around posting all these meme stocks and saying cryptos about fiats over blah blah blah, all these arguments hold no water whatsoever.

Not surprisingly, exhibiting many cult dynamics that I studied in college—inner language, in group, out group, all kinds of stuff. Well, guess what, most of these folks lost a lot of money and they all seemed to vanish. A lot of people who message me, because I’m very open about crypto and the dynamics around it, they all delete their accounts, they’re gone. The ones that stay though, fascinatingly, continue to post about crypto. I’m like, wow, you’ve lost 70% of your money, you just keep posting, like that’s going to work. Keep posting bro, I’m sure it’s all coming back. And again, I don’t mind if people have a little fun with money and investing, once you have a fully diversified portfolio. But what you often find if you really dig deep and I have, I’ve spoken to thousands of crypto—I’m not even calling them investors, they’re speculators—and really one of the chief arguments deep down that they admit is, “If I were to simply adopt a passive investing strategy, it would take me a long time to make money. I’m impatient, I don’t want to wait. Therefore, I’m going all in now, because this is my one chance.” And I simply just reject that premise.

Ptak: You’ve talked about couples and interactions that you’ve had with them about their financial lives at various points during our conversation. So, one perennial debate in the context of couples is whether they should combine everything, maintain separate accounts, or use kind of a hybrid system. The question is, which of those is favorable in your opinion?

Sethi: I’ll tell you my opinion, but I’ll also tell you what I see with couples. My opinion, what I would prefer, is that people use a hybrid system, which is a joint account that covers joint expenses and then separate individual accounts with money that has no questions asked, you like it for massage, you like it for golf, whatever. I don’t always see that, I don’t always see that, and here’s something really interesting I’ve learned about account structures in couples. Many people have joint accounts. Many people do not combine accounts. That alone is not indicative of whether they are going to be successful or not with money. What is much more indicative, is that couples who actually sit down and talk about how they want their money to work together, they tend to set up joint accounts. So, it’s not the joint accounts that make people in relationships successful, it’s the fact they actually sat down and talked about it. And I know this because I speak to couples who sat down, intentionally talked about it, and said, we want to keep separate accounts. And they’re doing great. So, it’s not the accounts per se that determine whether a couple is going to be successful or not; it’s that they are talking about it and talking about it regularly.

Benz: Do you think it’s generational? I remember encountering this separate account thing and I have to say it was kind of alien to me. I assumed everyone who is married did fully combine financials, but do you think it does vary by generation?

Sethi: I do, and I think there’s a variety of reasons for that. Historically, we may have seen, particularly in older couples, that one partner was the primary breadwinner or may have been the only earner in the relationship. Now you’ll see both members of a relationship tending to work. There’s also people are getting married later, which means they’ve become much more established with their accounts. So, there’s a variety of dynamics beyond simply, which bank account are people using. But absolutely, I agree with you, generationally, the younger couples I see are much more likely to have separate accounts or keep separate accounts than the older couples I speak to, who almost overwhelmingly have combined their accounts.

Ptak: You’re also not a big fan of couples fully delegating financial matters to just one partner. Why is that not a great idea? After all, couples delegate household jobs or chores all the time. Why is it not sensible when it comes to financial matters?

Sethi: We do. Every couple has one partner who tends to do certain tasks and another partner who tends to do others, and it might be you empty the dishwasher, I’m taking out the trash. But we don’t delegate certain things. It would be very rare these days to see one partner exclusively handling parenting. That’s just not really how things are done anymore and what that speaks to is that there are certain things in a relationship where one person can handle it. The stakes are relatively low. Oh, wow, you didn’t load the dishwasher correctly, all right, whatever. But when it comes to big, big, big things, like parenting and money, those cannot be delegated. And I’ll tell you in my relationship what happened.

So, if you think about delegation, technically I should probably be the one managing money in our relationship. When we met, I had already been running my business for about 15 years and I’m pretty good at money. I think about it every day because of my business, I know how to invest. But pretty early on, I told my now wife, I said I’d like for us to both be involved in our money and I’ll tell you why. First, I’m going to get hit by a bus one day, something’s going to happen. And the worst thing for me would be to leave you defenseless not knowing where the money is, how it works, or be able to protect you from the inevitable circling sharks. Second, I want us to have a second set of eyes. I don’t want to just be doing this myself. I want us to create a culture of stewardship in our family. We know that we’re going to use money strategically for our own life, for our family and certainly for charity. We got to do this together. And then finally, it’s just a lot more fun. It’s a lot more fun to have a partner, doing it together, especially when you can dream together and that is really the crux of it. When we think of money, we often think of obligations and debt payoffs and bill pay. All that stuff, that’s 1% of it. When I think of money, I think of taking a trip to India to see my family. I think of tipping huge when I go out. I think of a beautiful coat that I can buy. I think of the things that make me happy and will make us happy and that is why delegating just to one person in a relationship, is in my opinion, a very, very unhealthy behavior.

Benz: I want to address couples with varying incomes, unequal levels of income, where one person’s earning a lot more. That happened on a few occasions on the show. So that can create a power imbalance in the relationship. There was one stay-at-home dad, I think you picked up on the fact that there was sort of a power imbalance going on there. Do you have any strategies for resolving the tensions that can arise in that sort of situation?

Sethi: It’s so interesting to watch the power dynamics emerge when it comes to money, and in the case on episode one, you met Matt and Amani. And Matt stayed home, and Amani is quite a high earner. And that’s quite fascinating for a variety of reasons, including that it sort of bends our cultural understanding that for so long in America, people have simply accepted that in a heterosexual relationship he might earn more than she does. But that’s changing. In fact, in major cities, young women in their 20s earn more than young men. And this is something that needs to be talked about because it’s very, very taboo to talk about money and power, money and gender. And I actually love shining a light on these topics. I have an episode 65 on my podcast. There’s a young woman, she has been dating this guy for about a year. And she says to me, “I want him to pick up the check at dinner.” He says, “OK I try to. But when I slide my credit card across the table, she slides it back and says ‘I want you to invest in your Roth IRA.’” OK, interesting.

Then I find out that he recently started a business—he makes $2,000 a month and she makes $200,000 per month. She’s making 100 times what he makes, so here we have power. We have class, we have gender all coming together on episode 64 and 65 of the podcast. And with couples with big divergent incomes, the best thing I do is simply shine a light on this elephant in the room. I say, “How does it feel to earn more?” And you’ll discover some really peculiar things. The lower earner almost always is obsessed with the C word, contributing—”I want to contribute.” If someone’s making 2 times, 3 times, 5 times, 100 times more, it’s probably unlikely that you can financially contribute to the same level. And one of the things I share very candidly with people is that in a relationship, yeah, money is important, but it’s just one small part of a rich life. There are so many other ways that partners can contribute, and so we open that discussion up. We talk about what would it look like, what would make you feel happy, do you feel worried, do you feel ashamed? And what would it take for you both to feel good about money? That’s the starting point.

Ptak: One of the people you work with was paying a financial advisor a percentage of assets every year, in this case 1%. You suggested that she look for an hourly advisor. Why do you think that’s a better model for financial advice?

Sethi: The vast majority of people who are paying 1% have no idea what that means, and that’s exactly how Wall Street has designed it. One percent seems so innocent—oh 1%, no big deal. Little do people know that that will be approximately 28% of their lifetime returns and paying 1% is not the same as hiring somebody to mow your lawn. You would never pay that person a percentage of your portfolio. I got a lot of heat from financial advisors who predictably do not like Ramit Sethi out there saying you shouldn’t pay 1% AUM. And I want to be really clear: I have no problem, paying an advisor an hourly fee, even a hefty hourly fee. I think you should pay for premium advice. I myself have hired a financial advisor to give me a second set of eyes on my own asset allocation. But never AUM—that you do not get better performance, your incentives are not aligned, and worst of all, people genuinely have no idea how much 1% actually cost them.

Benz: Well, Ramit this has been such a terrific discussion. We really appreciate you taking the time out to be with us today.

Christine Benz: Hi, and welcome to The Long View. I'm Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar.

Jeff Ptak: And I'm Jeff Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar Research Services.

Benz: Our guest on the podcast today is financial advisor Lazetta Rainey Braxton. Lazetta is the co-founder and co-CEO of 2050 Wealth Partners, a virtual financial planning and wealth management firm geared toward serving individuals who haven't traditionally been recruited by other financial advisors because of their income, age, race or gender. She has frequently appeared on national television shows, and she's also a member of CNBC's Digital Financial Advisory Council and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal's Experts blog.

Lazetta received her bachelor's degree at the University of Virginia and her MBA at Wake Forest University. She's also a certified financial planner.

Lazetta, welcome to The Long View.

Lazetta Rainey Braxton: Christine, thank you for having me.

Benz: Well, thank you so much for being here. We want to start out by talking about your firm 2050 Wealth Partners. You launched the firm with Rianka Dorsainvil in February of this year. So, was it always the plan for your firm to be digital-only versus a traditional financial-planning setup where you'd see clients in your office?

Braxton: Yes, we designed 2050 Wealth Partners to be 100% virtual. Prior to merging our previous firms, we were virtual as well, too. The key is, access to financial planning and what better way to say that we are available to you regardless of what state you're living in, and we also noticed that living in metropolitan areas, people really have difficulties finding parking and dealing with commuting. So, we really wanted to make the client experience as easy as possible, with minimizing stress factors such as what I just mentioned--commuting, leaving work early. Now that they can meet us in any place in any state, we have satisfied that goal or met that goal of providing financial-planning access.

Ptak: Are you finding that clients are coming to you with different types of concerns these days than they were before the pandemic began?

Braxton: What we're seeing now is people really are allowing themselves to dream even more. With financial planning, we like to say, let's put everything on the table. And we can decide based on what your goals are, your values are, and the trade-offs of what should come off the table and what should be added on. And so, now there's a heightened appreciation for life. With this pandemic, people are thinking about what really matters to them. And we're seeing that they're living into their financial plan. They've been great savers, been very prudent with their finances, and now venturing a little bit more in terms of reshuffling what's important to them, whether it be buying a second home, or investing in a startup, because a lot of innovation happens during crisis and a lot of people don't think about that. But when things are tough, that's when you are most creative oftentimes.

Benz: I've been thinking about this Lazetta: Do you think that the time that we're in, because it's in a lot of ways really stressful for people, is this a good time to be making major financial decisions? On the one hand, people are thinking more expansively about their lives, which is good, but I just am wondering, what's your thought on that question?

Braxton: This is a risk-management question. With unemployment rates being high, excessively high, a lot of uncertainty regarding the markets, it is something to consider about risk mitigation. So, your question, is this the time to do certain activities? It depends. How strong is your balance sheet? Can you handle if, in fact, you have this second home and this second mortgage, and you can't do the Airbnb rental to help subsidize the cash flow that's needed to sustain that property? So, these are the questions we're absolutely asking. And we're running projections as well too, thinking about what if you can't sell that property, how much equity you have in your current home? So, this is not a one size fit all. Once again, I'm going back to our principle of saying what you desire and see if the numbers really support that, along with the economic conditions for which we don't have a crystal ball but we definitely have some indicators that we have to monitor.

Ptak: You used the term ""saying what you desire."" That can be somewhat paradoxical in markets given the fact that we as human beings are sometimes prone to panicking. And what we desire is to get out of the market as soon as we possibly can amid market tumult and the like. And so, I'm curious how you work through that with your clients during the pandemic when they might have been given to panic and try to sell out of their investments? How did you talk to them about that?

Braxton: We do a tier approach when it comes to safety nets, if you will. This sounds very fundamental, rudimentary, but this is how it helps clients feel comfortable about their situation. So, we say, ""OK, what do you like to have in your checking account at all times? What do you like to have in your emergency--or I like to call it a cushion--account?"" When you think about cushion, you think about pillows, helping you sleep at night. There used to be this rule of thumb, or maybe it's still out there, about three to six months or more of a six to 12 months having that just kind of strong cash holding. And then, from there, we say, ""OK, what's in your brokerage account in terms of liquidity; next, knowing that that's subject to the market and then your retirement account.""

So, if our buckets are filled the way that we have decided they should be filled based on those tiers, then people are really not thinking about short-term shocks. Because if there's a short-term shock, they go to their checking account. And then, if that has to be used, then they can go to their cushion account that has to be used, and they go to their brokerage account, then if that has to be used, and you look at other variables--do you need to kind of shake loose some liquidity from assets that are not known to be as liquid, i.e., retirement accounts, because there are penalties with the exception of tax treatments like the Care Act? Do you have to do a home equity line of credit as well? So, when you have that kind of padded security and different tiers, that really helps our clients know that they can do short-term movements, but not a lot of impact to their long-term goals.

Benz: So, one thing you alluded to, Lazetta, is that one of the target clients for your firm is people who are going from being employees to entrepreneurs, but many small businesses are really struggling through this period. Have you found that the pandemic has affected people's willingness to start these businesses? And how do you counsel them on the prudence of doing so right now?

Braxton: There are statistics that say that small firms really don't make it past three years, and many absolutely fail at the five-year mark. So, these are statistics that we keep in mind. Being a small business ourselves, we have been able to identify some actions that really kind of help people know or navigate this terrain of being an entrepreneur. It is definitely not for everyone. You have to have a certain degree of risk that you're willing to take because of the failure rate that is known to be true.

What we found is when you identify, and this is within any business, a need and can articulate that clearly and removing the noise, that really helps. So, what I mean about articulating the vision? Rianka and I both are very committed to access to financial planning. When you read our blogs, when we're on podcasts, such as these, anything that we do, we're homing in the same message and we're also honing in who we serve. And I think what is really, really key that people have to realize is that you are your business. So, if you're true to yourself, and true to who you want to serve, there's a hunger that comes behind that that's almost relentless. And then, you add that to a passion, with a good team in place--those who can kind of help you navigate some of the highs and lows of operating a business, along with a business-cushion account as well when the income is not coming in. Those are some of the factors. And your network as well, too. So, we kind of really do our little checklist about how committed this particular person, do they have a stomach to be an entrepreneur? What they're offering, is there a need and do they have this niche to be able to serve it?

And then, we share with our network. So, with our clients, we do a client newsletter, we create community as well too to get the word out. Because if you're front of mind with people, when that need comes up, you come up as well, too. We help them with social media, which has been extremely important as well, have a strong website, helping with the content. So, we're helping them give birth--imagining give birth and follow along the way. And then, also, we say begin with the end in mind. This is something that I'm fortunate my husband has shared with me, I'm sharing with others as well, too, such that, if you see that that end is not the way that you want it to be or what you thought it would be, be willing to dissolve it. And sometimes it's hard for people to realize that if they gave it their best, and it's not going to work and you need to pivot, then that's what we help them do as well, too. It's time to pivot to something different.

Ptak: One of your goals with your firm is to serve individuals who have traditionally been underserved by the financial-planning community. I think you call it ""financial advice for the rest of us."" What types of clients haven't been courted by traditional financial-planning and investment-management firms?

Braxton: We see a range interestingly enough. So, starting off first with kind of the mass affluent, most firms like to see clients with assets under management of $1 million or more. What we're finding is that there are a lot of individuals across different generations that have high income but haven't built the investable assets outside of their retirement accounts. So, they have significant cash flow and building those assets, so they get disqualified from a lot of the firms who want that AUM to establish a relationship. So, in our case, we're able to generate the fees that pretty much is very close to those who have the assets in the business. We just say, we're turning income into assets. That's been a wonderful niche for us. So, that's one segment.

And then, we have another segment of people who've done all the right things--fully funded their retirement accounts, had their cushion accounts, have this wonderful cash flow and assets, but really haven't been identified as a viable option in terms of treatment. So, whether it is because of their race, their gender, just haven't gotten the attention that they believe that they deserve. We recognize people's humanity. We want them to live their best life. We try to eliminate as many barriers as possible. We're very true about what our values are, what's important to us. We stand firm in those. And so, if that aligns with the client, then it's a win-win. And I would say probably 80% of our clients have never worked with a financial planner before.

The other piece of this is, is that we're anchored in financial planning and advice. We see investments as an integral part, not the starting point. So, for us, we are really anchoring in that person, that human capital, what's important to them. And then, we look at the other areas that help support that: investments, estate planning, tax planning, small-business planning, college planning, whether they want to buy another house or do a 1031 exchange. It's very holistic and it's very community, a deep-relationship oriented. We're in it for the long haul with them.

Benz: A goal for your firm is to serve diverse populations. And you've articulated some of the principles that you bring to bear on how you serve them. But can you talk about how you try to empathize with your clients and really understand them and understand their life experience, their cultural experience? Can you talk about how you try to tap into that?

Braxton: We start out with our name 2050 Wealth Partners. The Census Bureau says by the year 2050, the U.S. will be a mosaic. And we're living into that changing demographic, and we want wealth to go along with it. So, by our name, we're saying very boldly, we're living into the future, and those who want to take that journey along with us, let's do it.

The next thing is that we are women of color. And I say women of color--my heritage is African American; Rianka, my business partner, her heritage is African American and Chilean. So, our own experiences because of our race, geographic location, because of our gender exposure gives us, we believe, a competitive advantage, because there are just not many CFPs--certified financial planners--of color. The statistics for African Americans and Latina is 3.5% or less, even less for African Americans. And then, we haven't seen the statistics on women of color, who have their CFPs, which I'm sure is lower as well, too.

So, in essence, we, unfortunately, are still considered pioneers in this industry, because the numbers are so low. And when I say CFPs--certified financial planners--that number is over 80,000 and growing. So, our cultural differences, our backgrounds from who we are, how we were raised, how we were trained, and then our integration to other firms, majority firms, really makes us versatile and very nimble.

The other aspect of this--I'm a Gen Xer. Rianka is a millennial. So, we have kind of the middle generations, right? She has two generations younger: Gen Z and Gen Alpha. She just had a little one. My daughter is Gen Z. And then, obviously, our parents are baby boomers and silent generation. We have two generations ahead of us, two generations younger than us. So, well-positioned to do intergenerational wealth conversations, which we do as well, too. We're fortunate that our experiences, although very challenging for being one of few, also gives us a competitive advantage.

Ptak: What do you think could be done to promote greater diversity in the planning and financial advice fields?

Braxton: A lot of people have a difficult time combining mind and heart. It's very easy to want to compartmentalize what is business and what is personal. And I'm back to the concept of our humanity, how can you separate those two important pieces of who you are as a person, whether it is you're thinking about this as being the client, or you're thinking about this as being the professional. And then, if we're homing in on the professional and the work environment, people thrive when they feel like they're being valued and appreciated for what they bring to the table. And a lot of times people don't know how to communicate or engage because they haven't been exposed to a lot of different environments, a lot of different conversations. It's very easy to live isolated.

So, when it comes to diversity in the industry, when it's predominantly a white male industry, then it's like, what opportunities have white males or other majorities have in terms of really understanding the needs and opportunities of what is now the minority? So, what does this mean? You have to get out of your comfort zone. You got to care for the well-being of those who don't look like you, haven't been raised in the same context that you've been raised, haven't had the same issues--societal issues that are very much a forefront and have been in this country for several centuries.

The opportunity comes now to say how engaged are you willing to be? What will you expose yourself to that may make you feel uncomfortable, such that you have a better understanding and a better way of interacting and engaging with someone or a population that's different from you? There's some risks there. But since we're talking about investments, just in general, in terms of the conceptual stock market, I'm talking about the investment in human capital, we know that returns don't happen overnight. You got to analyze, you got to engage, you got to assess the risks and what you think that return is. In our mind for our firm, we say the return is keeping up with these trends that say the demographics are changing, that's reality. It's happening sooner rather than later. And if you decide to be late to this investment, just like for those who are late saving for retirement, you got to put a whole lot more in the longer that you wait. So, why not start now? Take the chances, be ahead of the curve, prepare for this next transition that we will see in this country and therefore within our profession.

Benz: What advice do you give to people of color who are considering or embarking on a career in the financial-services industry? What do you think when you reflect on your career so far, what do you think have been the main contributors to your success?

Braxton: If you are a person of color entering this field, know that we are very much aware of the opportunities for growth and expansion of diverse talent and opportunities to include this diverse talent into our firms, into this profession, and creating conditions, hospitality so that this talent feels like that you belong.

Have your community. One of the things that has been very important to me is that I engage many trade associations--the Association of African American Financial Advisors, for which I've had leadership roles in along with NAPFA, which is the fee-only, as well as FPA, the CFP board. Figure out where there are like-minded people who will support you who understand and also give you room to be you. So, keep searching till you find your group. And you can start that large with these associations. And then, you can move to mastermind groups where it's more intimate, more targeted. And keep networking, keep having the conversations and stay true to who you know and what you can provide to this profession.

Realistically speaking too, you need to have a cushion. A lot of people who are coming to this industry as career changers are not ready for the change in salary, because you're kind of starting afresh. It's not apples to apples normally in terms of compensation. For those who are freshly out of college, make sure that the firms that you're going to are really invested in your human capital, will help give you room and time and compensation to be able to study for the exams that you need to be successful in this industry. And also, are willing to compensate you such that you can have a strong foundation. This “eat what you kill,” it is not working anymore. The younger generation are straddled by student loan debt. They made some sacrifices in the human capital, and there's got to be some balance to help absorb them and have a good start as well, too. So, really be intentional with negotiations with your employers, and also read the surveys to see what you should expect in terms of range of compensation. And hopefully, you'll be able to make the transition. Because the first few years are pretty tough if you have to do it on your own.

Ptak: Let's shift gears and talk about how your firm operates. With a typical client, what percentage of your time—ballpark—do you spend on financial-planning matters and what percentage goes to investment management?

Braxton: We design our experience to be consistent among our clients. So, the first year, we lead the first four meetings as really kind of getting to know them, getting them onboarded to technology, doing a data scrub and then delivering their plan. After we've delivered the plan, then we move into implementation. And typically, that starts with investments and then risk management, tax planning. And those areas really could be switched based on the time of the year and the need that it's taken as well, too.

So, once we've kind of gone through building the plan, getting them on board and acclimated to our 2050 Wealth Partners family, delivering their plan--we call it the big picture so they can see it. And oftentimes we say, I know this feels like drinking from a fire hydrant but it's so wonderful to get everything on the table. And then, we'll take deeper dives.

So, within the first year, we've built the plan and started the implementation. And then, the subsequent ongoing years include the ongoing investment-management meetings, the tax-planning updates, the estate planning if it hadn't finished that process as well. That's an area that you don't necessarily change every year. But if you had a baby, if you got married, those types of things. So, our ongoing calendar gives us the opportunity to look at each area of the plan to see if there's any updates that's needed. And if there's something that has happened throughout the year, the clients know that they can schedule with us at any time.

So, we have a rhythm with our clients. In terms of percentages, as you can tell from how I've just explained it to you--first year, we set the foundation; the ongoing years, we intentionally have quarters for which we focus on certain areas; we meet with the client at minimum two to three times a year, thereafter the first year, more, if necessary. All done virtually.

Benz: Could you ballpark that breakdown between what percentage is financial planning and what percentage is investment management?

Braxton: It's hard to segment investments versus financial planning, because investment planning is a part of our financial-planning schedule.

Benz: True.

Braxton: I'll tell you the strategy that we take. So, when you think about investments, we have the core that we're looking at that is totally index, passive investing. And then, from there, we look at alpha from human capital. So, that's negotiations, you know, making sure that human capital, they're getting what they deserve, moving along in their career, or helping them build a business. And then, we also see real estate as a part of that portfolio as well, too. And so, when you're thinking about us for investments, because we are planning for them for the long term, and we're doing an index, passive investment approach, maybe 30%, with taking an index passive, we're keeping up with the markets, but we're not picking stock. So, if we were more active managers, obviously, there would be more time. But our active management is human capital, real estate, and then their investments as well, too, which we take a passive index approach.

Ptak: One demographic that your firm aims to serve is the so-called sandwich generation. People are simultaneously raising children while also attempting to look after aging parents. What are some of the common predicaments that people face at this life stage? And how do you help people navigate them?

Braxton: We like to call the sandwich generation also the wealth protectors. When you have generations that are older than you and younger than you who need resources for support, wealth can be a little bit elusive. So, what we try to do, and this is so important for sandwich generations and families in general is, one, put on your mask first, know what you need as a household for economic stability and security. And then, there you can know how much you have available to support the generations ahead of you or generations that's coming behind you.

For instance, the generation ahead, sometimes our clients actually pay for long-term-care insurance for their parents. Their parents can't afford it. But it's a hedge of protection for that, say, Gen X, who has a baby boomer or a silent generation parent. So, that's a strategy--we're looking at cash flow, maybe they need to make that investment in long-term care, such that if they didn't have this policy, then that could be more exposure for their cash flow and their assets as well, too.

Now, thinking about a Gen Xer from the standpoint of a generation that's younger, or two, as you're preparing for college. So, what we do is we think about college. And plus, because we don't know how college trends would change now with virtual learning, as well as this student loan bubble, instead of putting all your college savings in a 529, maybe we say, let's do 529s, let's do Roth IRAs, because you can take out those contributions. We're looking at different funding sources, such that if the child doesn't need the funds for college, these funds that were earmarked for college, there's no penalty, or they can be pivoted and used for other uses. For instance, that Roth IRA is saving for retirement, but it can be used for education, vice versa, that type of thing.

So, we are looking at ways to mitigate wealth leakage, if you will, assessing from the standpoint of strength from that sandwich generation, and then also saying what can be done and what's available to support these generations that need resources to be able to live a comfortable life. And then, we're back to trade-offs and setting boundaries as well, too. It's easy out of just your heart to want to give away the resources that is not in a measured way, in a planning way. And we say to them, if you're not stable, then this really breaks the chain across all generations.

Benz: That's such an interesting point, Lazetta. Jeff and I had a great conversation with Michelle Singletary, where she articulated some of the same points and made the point to us that in her life, in her experience, helping family members is kind of like table stakes. It's what you do if you have family members who need help. So, how do you help your clients? Like assuming your clients are financially well. How do you help them put boundaries around their own financial well-being, while simultaneously helping them deal with that need, that impulse to help family members in need?

Braxton: All of our clients go through what we call--what we like to call it--a money rhythm; we like things to be in sync. So, money rhythm, most people call it a budget or spending plan. We also like to call it a lifestyle plan. We just say put everything that you spend core--expenses, itemize those. And the core expenses could even be a Netflix service, because that's something that you're going to pay for every month. So, what are your core? And then what's your discretionary? Your food, gas--maybe not so discretionary--but you're not paying for an automatic draft out of your account every month. And once we kind of get their lifestyle plan--so let's say your core, plus your discretionary, is $10,000 a month net.

From there, we say OK, if you’re bringing in $12,000, that leaves $2,000 left to satisfy your goals. So, what are your goals? We want them to have a certain amount in your checking account, we want a certain amount in your cushion account. If you want a down payment on the home, or whatever the case may be, or you want to care for parents. So, we just say let's put all the goals on the table. And so, then we start prioritizing what the goals are. So, I'm OK with the checking account cushion, I need to get to six months. This is what I currently have. And so, we just take this $2,000 and we divvy it up. And we figure out how to divvy it up based on the goals. So, if parental support or college savings or paying for the daughter's wedding, if that's on the table, then we say OK, when is that time frame? So, if it's college, we know that's x amount of years. If it's parents, they're doing fine now, maybe we plan for when they turn 80, if that's available, or even if you want something to give to them each month to pay for this policy, long-term care. Then we bake that in and to the money that is available. And if we realize there's not a lot of money that is available for certain goals, then we're back to the trade-offs.

So, when they really see kind of the lifestyle plan, they can make the choice if they want to make any adjustments with their lifestyle plan--what they said they want to live comfortably on. And we don't do any judgments when we're looking at the lifestyle plan starting off; we just say, just get it all on the document, just itemize it all. We don't say what you should and shouldn't do. See what's left over and then you can go back and revisit that. But I anchor everything in their best interest first. And I help them see that they are the party--if they're stable, then everybody else wins. If they're not, everybody else loses along with them.

Benz: What are you encountering with your clients' willingness to pay for financial advice in general? We're in the midst of a period of high unemployment and economic stress, and even households that haven't experienced job loss may be looking for places to tighten their belt. So, what kind of pushback, if any, are you getting from clients or prospective clients about paying for financial advice at this juncture.

Braxton: I'm back to the ""clearer you are about who you are."" And this is as a firm as well, you give people the option to see if you are the right fit for them. And if they are the right fit for you. We believe in transparency as well, too. So, on our website, we clearly say what our starter annual retainer fee is based on your household status, and if you're an entrepreneur, as a starting point. When we send the link for prospective clients to set up their initial call, they have to check a box to say that they have read our fees, read our website and noted our fees, because we believe in doing due diligence for investments, and they should do the same as well too. So, once they come to us, they have a good feel of who we are and how much we charge. So, it's a self-selection process. And if our fees don't accommodate or we feel like it's not a good fit for other reasons, then we have a network for which we suggest other colleagues, other firms that may be a better fit. So, we don't get any pushback at all on fees whatsoever. And we send our invoices that they pay so they know exactly whether it's through assets under management, because there is a component that we do AUM, above $400,000. And then everybody else is retainer, if they are retainer, they have the option. So, they know exactly what they're paying, when they're paying, how much they're paying. So that's not an issue for us.

Ptak: What was the thinking behind that fee setup?

Braxton: The thinking behind that the fee setup, arrangement. Yes. So the kind of standard $1 million, 1%, that's $10,000. So that's kind of the high-net-worth establishment. And we looked at the income that we're seeing for our clients, and really tested it out with the market. So, usually we're no more than about 2% to 3% of income. And when you think about income, that's pretty much a low percentage. And our clients have been OK with that amount. We've looked at leveraging, how we leverage technology in our human capital, too, to make sure that we continue to be a profitable and growing business as well. We just found a sweet spot. And we'll continue to kind of test the market and see how these rates will continue to be the same or grow accordingly. The other aspect of this is, we capture with our financial plans and our updates, the value that we've delivered. So, it's never a question of how they've gotten their money worth. Because we're very meticulous with our notes. We're very meticulous with our plans, not to overwhelm them in any way, just bullet points, and just touch points. So that they know that we're not just waiting for the market to change to have a conversation; we're actually engaged in their lives, and it's worth the money that we've saved them in terms of sleeping at night, making good decisions, and staying on track.

Benz: You mentioned that you have a network of advisors that you refer prospective clients who say this is more than I want to pay. What type of advisors would those be? Would they be hourly? What sort of business models do you like for really small investors?

Braxton: For small investors, I've done a lot of pro bono work through the Financial Planning Association for many years when I was based in Maryland. And I had the opportunity to really understand the organizations that provided free financial literacy. And then now there's this groundswell of financial coaches, as well. And then you have, just like you said, those who are financial planners who have different service models. We, as a prime example, had people on our waitlist. And when Rianka was on maternity leave, we said, we're not taking on new clients. We had people that signed up, not waitlist, on a priority list. And we kind of went through--we looked at their income level, what they were experiencing with their debt, what their objectives were based on the survey. And we said, based on this criteria, your income, your debt level, you might want to consider this accredited consumer debt counseling service, or you might want to consider a financial coach or you might want to consider this particular program that a person helps you to stabilize your debt and get going in investments and that type of thing. So, we are very in tune to the wealth spectrum. And also know that going to your question that we may not be the right fit, but when people say they're ready to live a better life based on their money and their finances. We want to be of service to them, even if we're not their financial planner.

Ptak: Shifting over to the advice profession… What advice do you give to people of color who are considering or embarking on a new career in the financial-services industry? What have been the main contributors to your success?

Braxton: Getting very involved, like I said, in trade associations, Financial Planning Association, Association of African American Financial Advisors, which is very dear to me, NAPFA as well. The CFP Board has some initiatives, and time is our currency. So, you have to be careful about how much time that you are investing in these organizations and whether you're looking at it from a service perspective or service and a volunteer perspective--the volunteers giving back to the profession. This is where you will meet like-minded people. So, for instance, NAPFA, and I'll also add XYPN as well--they are fee-only. XYPN focuses on Generation X and Y, NAPFA has been around longer. And I'm involved in all these organizations, all of them because there are different aspects of me that actually I enjoy different engagements, whether it's a fee-only advisor or advisor firm predominantly of color or just a broad spectrum, like FPA has different models as well, too. So it's really good to have--we used to say rolodex, I don't know what we're saying now--in your contacts of people that you can say, ""Hey, I see you on FPA Connect or Quad-A's LinkedIn page, and I just have some questions to ask."" Or ""Can you be a good dialogue partner?"" Or ""Do you know about any study groups?"" It's really, really important to, like I said, find the people who you best identify with, who will invest in you, and you and them as you continue to grow in this profession. And then study, study, study, study, compensation models, study business models, figure out what licenses you need based on the segment you want to serve.

Make sure that you know your craft, inside and out, and people who are aligned in the same way that you are and how you want to provide your service as well, too. And then enough of us do not look at other industries and how they're servicing. We, within our industry, a lot of us want to mirror another financial-planning firm’s practice with no creativity and no innovation. And what we're seeing, even with technology, is that technology firms are coming in and then adapting technology to financial planning. So we, within our profession, need to really study other service models to see if there are ways that we can better deliver and communicate financial advice in a way that really engages people, because money is a difficult topic that really needs a lot of care, a lot of energy, and just good vibes, if you will, that it will be important for us to figure out creative ways to keep clients engaged in the future.

Benz: Our last question for you is for people who are just starting out in their financial lives, younger people, are there any resources that you recommend again and again, whether books or websites, any go-to resources that you find yourself recommending?

Braxton: One, a lot of people hear Mint.com, and it's free, but YNAB, You Need a Budget--it's a great tool as well to just track how you're spending--your lifestyle plan. So, there's one aspect about knowing what's coming in and what's going out. And that's even for those who, like my teenage daughter, who likes succulent plants and interior designing her room as a 15-year-old. We have to monitor and we set up her bank accounts, we've given her a budget of how much we are allotting to her for household spending for her to learn basic money management, just what's coming in, what's going out, how do you prioritize.

Another element for young money managers, and now investors, is we also, as an example, for our 15-year-old some years ago, set up a stockpile account. We gave her investment money to say, what companies do you like and what you follow. So, my daughter likes watching Netflix. So, she invested in Netflix. It’s done very well for her in these partial shares that she's invested in with her stock app. And I get to see what she wants to invest in and approve. So, I'm getting her exposed to money management; I'm getting her exposed to being a stock investor. And then I'm also getting her exposed to debt management. She is an authorized user on our credit card. When we see the statement of things that she can charge within her budget, she has to transfer money to our account for what she has spent that is outside of our allotted allowance. We're getting her exposed to money management, how to invest in stocks, stock market, and then we're also going to expose her to debt management as well too. And she's 15. We started with her when she was 8, when she started learning math and wanted to buy expensive dolls. And we're like, you may want to think about it. One doll costs $100. How many 20s are in $100 bill doing basic math, and she's like there are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100: five. And then we go to another store to say that same doll that you kind of like is not the same, but it costs a lot less. You only have to spend one 20 and still have four left.

For young investors exposure with some coaching allows them to take small risks, but they're measured with not huge loss, with some guidance to give them the financial confidence that when they're on their own, they've already had some great practice.

Editor’s note: Read the latest on how the coronavirus is rattling the markets and what investors can do to navigate it.

On April 20, U.S. oil prices dipped into negative territory and Brent crude swooned shortly after. The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on worldwide consumption of gasoline and other crude products, and the supply response thus far has been lethargic and ineffective. As a result, storage utilization is dangerously high, and investors who paid heavily to escape short-term crude futures may yet breathe a sigh of relief. Even before the latest oil collapse, the outlook was bleak: The 9 million barrel/day decrease in global demand that we now forecast due to COVID-19 eclipses prior downturns, and brinksmanship by Russia and Saudi Arabia has delayed a crucial response on the supply side. But extrapolating Armageddon oil prices to infinity is a mistake. We think the GDP impact of COVID-19 will be modest in the long run. Once a vaccine is developed, we see little reason for demand for most oil-related items (even for air travel) not to fully return to normal. If the intensity of consumption is not severely affected, we will eventually see strong catch-up demand, which cannot be satisfied without a contribution from U.S. shale--and that business model simply does not work at strip prices. The marginal cost for shale producers is $55/barrel (West Texas Intermediate), and without a recovery to that level, shale investment will fall far short of what's necessary.

Long-Run Oil Demand Will Be Nearly Unscathed by Covid-19, Paving the Way for Evidential Recovery

Storage Fears Send Crude Tumbling WTI crude spiraled into negative territory on April 20 as oil traders played a high-stakes game of musical chairs. Widespread social distancing due to the coronavirus has dragged down oil consumption, and storage utilization at the Cushing hub, where delivery of the WTI contract occurs, is rapidly climbing. Storage utilization has been sharply rising for the United States overall in recent weeks, due chiefly to the dearth of oil demand because of COVID-19. However, utilization in Cushing has surged the most, going from 50% in early March to 72% by April 10. If this rate of increase continues, Cushing's tanks will be full by mid-May. Practical limits could be reached much earlier than that, given that utilization never rose above 90% in the prior oil downturn in 2016.

That makes front-month futures contracts much riskier than usual--nobody wants to take physical delivery if there’s nowhere to store it. In the April 20 scramble, some investors paid as much as $40 per barrel to offload futures for May delivery because if Cushing does get full, it could cost even more to find an alternative home for physical barrels at the time of delivery. The price of the front-month WTI contract (for delivery in May), which expired April 21, fell from $20/bbl to negative $38/bbl over the course of the trading day. Near-term Brent prices subsequently declined as well, suggesting global storage utilization is mirroring the U.S. But because Brent futures are cash-settled, the declines were less severe.

The significance of the declines was probably overblown by intense media coverage, given that longer-dated futures were affected much less severely. The WTI June contract has fallen from $26/bbl on April 17 to $17/bbl (35%), indicating moderate concerns about near-term storage, but it has stayed out of negative territory so far. The December 2020 contract has fallen only about 14%, and the 2021 average strip price is down about 9%. These are all significant declines, but far from catastrophic. In our view, any physical constraints will evaporate once OPEC cuts kick in and COVID-19 isolation ends. So, it doesn’t make sense to discount long-term prices for storage risk.

2020 Set for Historic Demand Decline, but With a Quick Bounce Back We now expect a 10 mmb/d impact from COVID-19 on global oil demand in 2020. Subtracting this impact from our pre-COVID forecast (about 1.2 mmb/d growth) yields our new forecast for an almost 9 mmb/d (9%) oil demand decline in 2020.

This is a stunning hit to demand by historical standards, easily surpassing the 1.6% decline in the prior recession (2007-09). No one-year decline in oil demand in the post-WWII era comes close, although we did see a 10% cumulative demand decline from 1979 to 1983 in response to the oil price shock of the late 1970s. While this forecast might seem sensationally bearish, we think it’s very much realistic (and roughly in line with leading-edge consensus--the International Energy Agency’s newly released April oil market report projects a 9.3 mmb/d demand decline in 2020).

Our oil demand forecasts draw on Morningstar's macroeconomic work, which incorporates the impact of COVID-19. We forecast a 1.4% fall in global real GDP in 2020, incorporating a 460-basis-point impact from COVID-19 (compared with our pre-COVID-19 expectation of 3.2%). Typically, oil demand growth has about a 1-to-1 relationship with GDP growth. However, given the disproportionate hit to transportation from COVID-19, we're expecting a much greater hit to oil demand than overall GDP in 2020.

However, we still don’t think it’s time for investors to panic on oil demand. Crucially, we believe that oil demand will see dramatic catch-up growth in 2021 and afterward. That’s because we forecast a modest long-run impact on the global economy from COVID-19, which implies a V-shaped recovery in GDP. We don’t think that the ensuing COVID-19 recession fits the mold of a 2008-style recession that has longer-lasting economic impact, as the world’s productive capacity will be largely untouched by the virus, and economic confidence should rebound quickly once the virus subsides.

We expect jet fuel and gasoline (8% and 26% of global oil demand, respectively) to drive over 70% of the hit to 2020 oil demand. These products are driven mostly by passenger transportation, which will be curtailed for social distancing. Likewise, we expect the second quarter to drive about half of the 2020 impact, as that is when social distancing will probably crest.

Our forecasts are informed by our month-by-month projections for COVID-19 outbreak severity in the U.S. and implementation of mitigation measures including business closures and voluntary social distancing. In our base case, we expect the need for social distancing to fall dramatically in the second half of 2020, as we project a much lower fatality rate thanks to the development of effective drug treatments. While we developed this model for the U.S., it is a good guide for what to expect for the rest of the world on average.

In percentage terms, we think jet fuel will take the biggest hit in 2020 (37% impact). In recent weeks, airlines have discussed cutting near-term capacity by 40%-70%. Drawing on early data from various sources, Rystad Energy projects a 60% hit to second-quarter demand, in line with our view. While we expect much of life to return to normal in the second half of 2020, we still think people will reduce travel and avoid most large events. Given the close contact with masses of people from dispersed areas that air travel entails, we think it will lag the sharper recovery for gasoline demand.

We don’t think demand for diesel or other oil products (primarily petrochemicals, industrial fuel, and marine fuel) will be hit any harder than GDP, as demand for these oil products is primarily driven by demand for goods. Unlike typical global recessions, which have hit investment expenditure and durable goods consumption much harder than services consumption, this recession will be focused more on services, given the need for social distancing.

Although we think gasoline will take a smaller hit (16%) than jet fuel, its large share of global oil demand (26%) means that it is the single-biggest driver of our forecast impact to 2020 oil demand.

We calculate the expected impact on U.S. gasoline demand by breaking out U.S. passenger vehicle miles by trip purpose. We project an 18% impact to traveling for work and school, which accounts for 34% of miles driven. We estimate that roughly 30% of U.S. workers are office workers who are highly eligible to work from home. We assume that these workers reduce their commuting by 80% in the second quarter and one third for the second half of 2020 on average. For the remaining 70% of U.S. workers, we expect substantial reductions in commuting only to the extent that businesses are closed, which we think will occur mainly in the second quarter. We assume a 30% impact from these workers in the second quarter and 5% of workers in the second half.

Likewise, for shopping we expect a rough second quarter followed by a second-half 2020 rebound. Our forecast for a 12% hit to shopping miles slightly surpasses our projected 11% hit to retail sales thanks to e-commerce substitution.

Meanwhile, we think recreation and other trips, which includes restaurants, will be hit hardest; although we expect restaurant closures to largely abate after the second quarter, we think longer-distance travel for vacations will remain somewhat subdued even in the second half of 2020.

Altogether, this analysis indicates a 17% impact to U.S. gasoline demand, which we use as our estimate for the OECD countries broadly. For non-OECD countries, we expect a marginally smaller impact (15%), as we think travel in middle- and lower-income countries is less discretionary, and we expect a smaller GDP impact for these countries as well.

How Quickly Will Things Return to Normal? We expect a relatively V-shaped recovery for oil demand, in line with our views for economic growth. We expect some lingering impact in 2021 as a vaccine probably won't be available until midway through the year, but nevertheless the bulk of the lost demand should be recovered by 2021. That's in line with the rapid demand recovery we project for the second half of 2020. Morningstar forecasts a nearly complete recovery in GDP from the COVID-19 impact, with just a 0.9% impact to the long-term trend of real GDP. Therefore, oil demand should likewise recover nearly to its pre-COVID 19 trend, assuming that the oil intensity of GDP isn't affected by the crisis.

Could there be any lasting damage to the oil intensity of GDP? Once a vaccine is developed, we see little reason for demand for most oil-related items (even for air travel) not to fully return to normal. One possible factor is that the crisis could create a permanent boost to working from home. According to a recent Gartner survey, 74% of surveyed CFOs thought that at least 5% of workers previously working in company offices will become full-time work-from-home employees after the COVID-19 crisis ends. CFOs cited the cost benefits of working remotely, and about 20% mentioned plans to cut back on real estate expenses. That said, the cost-cutting impetus could subside once the economic downturn passes. Also, 5% of large-company office workers account for probably less than 1% of the U.S. workforce; this select group could well have transitioned to working from home in the next several years anyway.

We think it’s also possible that the abrupt shift to working from home in 2020 may be less than fully functional for some companies, which could sour employers’ long-run assessment of it. Indeed, one of the leading academic proponents of working from home is pessimistic about the COVID-19 work-from-home experiment, citing especially the negative effect on productivity of having children at home (due to closed schools). In addition, many workers have plunged into a less-than-ideal setup in terms of home office space, desk ergonomics, and audiovisual equipment.

One somewhat analogous historical episode is the temporary surge of female labor mobilization during WWII and its impact on long-term female labor force participation. U.S. female labor force participation increased from about 28% in 1940 to 34% in 1945 in order to fill the gap left by military mobilization of U.S. males. However, female participation fell back to 30% by 1947 and ended the decade at 33%, an increase of 500 basis points, which was roughly in line with the long-term trend beginning in 1930. In this example, an exceptional change in labor market patterns during a crisis had at most a modest impact on long-run trends in the labor market.

Our Long-Term Oil-Price Forecast Is Unchanged Our equity valuations incorporate strip pricing for the first two years of our forecasts, and currently the strip is indicating a very weak next two years for oil prices, with prices averaging about $28/bbl WTI, or 50% below the 2019 average of $57/bbl.

We agree with the market’s pessimism on near-term oil prices, as oil will be in severe oversupply due to the 9 mmb/d drop in demand that we now anticipate. We assume about 5.25 mmb/d in combined production cuts from OPEC and Russia for 2020, which will drive global oil supply lower by about 5 mmb/d for the year--insufficient to fully offset the lost demand. This imbalance implies a 4.1 mmb/d inventory build in 2020, or 1.5 billion barrels for the full year. This easily surpasses the 0.8 billion barrels implied inventory build during the 2014-16 oil bust.

After OPEC, the fastest responder among major oil suppliers is generally U.S. shale, but even U.S. shale can’t react to lower oil prices overnight. We forecast a 43% year-over-year drop in the U.S. light tight oil rig count in 2020, and we think drilled but uncompleted deferrals will amount to about 10% of shale oil wells drilled. This will slow U.S. oil supply growth to zero in full-year 2020 (with U.S. supply down almost 1 mmb/d comparing the fourth quarter of 2020 with the fourth quarter of 2019). However, this doesn’t fully offset the demand drop.

Oil markets should considerably tighten after 2021, thanks to the robust demand recovery coupled with slowing supply from U.S. shale and other areas. Upstream companies are aggressively cutting capital spending this year, which will eventually damp their output. Unless producers are willing to start investing in growth again, we think the current glut could transition fairly quickly into a shortage. But the required increase in activity won’t happen without higher oil prices. The U.S. shale industry is still the marginal producer in our global framework, and that business model doesn’t work if prices dip sustainably below our $55/bbl midcycle forecast.

After 2020, we expect the U.S. to contribute more in rebalancing global oil supply with demand, which should placate both OPEC and Russia. In 2021, we expect OPEC and Russia’s oil production to rebound to a combined 44.5 mmb/d, or 2.5 mmb/d below 2019 levels. Meanwhile, we expect U.S. supply to fall to 16.1 mmb/d in 2021 from 17.2 mmb/d in 2019. This is a rapid shift for the U.S., given its prior growth trend (1.5 mmb/d average growth over 2017-19). For comparison, U.S. production actually grew by 0.75 mmb/d over 2014-16 despite the oil price downturn.

The much faster shift in U.S. production this time around is driven by a much faster reaction by U.S. shale producers, which have already cut the U.S. horizontal rig count by 32% since March 13. By contrast, during the 2014-16 downturn, the rig count wasn’t reduced this much until March 2015, even though oil prices had already fallen 50% by the end of 2014.

Unlike the 1980s, We Don't Expect OPEC Support to Collapse Given the massive hit to oil demand in conjunction with concerns about OPEC supply restraint, some have understandably drawn comparisons to the 1980s, a disastrous decade for oil markets. Real oil prices fell 46% from 1980 to 1985 despite steep OPEC cuts, due to vicious declines in oil demand. Then in 1986, the bottom fell out, as support for ever-deeper OPEC cuts eroded. OPEC production increased 13% in 1986, and oil prices collapsed another 48%. Altogether, it took oil markets two decades to recover from the hit to the demand and loss in OPEC coordination--oil prices didn't recover to 1985 prices in real terms ($56/bbl WTI in constant 2018 dollars) until 2005.

However, we don’t think this historical episode is a good guide for today. First, the hit to oil demand in the early 1980s was a permanent shock to demand. To a great degree, this was a delayed reaction by oil consumers to the ramp-up in oil prices in the late 1970s. Higher prices led to permanent shifts in behavior and improvements in fuel efficiency, which took several years to play out. By 1980, oil demand was almost 30% below the pre-1980 trend. By contrast, the massive decrease in oil demand in 2020 is (in our view) a mostly temporary response to COVID-19, which should reverse after the outbreak subsides.

Given the magnitude and permanency of the demand collapse, OPEC faced a nearly impossible task in the early 1980s in propping up oil prices. Within OPEC itself, cooperation was showing signs of fraying even before 1986, with the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, and Venezuela only cutting an average 20% in 1985 versus 1978 levels (versus over 50% for Saudi, Kuwait, and Iran).

Return of U.S. Production Growth Will Require Robust Activity Recovery We project that the U.S. supply will need to return to growth after 2021 in order to balance global supply and demand. World oil supply grew an average 1.2 mmb/d in 2017 through 2019, while the U.S. grew an astounding 1.5 mmb/d over that period. Not only did the U.S. account for all incremental global supply needs, but it made up for substantial production declines from other producers, notably Iran and Venezuela.

However, we forecast substantial activity declines in 2020 in response to lower oil prices, commensurate with the deep capital expenditure cuts by exploration and production companies that have been announced so far. This activity decline will put the brakes on U.S. shale production growth. If the U.S. shale growth engine is to restart (which we expect will need to happen by late 2021), that will require much higher activity and spending, which in turn will necessitate higher oil prices.

We project that the U.S. light tight oil rig count will recover to about 620 by 2023, which we see as its sustainable, long-run equilibrium level. This is about in line with average 2019 levels, when oil prices averaged $57/bbl (close to our $55/bbl long-run oil price forecast). This will allow for the U.S. to account for about 1 mmb/d in average annual supply growth over 2022-25, about in line with the growth in global oil supply.

Looked at from another angle, we still think the long-run break-even cost of U.S. shale is $55/bbl. Historically, U.S. shale production has contracted when oil prices have been below this level and grown rampantly when prices have been above it.

We see little reason to change this long-term expectation. In the short run, temporarily low activity will probably push service pricing below our long-term expectations. However, the activity rebound we anticipate through 2023 will reverse these short-term savings. Moreover, pricing was already quite weak in 2019 for many U.S. shale oil service markets. Service companies in many U.S. shale markets, including pressure pumping and land drilling, were earning returns on capital far below cost of capital. It’s unlikely that pricing could remain sustainably lower than we saw in that year.

What about the potential for efficiency gains to lower break-even costs? We had already anticipated this occurring in the next several years in the U.S. shale space, including about a 15% reduction in drilling days per horizontal well. U.S. shale operators were already prioritizing high-efficiency development before this year’s downturn; we don’t think operators will be able to (sustainably) eke out even more efficiency gains in response to the lower prices. The low-hanging fruit is gone.

U.S. E&P: Don't Underestimate Ability to Endure Weak Prices Upstream stocks have already been kicked from pillar to post in the last couple of years, and commodity prices were only partly to blame. The S&P Exploration and Production Select Index lost 60% of its value between October 2018 and February 2020, even though WTI crude lost only 30%. A variety of issues have reduced investor appetite for E&Ps, including the fear that gasoline will soon become obsolete (a longer-term story, in our view) and the risk that a left-leaning U.S. presidential candidate would torpedo the shale industry with a fracking ban (a less urgent threat now that those candidates have dropped out, and something the industry can probably compromise on if it continues working to minimize emissions through reduced flaring and more efficient fuel consumption). But the biggest issue holding many investors back has been the perceived failure of these companies to live within cash flows year after year and the constant reliance on external funding.

There’s no doubt that capital efficiency was historically poor among shale companies, but we have long been sympathetic to the argument that learning by doing takes time. Drilling hundreds of wells generates constant feedback, enabling companies to optimize their processes through trial and error, and there’s strong evidence that most companies have dramatically lowered their production costs as a result. But the recent performance of the stocks shows that investor patience has clearly worn thin, and by dragging down crude prices, the coronavirus has further delayed the pivot to profitability.

Nevertheless, by sustaining those efficiency gains and scaling back growth ambitions, most E&P companies we cover should be able to tolerate the Armageddon crude prices we now expect this year. For many companies, we expect leverage ratios will rise dramatically, but that’s based on slumping earnings rather than spiraling debt. By acting quickly to slash dividends and dial back capital spending this year to the bare minimum, and after factoring in hedge protection (covering 30%-40% of expected volumes in many cases), all but four companies in our coverage group will outspend cash flows by less than 20% this year.

Living within cash flows probably isn’t good enough in this environment, though, which will probably choke off access to external capital for most U.S. E&Ps. So those with long-term debt maturing in the next couple of years will struggle to refinance. To play it safe, investors should assume that any maturing senior notes are a call on liquidity and will need to be covered with cash or bank credit. And be careful with the latter: E&P credit facilities are often asset-backed, and the capacity is redetermined semiannually based on the value of crude oil reserves (which in turn depends on crude prices). Restrictive covenants can also limit access to committed capital. Either way, bank credit can dry up just as it is most needed, making us wary of companies that will need to rely heavily on their revolvers.

The good news is that very few companies in our E&P coverage will need to load up on bank debt, even after paying off expiring senior notes. EOG Resources EOG, Occidental Petroleum OXY, and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD all face large maturities before the end of 2021, but they also have large cash war chests to fall back on. Range Resources RRC has substantial near-term debt to contend with, but it also has a cash reserve and is expecting to sell mineral rights to shore up its balance sheet further (although it could take a haircut if forced to sell before the market recovers).

The company most likely to run into liquidity issues is Antero Resources AR. Though Antero is a natural gas producer, it also outputs natural gas liquids, giving it exposure to crude prices (on the plus side, natural gas and Antero shares have both rallied on recent oil weakness, as less competing associated gas is now expected from oil plays). Antero is caught between a rock and a hard place, as it has overcontracted its midstream takeaway capacity and is paying an extra $0.15 per thousand cubic feet in marketing costs as a result. That makes it difficult to cut capital spending, as this would postpone the swing to profitability that we expect when it grows into its committed volumes. In the meantime, it is burning cash and has about $1 billion debt coming due in 2021. Like Range, another natural gas producer with meaningful NGL exposure, it will probably use asset sales to bridge the funding gap but could end up selling the family silver at bargain prices in this commodity environment.

In addition, Antero and Range could come close to tripping the restrictive covenants associated with their revolving credit facilities. Both are required to maintain EBITDAX/interest expense ratios of at least 2.5 times, and refreshing our models to incorporate our updated views on near-term commodity prices brings these companies close to the covenant thresholds. There’s some wiggle room--for instance, Range’s credit agreement specifies EBITDAX to cash interest only, and there may be scope to capitalize a portion of its interest to improve this ratio. But in general, we’d steer clear of companies getting close to covenant limits whether they break them or not.

On the oil side, Laredo Petroleum LPI is most at risk. The company does have a very strong hedge position, with essentially all of its expected production locked in at $45/bbl or better this year. But only a third of next year’s volumes are similarly protected, driving up net debt/EBITDA and potentially busting the 4.5 times ceiling in Laredo’s credit agreement. The good news is that it has already refinanced its long-term debt commitments this year, leaving it with no maturities before 2025.

Top Picks in U.S. E&P The marginal cost for the wider group is around $55/bbl (WTI). If prices stay well below that threshold indefinitely, shale activity will remain at a skeleton level and U.S. production will rapidly decline, turning the current glut into a shortage within a couple of years. So, we remain confident that a recovery is inevitable. But the market seems to be extrapolating weak prices to infinity, making most energy stocks look cheap.

For safety, we like EOG and Pioneer. The caveat is that to benefit from higher prices a few years down the line, these companies have to remain a going concern in the meantime. So, we recommend prioritizing the balance sheet above all else in this environment. EOG and Pioneer both entered this crisis period with very low financial leverage, coupled with the ability to generate sustainable excess returns on invested capital. Though both have substantial debt maturities in the next couple of years, they also have large cash reserves and shouldn’t need to rely on bank borrowing.

The best-in-class operators are Diamondback Energy FANG and Continental Resources CLR. Diamondback started 2020 with modest financial leverage and has only $400 million in debt coming due before the end of 2021 (leaving it in a good spot, with more than half of its available bank credit unused). Continental does not typically hedge and is therefore more exposed to the downturn than most peers. At strip prices, it will exit 2021 with net debt/EBITDAX at an uncomfortable 4 times. But it has no debt maturing in the next two years, and we still expect very little outspending, keeping debt/capital below 50% (well below its covenant ceiling of 65%). So, neither company is under immediate pressure financially, even at Armageddon crude prices, and both have stellar records for keeping production costs at the bare minimum relative to peers.

It may be surprising that we’ve highlighted only a handful of companies with potential liquidity issues, given current oil prices. But our coverage is strongly tilted to the higher end of the quality spectrum. Among public E&Ps, the companies we follow tend to be larger, with more economies of scale, better access to credit, more technical know-how, and in some cases better acreage. As such, these companies have stronger balance sheets and rank higher on profitability metrics. While we wouldn’t rule out widespread restructuring and bankruptcies across the sector during this very difficult period, we think most of our coverage will emerge unscathed.

Oilfield-Services Stocks Look Cheap as Investors Have Written Off Capex Recovery Since mid-February, oilfield-services stocks have crashed, with the OSX down around 60%. This caps off a terrible two years for oilfield services, with the OSX down 80% since mid-2018 as a whole. The sell-off has left the industry incredibly cheap, as our average covered name trades at a 60% discount to our fair value estimate. Also, we think our covered names have the balance sheet strength to withstand atrocious oil markets in the next two years.

Before the coronavirus-related sell-off, oilfield-services stocks already looked undervalued to us, as we think the market was underrating long-run oil and gas capital expenditure growth. We’ve believed a good deal of the spending cuts on the international side since 2014 are unsustainable, as (unlike in the U.S. shale space) the cuts haven’t been accompanied by proportionate savings in unit development costs. Additionally, costs for many international producers have been trending up for decades. These arguments remain in place in the long run, even with weaker oil demand in the near term due to COVID-19. To be sure, we expect a rough next two years for oilfield services. We project a 24% cumulative capital expenditure decline through 2021 as producers respond to lower oil prices by throttling back their spending. North America will see the greatest cuts (down 44% in 2020) as fast-moving, price-sensitive U.S. shale producers have already cut rigs over 30% in the past month. However, we think these near-term spending cuts will have to be reversed, as we’re not expecting substantial long-term effects on oil supply/demand from COVID-19. Moreover, we forecast that capital spending by 2024 will be up 15% from 2019 levels, marking a more than full recovery from this year’s COVID-19 disruption.

For oilfield-services companies to benefit from our forecast capital expenditure recovery, they’ll have to survive the next two years. This won’t be easy, given that we expect spending to fall 18% below the prior 2016 trough, when many companies struggled. However, we think the companies we cover should be able to evade financial distress. Our coverage is drawn largely from the higher-quality end of the spectrum; we wouldn’t be surprised if several oilfield-services bankruptcies occur outside of our coverage. In any case, our coverage is well placed thanks to minimal debt maturities in the next two years, which will be easily covered by cash balances and revolver availability. We still project that several companies will generate substantial free cash flow, even in this extreme commodity environment, which will add to available cash. Weatherford International WFTLF is the only company for which we expect substantial negative free cash flow in the next two years, but this should be easily covered by its cash balances.

Given that near-term debt maturities are covered, the other main area of potential concern is debt covenants. Only Core Laboratories CLB has covenants on current borrowings (although a few others have covenants on undrawn revolvers). We’re slightly worried about Core Lab’s 2.5 times maximum leverage ratio on its revolver (on which it has about $150 million in outstanding borrowings). Given Core Lab’s very strong record of profitability (and we think it will remain free cash flow positive), we think there’s a good chance lenders would give it a break if the covenant is breached. If not, however, Core Lab would probably have to make a large dilutive equity issuance to fix the covenant breach.

Integrated Oils' Yields Still High, but Dividends Largely Safe When we looked at the safety of integrated oils' dividends in mid-March, the average yield for the group was 12%. Today, the average yield has fallen to 9%, yet capital spending cuts have materially improved break-even oil prices for the group, although they remain below current oil prices. Despite the drop in yields, they remain well above historical levels and in some cases are above 10%. Furthermore, the group continues to trade at a price/fair value of 0.55 compared with 0.45 in mid-March, demonstrating that ample value still exists.

As expected, most integrated oils announced reductions to capital spending plans for 2020. However, the magnitude of reductions, 20%-30% from original guidance, was greater than we expected. Typically, integrated oils have limited capacity in the near term to adjust spending plans, given the longer construction times and size of their projects. However, the sharp reductions in spending demonstrate the group has learned its lesson from the last downcycle (2014-16) and incorporated more flexibility into their plans, largely through greater investment in short-cycle projects like onshore unconventional and brownfield offshore development. As a result of these capital spending reductions, 2020 break-even levels have fallen.

Despite the improvement, break-even levels remain above expected 2020 average oil prices. That is why balance sheet capacity remains critical to ensuring dividend safety, as Equinor’s EQNR recent decision to reduce its dividend demonstrates. Equinor’s net debt/capital ratio of 28.5% places it the higher end of the range. Other companies, like BP BP and Shell RDS.A/RDS.B, have similarly high debt loads as Equinor, with year-end 2019 net debt/capital ratios of 31% and 27%, respectively. However, both have much larger downstream operations that, though they are also experiencing difficult market conditions, help cushion the blow of lower upstream revenue. Their management teams are also more likely to defend the current dividend with the introduction of a scrip option, given its importance to each company’s shareholder base. In contrast, Equinor is a more upstream-oriented company that does not have the same perception as a dividend play.

That said, we see a higher probability for Repsol REP, which has a history of reducing the dividend, to do so again, given its high debt load (year-end 2019 net debt/capital of 32%). Eni E also has a history of reducing its dividend, but its leverage levels are much more reasonable at 20% net debt/capital. For Chevron CVX, ExxonMobil XOM, and Total TOT, which have net debt/capital ratios below 21%, we see the dividend as safe as well.

Of the group, Chevron has the safest dividend thanks to its low leverage levels and strong free cash flow generation. Total stands out for its dividend safety among Europeans. Chevron’s superior dividend safety appears largely priced into the stock, which trades at the narrowest discount to our fair value estimate among the group.

For those investors looking for value, we recommend Shell, as its yield is not indicative of its dividend safety, in our opinion. It also trades at one of the widest discounts to our fair value estimate. For investors with longer holding periods, we’d suggest Exxon. Even before the recent fall in oil prices, it had been underperforming, as the market was skeptical of its increased investment in growth that stood in contrast to peers. However, while its countercyclical strategy will reduce free cash flow in the near term, it could ultimately prove prescient if current reductions in investment result in supply shortages and higher prices five years from now.

U.S. Midstream: Focus on Quality in Challenging Environment Broadly, we think the industry can muddle through this environment, ultimately by focusing on protecting the balance sheet and generating excess cash flow (operating cash flow minus distributions/dividends minus capital spending). The focus on liquidity is important because we now expect Permian oil supply to decline, following a wave of rig releases by exploration and production companies. For instance, we expect Diamondback, one of the basin's top producers, to deliver essentially flat production this year and a decline of 15% in 2021. While fee-based contracts are now the norm in midstream, instead of commodity-based, they are exposed to volume declines. We also expect a focus on the balance sheet, since most of our coverage has leverage above 4 times, exposing the space to both higher debt costs and liquidity challenges for the weakest players.

High-quality companies such as Enterprise Products Partners EPD, Magellan Midstream Partners MMP, Plains All American Pipeline PAA, Cheniere Energy LNG, and Cheniere Energy Partners CQP remain well positioned. Similarly, gas-focused names such as Energy Transfer ET and Kinder Morgan KMI should do well. Williams WMB will need to proactively address its maturity issues, given its lack of excess cash flow, but the resilience of its operations should provide a buffer. Companies with substantial oil storage operations, such as Plains, Enterprise Products Partners, and Magellan, should benefit amid extremely high demand for oil storage. On the negative side, we think some entities, including MPLX MPLX, DCP Midstream DCP, Energy Transfer, and Oneok OKE, are under substantial pressure by investors to reduce payouts to more aggressively address high leverage or other business priorities. We think the payouts are financially supportable, given our expectations around business results and the entities’ balance sheets, but this environment is offering management sharply higher returns elsewhere, particularly around repurchasing highly discounted debt.

Canadian Energy: Market Pricing Enbridge Like Oil Will Remain Weak Forever Canada's energy sector has been hit as hard as any by the historic crash in oil prices. Earlier this year, the industry was on the verge of rapid expansion as oil sands producers have found a way to generate significant free cash flow with oil prices near $50/bbl. But with the average oil sands supply cost (excluding transportation) near $20/bbl, producers are now rapidly burning cash. As such, we expect a meaningful reduction in the country's crude supply over the next two years, with supply falling from 5.6 mmb/d in 2019 to 4.4 mmb/d by 2021.

Our top pick among Canadian energy stocks is Enbridge ENB/ENB which operates oil and natural gas pipelines. The downturn in oil prices and the expectation of lower Canadian crude supply has renewed fears over Enbridge's ability to generate sustainable, long-term cash flows and maintain stable dividends because of the potential loss of throughput on the company's Mainline system. In our view, the market underappreciates Canada's long-term supply growth opportunities and Enbridge's cash flow generation potential.

We think that investors are mistakenly worried about underutilization of the Mainline pipeline system due to production cuts and the construction of competing pipeline expansions. Even if the Keystone XL and TransMountain Expansion are placed into service (our base case), we expect only minor underutilization of the Mainline until Canadian crude supply ramps up to our forecast levels once crude prices normalize to our $55/bbl WTI midcycle forecast. Accordingly, we expect all the major pipeline expansions to be operating near full capacity within the next decade, fueled by our above-consensus outlook for Canadian crude production.

Even with the Mainline operating at reduced levels, we expect enough cash flow to cover the company’s coveted dividend. Contrary to popular belief, the Mainline isn’t the only driver of profitability and cash flow generation. Almost 75% of Enbridge’s 2019 adjusted EBITDA was generated from its other assets that are underpinned by secured contracts. Because of this, the dividend looks safe over the next decade.

Many people assume a budget is a cut-and-dry, one-size-fits-all regimen. In reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. There are dozens of different budgeting techniques that suit a variety of tastes. Here are some of the most popular options.

01

The Traditional Budget

 PETER DAZELEY / GETTY IMAGES

The traditional budget is the one that comes to most peoples' minds first. You list your income, list your expenses, and find the difference. (Hopefully, you're earning more than you're spending.)

After that, you set goals for how much you want to spend in each category, such as groceries, gas, and entertainment.

This can be a great budgeting technique for people who are detail-oriented and who have more time. It's not so great for people who are ""big-picture"" thinkers, creative types, and busy people.

The 50/30/20 Budget

The 50/30/20 budget is a simplified plan in which you break down your expenses into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

50 percent of your take-home pay should go towards needs, 30 percent should be devoted to wants, and 20 percent should get put into savings.

Dividing needs from wants can be tricky. ""Needs"" include your only vital necessities. You might think that groceries are a need, but there are items that are ""wants."" For example, the fruits and vegetables you buy at the store are a need, while the Oreo cookies you buy at the store are a ""want.""

Lumping them together under the broad umbrella of ""groceries"" causes you to co-mingle ""needs"" and ""wants.""

03
of 05
The 80/20 Budget

The 80/20 Budget is even more simple than the 50/30/20. Under this strategy, you simply skim your savings off the top, and then freely spend the rest.

Twenty percent is the minimum you should save. You should put at least 10-15 percent away for retirement. You can use the rest for emergencies, buying your next car in cash, home repairs, and other long-term savings goals.

You can also modify this into the 70/30 budget, 60/40 budget, or even the 50/50 budget, depending on how aggressively you choose to save.

The beauty of this budget is that once your savings are cared for, you don't need to worry about where the rest of your money is going. This is also known as the Pay Yourself First budgeting method.

04
of 05
The Sub-Savings Accounts Method

Here's a spin on the 80/20 budget: you can decide how much money you need to save by funneling your money into sub-savings accounts based on your goals.

You open multiple savings accounts and give each one a nickname based on specific goals, like ""Paris vacation"" and ""future car repairs."" Then you set a goal ($2,000 for the Paris trip by next January; $800 for future car repairs by this March) and divide the dollars by the timeline to see how much you should save each month.

Now you can auto-draft money each month from your checking account into your multiple savings accounts. Once you're done, freely spend the rest.

05

Budgeting Tools & Apps

This isn't a budgeting ""method,"" but it's worth mentioning. Many people, particularly those who want to create a more traditional line-item budget, use software, tools, and apps to automate their financial tracking.

Programs like Personal Capital, You Need a Budget, and Mint can help you track your spending within a variety of categories. You won't have to maintain a paper-and-pencil ledger.

THE BALANCE

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to allocate your budget according to three categories: needs, wants, and financial goals. It’s not a hard-and-fast rule but rather a rough guideline to help you build a financially sound budget. 

To better understand how to apply the rule, we’ll look at its background, how it works, and its limitations, and we'll go through an example. In other words, we’ll show you how and why to set up a budget using the 50/30/20 rule of thumb yourself.

Key Takeaways
The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a guideline for allocating your budget accordingly: 50% to “needs,” 30% to “wants,” and 20% to your financial goals. 
The rule was popularized in a book by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.
Your percentages may need to be adjusted based on your personal circumstances.
It’s only a rule for how to plan your budget; it doesn’t actually track your budget for you.
What Is the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb?

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a set of easy guidelines for how to plan your budget. Using them, you allocate your after-tax income to the following categories.

50% to Needs

Needs are what you can’t live without, or at least not very easily. They include things like:

Rent
Groceries
Utilities, such as electricity, water, and sewer service
30% to Wants 

Wants are what you desire but don’t actually need to survive. They might include:

Hobbies
Vacations
Dining out
Digital and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu
20% to Financial Goals

This category covers two main areas:

All savings, such as retirement contributions, saving for a house, and setting money aside in a 529 college savings plan (note that contributions to a 401(k) come from your pre-tax income)
Debt payments

Because this is just a guideline for planning your budget, you’ll need to supplement it with something to monitor spending, such as a budget tracker like YNAB (You Need a Budget), Mint, or Quicken. You can then set the 50/30/20 percentages as targets within whichever budget tracker you prefer.

Where Does the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb Come From?

The 50/30/20 rule was popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren (a Harvard law professor when she coined the term) and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, in the book ""All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan."" It was designed as a rough rule of thumb for working-class families to plan their spending to prepare for the future and unforeseen circumstances.

How to Use the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb for Budgeting

Most people save too little and unknowingly spend too much. The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to become aware of your financial habits and limit overspending and under-saving. By spending less on the things that don’t matter that much to you, you can save more for the things that do.

Here’s how it works:

Calculate your monthly income: Add up how much you receive in your bank account each month. If you have a workplace retirement plan, find out how much is withheld, and add that amount back in with your take-home pay. If you pay estimated taxes, reduce your monthly income amount accordingly.
Calculate a spending threshold for each category: Multiply your take-home pay by 0.50 (for needs), 0.30 (for wants), and 0.20 (for financial goals) to see how much you should ideally spend in each category. 
Plan your budget around these numbers: Think of these three categories as “buckets” that you can fill with monthly expenses. List and tally your monthly expenses under the category that each falls into and see whether you’re spending less than the monthly targets you established in the prior step.
Follow your budget: Track your expenses each month, and make changes where needed, to stick to your spending thresholds going forward.
An Example of the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb

Here’s an example using the steps above:

Calculate your monthly income: Let’s say you and your spouse have a total of $4,787 deposited into your bank account each month from your jobs. You both check your pay stubs and see that a total of $532 was taken out for 401(k) contributions. This means that together, your monthly income is $5,319 ($4,787 + $532).
Calculate a spending threshold for each category: Based on the 50/30/20 rule, the amount you should allocate to “needs” is $2,659 ($5,319 x 0.50). The amount you should allocate to “wants” is $1,596 ($5,319 x 0.30). The amount you should allocate to financial goals is $1,064 ($5,319 x 0.20). Since you’ve already contributed $532 to your 401(k)s, use the remaining $532 to pay down debt or save for other financial goals. 
Plan your budget around these numbers: Go through your budget to either plan out your spending or see how well it is already aligned with these targets. 
Total Monthly Income	$5,319
Needs: $5,319 x 0.50	$2,659
Wants: $5,319 x 0.30	$1,596
Goals: $5,319 x 0.20	$1,064
Why the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb Generally Works

Figuring out your finances is confusing, and it’s often hard to know where to start. That’s one reason the 50/30/20 rule of thumb works so well: It’s an easy way to get a handle on something that can otherwise be intimidating.

Even if you don’t take it any further by tracking how well you stick to these targets, it’s still a good way to take your financial pulse.

Grain of Salt

Like any rule of thumb, it’s a good idea to take the 50/30/20 rule of thumb with a grain of salt.

Potential for Gray Areas

It’s sometimes hard to sort out your spending according to three categories. Everyone needs to eat, for example, but some groceries fall into the wants category (like sugary sodas and unhealthy snacks). 

Can Be Difficult for Low-Income People

If you’re earning just enough to make ends meet, you may struggle to save 20% of your income regardless of how you live, especially if you’re supporting a family. 

Savings Might Not Be Enough

On the flip side, if you have big goals, like retiring early or buying a house in a high-income area, 20% might not be enough. 

For example, the average home price of a house in San Francisco was about $1.3 million in June 2024.1 You would need to save, on average, $260,000 to afford a 20% down payment there.

You Still Need to Track Your Budget

The 50/30/20 budget rule is only one piece of the budgeting puzzle. It’s good to shoot for these percentages, but unless you track your spending, you’ll never know whether you’re actually hitting them. 

The 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb vs. Other Budgeting Methods

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb isn’t the only game in town. Here are a few other budgeting techniques that might work better for you:

The 80/20 Rule: With this method, you immediately set aside 20% of your income for savings. The other 80% is yours to spend on whatever you want, with no tracking involved. 
The 70/20/10 Rule: This rule is similar to the 50/30/20 rule of thumb, but you instead parse out your budget as follows: 70% to living expenses, 20% to debt payments, and 10% to savings.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How does tithing figure into the 50/30/20 rule?

As with any rule of thumb, you'll need to adjust it to fit your specific circumstance. When it comes to tithing or any other religious expense, individuals can decide for themselves whether that's something they ""want"" or ""need.""

Where does credit card debt go in the 50/30/20 rule?

Paying down debt is considered a financial goal. That means you should allocate 20% of your budget toward some combination of paying down debt and saving for the future.

How much of your paycheck should you spend with the 50/30/20 rule?

The 50/30/20 rule doesn't specify how much of each paycheck you should spend. The percentage of your paycheck that you spend or save largely depends on the 20% financial goal category. If your main financial goal is to reduce debt, you'll be spending more of your paycheck on that. If your main financial goal is to save up an emergency fund, then you'll be saving more of your paycheck.

Budgeting is a crucial step toward a healthy financial life. It allows you to look at your monthly income and create a clear action plan of what you will do with your money before you spend it. Whether you’re planning to pay down debt, save for retirement, or tame your spending on groceries every month, budgeting can help you achieve your financial goals faster.

Key Takeaways
Budgeting gives you control over where your money is going.
Choosing the right budgeting strategy can help you achieve financial goals.
Creating wiggle room makes it easier to stick to your budget.
Prioritizing savings can provide better financial stability.
Know Your Income

All budgeting starts with knowing your monthly after-tax income, also known as your “take-home” pay. Getting a complete picture of where your money comes from will help you create the foundation for setting your spending and savings goals. Begin by identifying how much money you can expect to bring into your household each month.

Income may come from multiple sources, including your regular paycheck, a side hustle, child support, or government benefits. You can calculate total monthly income by listing each source of income, then writing down the minimum amount each one will bring in after taxes.

Note

If you are self-employed, you may have inconsistent income. Consider using your earnings from the lowest income-earning month you’ve had in the last two years as the baseline amount when setting up your monthly budget.

Choose Your Budgeting Strategy

Budgeting can feel like an overwhelming task for some people. But keep in mind that the best budgeting method is the one that works for you. “There are many great ways to budget, but each plays to different skill sets and financial goals. So don't feel like you have to conform to a strict method,” Kari Lorz, a Certified Financial Education Instructor (CFEI) and founder of Money for the Mamas, told The Balance in an email interview.

50/30/20 Budgeting

If you’re looking for a simple budgeting method,  the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy may be worth a try. It works by splitting your monthly income into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

TAKE-HOME PAY	BUDGET CATEGORY	TYPE OF EXPENSE
50%	Needs	Mortgage/rent, food, utilities, transportation
30% 	Wants 	Eating out, shopping, vacations, entertainment
20% 	Savings 	Emergency fund, debt payoff, retirement
Zero-Based Budgeting

If you want to know where every dollar you earn is going, you may like zero-based budgeting. It lets you control your spending by determining where every dollar goes before you spend it.

Note

Zero-based budgeting is not about spending your money until you have nothing left. It means allocating your money toward your expenses and goals so that if you have money left after expenses, you’re intentional about dedicating it to a goal like debt payment or savings.

Categorize your expenses and figure out exactly how much you’re going to spend in each category and on what. You’ll probably want to first allocate funds to food, housing, utilities, transportation, debt repayment, and other essentials.

Next, you might allocate a certain amount to building your emergency fund or contributing to a savings account for a new home. What’s left may go to entertainment, travel, or other fun expenses. At the end of each month, you’ll get a chance to redo your budget and change anything you need to.

Cash Envelope

The cash envelope strategy works well for people who prefer a more concrete, hands-on budgeting system to help get spending under control.

This technique involves labeling envelopes based on your budget categories—for example, groceries, utilities, and transportation. You then separate actual cash into each envelope. Once the money is gone, that’s all you can spend on that item for the month. This method can create an acute awareness of where your money is going, making it much harder to overspend.

Note

There are envelope budgeting apps you can use for electronic funds and credit or debit card payments if you don’t want to use cash to pay for everything.

Give Yourself a Margin

Always trying to keep track of every dime you spend can feel tedious. So setting aside a certain amount of money to be your margin of error every month is a way of creating breathing room in your budget. “A margin is the secret sauce for maintaining a monthly budget and achieving your financial goals,” Damian Dunn, Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and Vice President of Advice with Your Money Line, told The Balance in an email interview.

However, make sure you’re still financially responsible. You can add a little flexibility into your budget, but keep track of your spending so you don’t go over the margin you’ve given yourself.

How To Create a Margin

The key to creating a margin is to identify how much of your income you don’t need to spend each month. That’s your buffer, or margin. “A margin allows us to absorb the unexpected things that pop up every month without needing to resort to credit or raiding the emergency fund. Ideally, I love to see budgets with 5% to 10% of margin,” said Dunn.

Dunn knows your margin is affected by life circumstances, “But once you've got a margin, fight like crazy to keep it.” In other words, don’t let lifestyle creep eat away at that buffer.

Pay Yourself First

When trying to budget a host of expenses, finding money to save sometimes seems impossible. Try budgeting for your savings before anything else and paying your bills with what’s left after you’ve planned for your savings. This is often called “paying yourself first.”

To do this, set up automated savings contributions so you can save money before you start spending your paycheck.

“Automated savings contributions help create an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach. I would argue that it’s difficult to ever get ahead when you don’t make your savings a priority in your life,” Lorrie Delk Walker, a financial advisor with Allen & Company in Lakeland, Florida, told The Balance in an email.

Use a Budgeting App

When you need extra help staying on top of your spending, a budgeting app can help you track your money right from the palm of your hand. The right app for you is one whose features and costs best suit your financial needs. A few popular choices include:

Mint by Intuit: This is a free tool that links all your accounts, categorizes your transactions automatically, helps you set up budgets, and tracks your spending.
You Need a Budget (YNAB): This app uses the zero-based budgeting system. You can also link your accounts, manage spending, pay down debt, and save. It is a paid service that offers a free trial.
Pocket Guard: Helps you optimize spending, link your accounts, and save automatically. The basic version is free.
Track Your Progress

At its core, budgeting is simply a spending plan. Keep track of your spending to see what’s working, where you’re struggling, and where your money is going. In the beginning, it may help to track your spending on a daily or weekly basis, and assess your budgeting method every month or so. Once you’ve settled on a method you think works, you can make assessments after longer intervals.

“Tracking progress and making adjustments is critical,” Jeff Grampp, CFF and director at Gateway Investor Relations, told The Balance in an email interview. “The costs of things change over time, as do consumption habits. So every year or so, take time to reassess where you're at and gauge the accuracy of your budget.""


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is budgeting?

Budgeting is the process of making a consistent and intentional plan for your money. Make sure your budget works for you. If you feel limited by your budget, it may be time to change it. Make sure your budget includes some fun goals or splurges. That way, you’re more likely to stick with it.

Why is budgeting important?

Budgeting is important because it makes sure you have enough money to cover your expenses and that you’re intentional about what you do with the rest of your money. It helps you pay close attention to your spending, savings, and general financial health. When you create a plan and set goals, it’s easier for you to control your finances and make informed decisions about your spending. It’s also easier for you to identify financial risks and opportunities.

What are some common budgeting mistakes?

Sticking to a budget can be tricky, and  being restrictive doesn’t help. If your  budget doesn’t have any margin for error or you’re too hard on yourself, you might get so frustrated that you give up on your budget. You should also make sure to track your spending, set money aside for an emergency fund, and review your budget regularly to make sure it’s up-to-date.

DEFINITION

The debt snowball strategy helps you pay off your debts by tackling the smallest balances first and building momentum toward the larger ones.

Key Takeaways
The debt snowball strategy helps you pay off debt by focusing on your smallest balance before moving in order to the larger ones.
You'll always pay minimums on all debts, but put any extra money toward your smallest debt first.
It won't save you as much in interest as the debt avalanche method, but it can help you stay motivated.
If you need extra help managing your debt, visit with a nonprofit credit counseling agency (or explore debt settlement as a last resort).
What Is the Debt Snowball Strategy?

The debt snowball method works by building a snowball-like momentum as you gradually pay off debts. To do this, pay off the smallest debt first and move on to the next-smallest debt. Then, continue through the rest of your loans with the same approach. 

During the process, continue making the required minimum payments on all of your loans, putting any extra money each month toward the smallest loan balance. Dave Ramsey originally popularized this method, and since then, many people have used it to successfully pay off their debts.

Note

If you feel overwhelmed by debt, a debt snowball strategy can help you regain a sense of control while paying off credit cards and loans. Other strategies, like the debt avalanche, can minimize interest costs, but the debt snowball method works well when motivation is critical.

How the Debt Snowball Method Works

Setting up the debt snowball strategy is simple and involves just a few steps.

Get organized: Make a list of all of your debts. Order them from the smallest balance at the top of the list to the largest at the bottom. As you build your list, ignore the interest rates, monthly payment amounts, and other loan features. Focus only on the balance.
Pay the minimums: If you don’t pay the minimum required on all of your loans and credit cards, you may have to pay fees and penalties, and it may damage your credit score.
Pay extra on your smallest balance: Each month, put any extra money available toward the credit card or loan at the top of your list. Your goal is to aggressively pay off that smallest balance first.
Build on your success: After paying off your smallest balance, cross it off the list and move on to the next-smallest balance. Take everything you were paying toward the smallest loan and apply that to the next one, on top of the minimum payment you were already making. As you finish paying each debt, your total payment toward the next one will grow larger and larger.1
Note

Mobile apps are a great tool for using and tracking the snowball method.

The Debt Snowball in Action

Assume you have several loans outstanding. Your budget shows that you have an additional $100 available each month for extra loan payments. You can put that $100 to work and pay off debt by using the debt snowball strategy. 

 Start by listing each loan or credit card debt from the smallest loan balance to the largest.

Debt Snowball Example
Type	Balance	Rate	Minimum Payment
Personal loan	$2,000	7%	$39.60
Private student loan	$13,000	5%	$183.74
Credit card	$16,000	17%	$480.00
Auto loan	$21,559	4.75%	$404.38

With the debt snowball, your extra $100 per month goes toward your personal loan first. As a result, you pay $139.60 (the required $39.60 plus the additional $100) to that lender each month. Continue paying the minimum on your other three loans.

 After you pay off each loan, that loan’s payment becomes available for additional debt payments. 

After paying off your personal loan, you now have $139.60 extra for the next loan (because you don’t have minimum payments to make to your personal loan lender anymore). 
You can send extra money each month to your student loan servicer. The payment will be the required $183.74 plus $139.60, for a total of $323.34.
After paying off your student loan, you have an additional $323.34 available each month for paying off your credit card.
The process continues to build momentum until you finally wipe out all of your debts.
Note

See the example above and create your own repayment plan in our debt snowball calculator.

Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche

The debt snowball differs from another popular debt repayment strategy—the debt avalanche. The avalanche method, also known as debt stacking, prioritizes debts with the highest interest rate (instead of the smallest loan balance). It lowers your total interest costs and will make you debt-free faster, but it may not give you those quick wins to stay motivated.

In the example above, you would prioritize the credit card instead of the personal loan because of the credit card’s rate. But paying down that $16,000 balance could take a long time, and you risk becoming discouraged. A debt snowball provides a sense of accomplishment early in the process, and you may appreciate that positive reinforcement.1

Should I Use the Debt Snowball Method?

The debt snowball is an excellent debt elimination strategy. If you enjoy positive reinforcement in small victories and don't have a lot of high-interest debt, it could be a good option for you. 

The snowball method isn’t right for everyone, though. In some cases, it might not make sense to accelerate your payments on certain debts. For example, if you’re pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness for federal student loans, the Department of Education might allow you to stop paying after 120 qualifying payments.2 If successful, the remainder of your debt will be forgiven, so there isn't much benefit to paying extra. Instead of paying extra on those loans, it may be best to pay as little as possible under income-driven repayment and put extra money toward other high-interest-rate debts. 

Whichever strategy you choose, it's important to find the one that you feel you'll be able to stick to until all your debts are paid. The avalanche, for example, won't save you money if you end up stopping halfway.

Note

When you have loans with high interest rates, it might make sense to focus on those first. Lower-rate loans don’t put a significant drain on your finances, and you can pay those off later.

What to Do If You Need Help

While the debt snowball helps you eliminate debt when you have extra income, sometimes you need additional help. Several options are available.

Credit Counseling

Credit counseling agencies are nonprofit organizations that provide education and assistance with debt. You can discuss your situation with a professional, and if necessary, the agency can help you establish a debt management plan (DMP). When using a DMP, you may be able to lower your monthly payments and interest rates, making it easier to manage your loans.

Debt Settlement

Debt settlement is another option, and is considered a more extreme solution. Debt relief companies help individuals manage their outstanding debts by negotiation or consolidation of balances. The service will work out a payment plan, or even help individuals file for bankruptcy in exchange for a fee. Creditors need to agree to the deal, though, and lenders might not be willing to accept your offer. 

Debt settlement can also hurt your credit score, so it’s best to exhaust all of the alternatives before going down this road.3

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How does the debt snowball work?

The debt snowball method pays off your smallest debts first. Then, it rolls the money you were paying toward your paid-off debt to the next balance you want to pay off. As you pay off a balances, you have more money to pay off the next balance.

Is it better to snowball or avalanche?

The best repayment strategy really has to do with what you're most comfortable with. If you don't need the motivation of paying off balances, then the avalanche method might work best for you. However, if you need inspiration from paying off balances to keep you focused, then the snowball method may be the right choice.

DEFINITION
A debt repayment plan is a strategic series of steps you take to pay off your outstanding debts.

If you’ve ever gone to college or bought a car or home, it’s likely you’ve taken on some type of debt. While debt isn’t always a bad thing, too much debt can leave you struggling to pay your bills every month. And if you take on high-interest credit card debt, you could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest.

That’s why it’s a good idea to come up with a debt repayment plan. A debt repayment plan will help you repay your debt over time and gain more control over your financial future. 

Definition and Example of a Debt Repayment Plan

A debt repayment plan is a strategic series of steps you take to pay off your outstanding debts. It’s a plan you put in place to eliminate your debt and get your finances back on track. 

A good debt repayment plan will help you manage your payments and ensure you stay motivated. It’ll also help you cut down on interest charges and avoid falling behind. For example, you may come up with a goal to pay off your debt in three years, and from there, you decide to figure out how you can get there by paying off $400 each month. Your plan might include specific strategies for lowering your interest costs or increasing your income so you can meet your goal.

How a Debt Repayment Plan Works 

A debt repayment plan is a structure you put into place to help you pay off your outstanding debts. You’ll take specific steps to lower your monthly bills and pay down your debt. 

The plan that’s right for you will depend on your financial situation and preferences. Regardless of what steps you choose to take, a good debt repayment plan should include the following elements.

Account For All Outstanding Debt

The first step you’ll take is to account for all your outstanding debt. Create a spreadsheet and list your debts in order of size or interest rate. Knowing how much you owe, what your monthly payments are, and how much you’re paying in interest will help you come up with a debt repayment strategy.

Lower Your Other Monthly Expenses

Next, you’ll want to look for ways to lower your other monthly expenses so you can free up money (if possible) to put toward your debt. You can use a budgeting app to see how much you’re spending each month, and look for expenses you can cut. 

Lower Your Debt Costs

You may also want to consider ways to lower your interest rate, so that the total cost of your debt falls. For example, you could try negotiating with your lender for a lower rate, or getting a balance transfer credit card or personal loan to consolidate your high-interest credit card debt at a lower rate.1 That, in turn, would lower your monthly payments. 

Choose a Repayment Strategy

Finally, you’ll choose a repayment strategy that works for you. Here are two you can consider for paying down loans and credit card debt:

Debt Snowball: With the debt snowball method, you’ll start by paying off your smallest debt first and making minimum payments on everything else. Once you pay off your smallest debt, you’ll apply that money toward the next smallest debt, essentially creating a “snowball” of payments as you pay off each balance. Research has shown that borrowers are more likely to pay off all their debt if they focus on paying down the smallest balances first. 2
Debt Avalanche: With the debt avalanche method, you’ll list out your debts based on the interest rates. Then you’ll focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first while making minimum payments on everything else. This plan doesn’t focus on the size of your debt—instead, the goal is to save the most money in interest payments. 
Note

The advantage of the debt snowball method is that since you start seeing progress right away, it can be very motivating to continue. But it means you may end up paying more money in interest as you won’t be focused on the costlier debts right away.3

Debt Repayment vs. Debt Management

When you’re facing debt, you may also consider a debt management plan. A debt management plan (DMP) is a kind of debt repayment plan—but it’s done with outside help. 

Debt Repayment	Debt Management
A plan to repay your debts over time	A type of debt repayment plan created and overseen by a third-party company 
You may come up with and implement the plan on your own and continue to pay your creditors directly.	A credit counseling company consolidates your debts and negotiates with your creditors to lower your interest rates and fees; you make one monthly payment to that agency, which pays your creditors.
You may choose to keep your credit cards open.	You are required to close credit cards included in the DMP so you can’t use them to incur more debt.
No extra cost	May require modest fees

While a DMP is more restrictive than a repayment plan you create on your own, you may find it helpful to have the extra structure and support. A credit counselor reviews your financial situation and works with you to create a tailored plan. They may also negotiate with your creditors to lower your interest rates. Counseling usually includes information about budgeting, making payments, and staying out of debt in the future. If you go this route, look for a credit counseling agency that’s part of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling or the Financial Counseling Association of America.

You may need to pay for a DMP, however. There may be an initial setup fee of up to $30-$50 and a monthly fee (usually $20-$75).4 If you go the DIY route, you of course won’t have those expenses.


Note

Don’t confuse nonprofit credit counseling companies with debt settlement companies. For-profit settlement companies often require you to stop making payments to your creditors altogether for many months in hopes of pressuring them to settle your debt for less than what you owe. But there’s no guarantee of success, and the process can ruin your credit score.5 

Key Takeaways
A debt repayment plan is a structure you put in place to pay off your outstanding debt.
The key to a successful debt repayment plan is assessing how much you owe, ways you can increase your monthly payments, and finding a strategy that works best for your budget.

 PORTRA / GETTY IMAGES

Debt will keep you from reaching your financial goals, like saving for retirement or buying a home. It can be a source of stress and grief, causing you to constantly worry about your finances and regret the limits debt has placed on your life.

Fortunately, debt isn’t a life sentence. You can (and should) make getting out of debt a priority. Follow these seven steps to take control of your finances and pay off your debt for good.

1. Understand the Type of Debt You Have

Getting out of debt—and staying out—requires that you change the habits or circumstances that led you to debt in the first place.

Understanding the type of debt you have and how it happened can help you create a plan for paying it off and make it less likely that you will fall back into debt in the future.

Note

If you have debt that you don’t know how to manage, consider talking to a credit counselor. Credit counseling agencies are usually nonprofit organizations, such as the Financial Counseling Association of America or the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. They are staffed with trained agents who can help you with:

Understanding your debt
Tracking your spending
Creating a budget
Developing a debt repayment plan1
Debt Due to Loans

Taking out loans happens naturally at certain stages of life. You may take out a loan to open a small business, buy a house with a mortgage, purchase a new car with an auto loan, or take on student loans to fund your education.

These debts are not inherently bad and often come with manageable interest rates. However, they can create a strain on your finances when you are unable to make the required payments. They can eat up too much of your income, preventing you from covering living expenses or saving money.

When that happens, you may find yourself taking on other debt, either in the form of credit card debt or personal loans, to make up the difference.

Debt Due to Circumstance

Sometimes debt accumulates due to circumstances outside your control. Many people have medical debt stemming from unexpected illnesses or injuries. You may have debt due to divorce. Or you may have become unemployed and had to take on credit card debt or take out personal loans or payday loans.

These debts can be crushing because they come with high interest rates. Often, you are forced to take them on when your financial circumstances were already strained. And as you attempt to pay them off, they can eat into your income and require you to take on more debt, creating a debt spiral that feels impossible to escape.

In many instances, such as when medical bills go to a collection agency, you may not even be aware that the debt exists until a collection agent calls you at home to report that you have unpaid bills.2

Debt Due to Spending

Thoughtless or reckless spending can create its own debt, usually in the form of high-interest credit card debt. Living beyond your means, such as taking out a mortgage your income cannot support or buying a car you cannot afford with an auto loan, can also create debt due to spending.

Once you accumulate debt due to overspending, you end up paying far more in interest and penalties than the actual value of what you purchased. This can tie up your income, requiring you to take on even more debt. Living beyond your means can even cause you to default on payments or end up declaring bankruptcy.

2. Take Control of Your Spending

Whether or not careless spending habits contributed to your situation, you will find it easier to start to pay off your debt if you keep close control of your spending and finances.

Take time to compare your monthly income with your expenses. Divide your spending into mandatory expenses, or needs, and discretionary expenses, or wants.

Mandatory expenses include things like:

Rent or mortgage payments
Utilities
Food
Transportation to/from work
Health insurance
Child support
Prescriptions
Childcare

Discretionary expenses include things like:

Cable TV
Gym memberships
Eating out
Clothing
Entertainment
Home decor
Personal grooming

To start paying off your debt, your monthly expenses will need to be significantly lower than your monthly income. You may be able to achieve this just by reducing your discretionary spending.

Note

Pay your bills on time to save money. Late payments usually trigger fees or service charges that can make it harder to reduce your spending. Where possible, automate your payments to come from your checking account.

If that’s not enough, however, you may need to take further control of your spending by lowering your mandatory expenses as well. You can use tactics like:

Downsizing if you rent your home or negotiating your rent
Renting out a room or floor if you own your home
Choosing a cheaper cellphone plan
Splitting internet access with a neighbor
Choosing a less expensive health insurance plan
Looking for ways to cook cheaply, such as eliminating meat from your diet
Using public transit instead of your car

You can also look for ways to increase your income, even temporarily, such as:

Taking on a second job
Doing occasional gig work
Putting all your credit card rewards toward cash payments instead of points
Insisting on payment for money you are owed, such as child support or alimony
Selling household items, jewelry, or clothing
Note

Local pawnshops make it easy to sell your items for cash. However, you will likely make more money if you sell directly to other consumers through Craigslist, eBay, Etsy, or your local consignment shop.

Once you have reduced your spending as much as possible, create a budget. This will prevent you from accidentally overspending. You want to make sure your expenses stay below your income, otherwise you will end up owing more money in the form of credit card interest or overdraft fees.

Reducing your spending as much as possible and taking control of your finances with a budget will allow you to put all almost your extra money toward paying off your debt.3

3. Figure Out How Much Debt You Have

If you have more that one type of debt, it can be easy to lose track of how much you owe and how much you are paying in interest every month. But you cannot begin to pay off your debt until you know what those values are.

Make a list of all your debts, how much you currently owe, and the interest rate being charged. Use recent billing statements, canceled checks or bank statements, and your credit report to get a complete list of everyone you owe and the amount you owe. Be sure to include the minimum payment required for each account. This is the smallest amount that you can afford to pay on your debt every month.

Note

Including the interest rate associated with each account will show you not only how much you currently owe but also which debts are the most expensive. High-interest debts, like credit card debt or payday loans, can cost you many times the value of the loan itself because of the amount of interest that is added on every month.

4. Decide How Much You Can Afford To Pay

If you pay only the minimum every month, it can take years or even decades to finally pay off your debt. To eliminate your debt much faster, you’ll have to send more than the minimum payment to at least one of your accounts each month.

Use your monthly budget to decide how much you can spend on debt repayment each month. Subtract your expenses from your income, including any irregular or periodic expenses that may pop up during the month. What's left over after you’ve covered all your necessary expenses is the amount you can spend on your debt. Use this amount in your debt plan.

Note

If your income varies per month, base your amounts for your budget and debt repayment on the lowest income you expect to have. If you have extra some months, you can use that money for debt repayment. The more money you can put toward your debt, the faster you can have it paid off.

Remember, you need to make the minimum payment on each debt every month, so however much you have in your budget for debt repayment, you will first need to subtract every minimum repayment from that value. Whatever is leftover, you can put toward truly paying off your debt.

For Example
Your monthly income is $4,000, and your monthly expenses are $3,500.
$4000 – $3500 = $500 for total debt repayment.
You have three debts with minimum payments of $50, $75, and $100 per month.
$500 – $50 – $75 – $100 = $275 for accelerated debt repayment.
5. Put Together a Plan

Decide in what order you are going to pay off your debt. You can decide to prioritize based on the interest rate, balance, or some other criteria that you choose. You can also use additional debt management strategies to reduce your monthly payments or consolidate your debt.

Whatever debt repayment strategy you choose, stick to your plan and send payments on time every month to avoid additional fees and interest charges. Eliminating your debt completely can take months or years depending on the amount of debt you have and the payments you make. Consistency with your payments is a necessary part of getting out of debt.

Note

Debts that have gone into collection can do the most damage to your credit score, and repeated calls from collection agencies can damage your overall emotional well-being and stability. If you have debts that have gone to collection agencies, these are the ones you should repay first.

The Snowball Method

Using the snowball method, you pay off your debts from the smallest to the largest.

Note

The “snowball method” is a term coined by Dave Ramsey. The name refers to the strategy of starting with something small and building it into something bigger, the way a snowball is made.

Make the minimum payment on every debt, then put any extra funds you have toward the debt with the smallest balance. This will be the one you can pay off most quickly, allowing you to see immediate progress on your debt repayment.

Once this debt is paid off, move onto the next smallest debt on your list, while continuing to make the minimum payment on everything else. You will have more money to put toward paying off this debt because you now have fewer minimum payments to make every month.

Continue until you have paid off all your debts.

Debt Stacking

This strategy focuses on prioritizing debt by interest rates.

The higher the interest rate, the more a debt will cost you over time. Eliminating the debt with the highest interest rate will allow you to save the most money in the long run.

Note

Debt stacking is sometimes called the avalanche method, in contrast to the snowball method.

Make the minimum payment on every debt, then put any extra funds you have toward the debt with the highest interest rate. Once this debt is paid off, move on to the next highest interest rate while continuing to make the minimum payment on everything else. As with the snowball method, you will be able to put more money toward paying off each subsequent debt because you have one fewer minimum payment to make every month.

Student Loan Adjustments

If you have student loans, you may be able to have the amount you owe adjusted based on your income or financial situation, particularly if you have loans from the federal government. This can help you lower your monthly payments while you focus on paying off other debts or improving your financial situation.

Once you have eliminated your other debts, you can start to make higher payments on your student loans.

Debt Consolidation

If you are having trouble managing too many debts, you can consolidate them into a single debt, even if you want to consolidate with bad credit. This is a personal loan that covers the cost of your current debts, leaving you with only a single payment every month.

Consolidation does not eliminate your debt, but it does simplify it. However, it can be accompanied by high fees and variable interest rates that could end up being more expensive than what you were previously paying. Before consolidating your debt, it is best to speak to a credit counselor to decide whether this is the best course for your financial situation.

If you decide to use a debt consolidation loan, be careful not to take out additional loans or open new credit cards before it is eliminated. Otherwise, you will end up with additional debt that you cannot repay.4

6. Build an Emergency Fund

As you work toward paying off your debt, you should also start to put money away in and an emergency fund. Building an emergency fund gives you more flexibility to handle surprise expenses, which makes it less likely that you will go into debt again in the future.

Even a few hundred dollars can help if you need to have car repairs done or pay a doctor’s bill. This will reduce the likelihood that you have to take out a payday loan or additional credit card debt when unexpected expenses arise.

Note

Use a high-interest savings account or a money market account so your emergency funds earn interest but remain accessible at all times.

7. Don’t Create More Debt

Creating debt while you’re trying to pay off debt will hurt your progress and create more interest that you cannot pay off. While you are attempting to pay off your current debt, avoid using your credit cards, opening new credit accounts, or taking out new loans.

You may decide to close your credit card accounts entirely if you don’t think you’ll be able to resist using them. However, you can also keep a credit card on hand for emergencies but not use it for everyday spending.

Note

You can freeze your credit cards to prevent yourself from using them if you don’t want to close the accounts completely. Place your credit cards in a bowl or plastic bag full of water, then put them in the freezer. You’ll have to put in a lot of effort to get them out of the ice, which will give you time to rethink using credit before you’re out of debt.

You can estimate the time it will take you to become debt-free by using a debt repayment calculator. Some let you enter a specific monthly payment or a debt-free deadline to customize your repayment plan.

Note that your debt repayment time may fluctuate depending on the amount you're paying toward your debt and whether you create additional debt. Revisit the debt repayment calculator once or twice a year to see how you’re progressing toward your debt-free timeline.

8. Bounce Back From Setbacks

It may not be smooth sailing on your path to debt freedom.

A financial emergency could require you to cut back on your increased payment for a few months. You may find yourself needing to use credit cards or take out a personal loan to handle an unexpected situation.

When that happens, recalculate your budget and pick back up with your payments as quickly as possible. Overcome discouragement and keep your debt repayment on track.

Creating debt milestones may help you stay focused and encouraged while you pay off your debt. By celebrating the small successes, like paying off your first loan or eliminating 10% of your total debt, you can make it easier to stay motivated toward eliminating your debt completely.

If you are a recent college graduate you likely have some major life transitions coming your way in the not so distant future. Despite all of the financial uncertainties that may be looming over the horizon it is important to have a financial plan to guide you during the transition.

Financial plans are essential whether you are getting started in your career, moving to a brand new city, or simply trying to upgrade your home or apartment. However, if you are like many other recent graduates you may have trouble thinking about retirement since you may be beginning your life after school. Using the concept of beginning with the end in mind, here are some tips to help you achieve true financial freedom (a.k.a. “retirement” in some circles):

1. Establish a Written Financial Plan That Is Flexible

Just remember that your financial plan will not probably look anything like your parents’ financial plan. You can begin the creation of your written plan by making a list of “SMART” financial goals. But don’t stop there! Be sure to create a list of other important life goals and put them in writing. Some people find that creating a “dream board” is a helpful way to visualize your goals and stay focused.

When you are creating your list of life goals you can also include a separate list of possible life events that may be just over the horizon. These possibilities could be those major unknowns in life that you want to eventually be prepared for and work into your financial planning. A few examples include buying a first home, getting married, having a child, going back to school, or taking a brief sabbatical to travel the world.

Taking the time to create a written list of your life goals will help you stay focused on what matters the most to you during this important season of life. A written financial plan also gives seemingly mundane tasks such as budgeting, saving, and investing more purpose and meaning.

So, how can you make sure that your financial plan is more impactful than “traditional” plans of the past? You can start by keeping your plan short and simple and it doesn’t need to be any longer than a one-page financial plan.

2. Create a Realistic and Flexible Budget or Personal Spending Plan

If you really want to achieve the authentic financial freedom you have to dare to be different than the average person. The average American does not follow a spending plan. Budgeting doesn’t have to be an overly complex or frustrating person. In fact, you simply need to have a plan that provides some general spending guidelines before the month begins.

There are many different budgeting systems that work. Online tracking tools like Mint and YouNeedABudget are just some of the many tools available to help. Here is an easy spending plan using a simple spreadsheet approach. No matter how you choose to create your budget it is essential that you use this spending plan as a guide regardless of your income or net worth.

3. Make Savings Automatic

When you examine your spending plan you should strive to put savings as a top priority. Always strive to save as much as you possibly can, but focus on saving in the right type of accounts. An emergency fund is one of the first places to direct your savings efforts. Most financial planners recommend trying to maintain at least 3 to 6 months of basic living expenses in a separate account from your everyday checking account. This is an ideal long-term goal but it can be a very difficult goal to reach if you are just starting out in a new career after graduation.

During your 20’s and 30’s, there is a tendency to let present bias make it difficult to find the balance between current spending and planning for the future. That is why you will have more success in reaching your goals when you choose to automate savings through payroll deduction or automatic transfers of at least 10% of your income.

4. Realize When It Is Okay to Prioritize Paying off Debt Ahead of Savings

There are a few exceptions to the ultimate goal of keeping 3 to 6 months of living expenses in an emergency savings fund. One of those exceptions is if you have high-interest credit cards or other personal loans. In that case, it is necessary to establish a “starter emergency fund” which may be 1-2k and then make extra payments on that debt with that are above and beyond the required minimum payments.

One of the best financial habits to create early in your career is to always pay the full balance due on credit cards each month.

5. Avoid Future Temptations to Remove Money From Your Retirement Accounts

The days of working for one employer throughout an entire career are long gone. So it’s no surprise that your first job after graduation will not be your last. Many people make the mistake of cashing out retirement plans when switching jobs instead of benefitting from continued tax deferral through 401(k) or IRA rollovers. Not only are 401(k) withdrawals subject to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty they also rob us of future retirement savings.1 From my experience as a financial planner, I’ve found early retirement plan distributions to be one of the leading causes of IRS tax problems and a decision most people will end up regretting later in life.

6. Recognize That Your Credit Score Is Important but Does Not Guarantee Financial Freedom 

Yes, it is important to consistently monitor and review your credit…but don’t obsess over it. That being said, you shouldn’t wait until you are ready to buy a car or house to check your credit score. If you haven’t started building your credit while in college, don't worry. You may have to shart small—like with a fixed-limit credit card—but it is something you can do.

You can visit free sites such as the Annual Credit Report.com website to obtain credit reports from Transunion, Equifax, and Experian. Other no-cost resources such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. These reports will allow you to view your credit score. The sites and also provide free credit monitoring services that can help alert you when anything unusual happens to your credit. 

A best practice financial action step is to always check your credit report at least once per year and take steps to protect your credit and your financial identity. Just remember that a good credit score will help you qualify for competitive interest rates on future mortgages and can even help you consolidate existing debt to a lower interest rate. True financial freedom will occur when you have eliminated debt and no longer need to rely on a credit score.

7. Focus on Financial Priorities Rather Than Letting Student Loan Frustration Guide Your Decisions

According to recent estimates, the average student loan debt for federal loans is $36,406.2 Student loans definitely appear extremely overwhelming when you first graduate from school. However, there are a variety of payment options available and it’s essential to recognize that student loans aren’t the only form of debt to be laser-focused on.

Other important financial priorities such as paying down high-interest consumer debt (e.g. credit cards, personal loans) are often viewed as a higher priority. In addition, it is important to establish your financial freedom fund (a.k.a. the “emergency fund”) prior to making extra payments on your student loans.

8. Define What Financial Independence Means to You

I’ve had the opportunity to speak with recent graduates in my role as a financial educator. While many of these financial workshops are focused on saving and investing for retirement I don’t use that word “retirement” too much. After a 16 year career as a financial planner, I personally find the word retirement to be a very difficult concept to define. The reality is that every one of us should have our own unique definition of retirement. But it is extremely difficult for recent graduates to consider the idea of life after work since most grads are just launching new careers.

Instead of focusing on a long-term goal and trying to predict what your future self will be like, place your emphasis on defining what financial freedom looks like to you in the here and now.

What do you look forward to doing the most? How do you enjoy spending your time today? What are some future life goals you want to achieve?

Unfortunately, not all of us are innately programmed to plan for the future and it is easy to let the YOLO principle guide financial decisions. Don’t let present bias derail your good intentions or prevent you from doing any planning for the future.

9. Use the Tax Code to Legally Avoid Taxes and Increase Your Savings

Not everyone has the time, energy, or desire to master the IRS tax code. But if you devote enough time to understanding the basics you will be on the fast track to financial freedom. Start by contributing as much as possible to your 401(k) or retirement plan at work. At a minimum, you should always take full advantage of any matching contributions offered by your employer. Then focus on choosing the right asset location for your retirement savings. The pre-tax vs. Roth 401(k) decision is primarily based on whether you need the tax break now (pre-tax) or in the future (Roth).

If you don’t have a retirement plan available to you through an employer you have the ability to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you are in a high deductible health care plan that is HSA eligible, contribute as much as you can in order to lower your taxes today. The good news with HSAs is that you will be able to take out this money tax-free anytime for health care expenses and they can help supplement your retirement savings.3

From a financial planning standpoint, the years following graduation are an important time to begin laying the foundation to achieve real financial freedom as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, not all schools teach these important financial lessons and experience is often the best way to learn. If you or someone you care about is a recent graduate be sure to celebrate your accomplishments and set the stage as early as possible for an even bigger task—true financial independence.

Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Best Way to Set a Budget?

Different methods might be best for different people. For example, many computer programs can help track income and expenses, and they even can be connected to your financial accounts to automatically import data. Others might want to handle the process manually. Regardless, the important thing to do is to set a budget so you can know exactly where you stand with your finances.

What Are the Keys to Managing Personal Finances?

Be as detailed as possible when managing your personal finances. Sticking to a budget, paying down debt, and knowing exactly where every dollar is going can help make it possible to increase your savings. Having the details to find that extra $10 or $20 per week or month that you can save or invest today can add up to thousands of dollars years from now.

What Are the Key Elements of Financial Planning?

Budgeting is a big part of financial planning. To be successful, it is important to account for everything necessary to financial health. In addition to simply knowing your income and expenses, you have to think about where you will be in the future with income and expenses. Insurance, a good investment plan, and more can help you with expected and unexpected expenses that may arise.

You probably know that a savings account is an excellent place to keep money safe, but you don't have to stick to one account. Opening multiple savings accounts can help with budgeting and organizing your finances. You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or loss of your job.

You can also have a savings account for each goal, such as saving up for a family trip or buying a home. Depending on your bank, there's likely no limit to how many savings accounts you can open, but it can be challenging to keep track of them after a certain point.

Learn the benefits of multiple savings accounts, how many you can have, and how you can use them to organize your finances.

Key Takeaways
Don't limit yourself to one savings account since multiple accounts can help with budgeting, organizing your finances, and saving for your financial goals.
You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or loss of your job.
Setting up multiple savings accounts is easy if your bank allows it. You can also have accounts at multiple institutions.
A strategy helps you define your goals and how you will reach them, keeping you on track.
Why Use Multiple Savings Accounts?

There are several benefits to having more than one savings account.

It Sets Money Aside

Setting up different savings accounts for specific financial goals helps you save for those goals. You begin by moving money out of your primary checking or savings account to a new savings account. Doing this removes it from easy access and helps you resist the temptation to spend the money you've earmarked for something else.

It Automates Your Savings

You can automate monthly transfers to multiple savings accounts if you have a steady income. That way, you never forget to save for your goals, and you get money in the right place quickly.

Many banks have automatic transfer features that come standard with your account. If yours doesn't, you might be able to transfer funds to another bank, but check to see if the bank will charge you for it.

Note

Automatic transfers keep you from forgetting to save. However, make sure you deduct the money you have scheduled for transfer from your budget, so you don't forget it will be transferred and spend it.

It Protects You From Yourself

After you move money into a savings account earmarked for a particular goal, you may experience some guilt if you raid that account for luxury items or unnecessary expenses. This behavioral trick can help you stay on track.

You Can Monitor Your Progress

Multiple savings accounts let you track your progress toward your goals. When everything is mixed together, it’s less clear where you stand because your money is all in one place. You can even label each savings account with the goal you have to help you track your financial plan.

You Can Build Momentum

Success is motivating. If you see an account growing, you have positive reinforcement to continue your saving behavior. Working toward your goals is more enjoyable, and you’re more likely to keep it up.

You Hold Yourself Accountable

Using multiple savings accounts lets you quickly see why you're not meeting your financial goals. In other words, your account balance doesn’t lie. If you decide to save money for something but don’t follow through, it’s important to figure out what’s happening.

Note

If you're not meeting your savings goals, you'll need to make sure you're tracking all of your expenses and spending. Then, make sure your goals are realistic; look at the timeline you've set for yourself and make sure you can save the amount you want with the expenses, budget, and time you have.

You Smooth Your Spending

A dedicated savings account can help you budget for significant annual expenses. For example, if you pay property taxes and homeowners insurance annually instead of using an escrow account, you might want to add to a savings account every month to build up the funds you need. By spreading out the burden of annual costs, you can avoid spending shocks throughout the year.


Your Savings Is Insured

If you’re fortunate enough to have significant cash savings, you might open savings accounts at different banks to keep your account balances below FDIC insurance limits. The $250,000 limit is typically per account per institution, so keeping excess amounts at a different institution helps you stay safe (ensure the bank is under separate coverage).1 That said, having more than $250,000 in one bank may be possible—ask your bank for details.

Using Multiple Savings Accounts

There is a little more to it than just setting up multiple savings accounts and putting money into them. Creating a strategy can help you get your savings organized and help money flow to the correct accounts.

Note

If you’ve merged your finances with a spouse or partner, it may make sense to open several savings accounts. You can place money in separate accounts for spending on hobbies or yourselves. You could also create another account for joint goals and expenses. Discuss how you want to handle finances, and design a system that feels right for everybody.

Identify What You're Saving For

The first step is to identify what you're saving for. Find out how much your goals will cost, then figure out if you'll be able to save that much realistically. For example, if you wanted to take your family to Disneyland, you'd pick the length of your vacation, how many days it takes to travel, and all the costs involved in getting there.

A three-day Park Hopper ticket costs $390 per adult and $370 per child. If you have a spouse and two children, you'd need $1,520 plus travel, lodging, and meals.2

Let's say that four nights in a hotel costs $1,000, and $800 for 12 meals. Also, it cost $1,000 for round-trip flights and $150 for a car rental. As a result, it's possible that you'll need $4,470 plus 10% for extra expenses. So if you can only save $100 per month for this trip, it would take nearly 45 months to save the $4,470 you need.

If you have multiple goals, you'll need to compensate for those by playing with the numbers and timeline to make sure you can save enough and meet your monthly expenses at the same time.

Find Out What Your Bank Offers

Second, you should find out if your bank lets you open multiple savings accounts. Look for monthly fees, required minimums, transfer fees, transfer limits, or any other factors that might cost you extra if you use multiple accounts.

If your bank doesn't have what you need, look for another bank. Online banks can also have what you need; in fact, they might offer the easiest approach to using more than one savings account. For example, Ally Bank allows you to open up to 10 sub-savings accounts as part of your primary account.3 Online banks also offer sub-accounts, which have several benefits:

No monthly fees, in most cases, which can wipe out any interest you earn or take from your savings
No account minimums, allowing you to start small
Competitive interest rates, helping you grow your savings
Automate as Much as Possible

Third, once you've identified your goals and figured out how much you can save, consider the automatic transfers mentioned previously. This is important when implementing your strategy because it makes sure you're paying yourself.

Life happens, you may get busy, and moving funds to a different savings account might not be at the top of your priority list. To ensure you keep saving, link your primary checking account to your savings accounts and schedule automatic transfers for each pay period.

Note

It can also help to create a plan to stop all of your automated transfers in case a life event changes your situation. You can keep a list of all of your automated transfers or create a checklist you can follow to make sure you keep your finances organized if a stressful event occurs.

Refine Your Strategy

A good rule of thumb when planning and implementing a financial strategy is that it's best to look over your plan every two or three months or anytime you experience a change that might affect your finances. Many people experience events that can change how they save, how much they save, or what they are saving for. With that in mind, you might have to adjust your payments over time, but that's okay as long as you keep working at it.

To help you address any life events, you can prioritize your goals. That way, if something happens, you can reallocate money to fund your high-priority goal; you'd ""borrow"" from your lower-priority accounts. Diverting funds from your other accounts isn't ideal, but reality occasionally forces your hand—being able to take it in stride by having a plan, making adjustments, and keeping it going is what will get you to your financial goals.

Frequently Asked Questions
How many savings accounts should I have for budgeting?

You should have enough savings accounts to organize your finances. You should have a savings account as an emergency fund for life's unexpected expenses. Also, you could have an account for each goal, such as saving up for a family trip or a downpayment to buy a home.

How many savings accounts can you have?

The number of savings accounts you're limited to depends on your bank. Some might not have a limit, while others might only let you have one. If you need more than one, talk to your bank or shop for a bank that lets you have multiple savings accounts.

Should I keep all of my money in one bank?

The money you have in your bank account is ensured up to $250,000 per institution by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). You can keep more than this in a bank account at one bank if the bank allows it, but the entire amount won't be federally insured. Check with your bank to see how much you can keep in your accounts.

How much does the average person have in their savings account?

According to the Survey of Consumer Finances done in 2019 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, it depends on the consumer's age. Those 65-74 years old average about $61,000, 55-64 about $58,000, 45-54 have around $48,000. Ages 35-44 have about $28,000, and those less than age 35 have about $11,000 saved.4

Budgeting is the personal finance tool for taking control of your money.

A budget is a written plan for how you will spend your money. It allows you to make financial decisions ahead of time, which makes it easier to cover all your expenses along with paying off debt, saving for the future, and being able to afford fun expenses. Budgeting consistently can help you turn your finances around and start the process of building wealth.

Why Budgeting Is Important in Personal Finance

A budget is a powerful tool because it allows you to determine how and where you want to spend your money. When you master budgeting, you make sure that every dollar is being used how you want it, and can track your spending to determine whether it matches your priorities.

Often when people start budgeting, they are surprised to see how much money is going to things that are not important to them, like eating out, mindless online shopping, or high-interest payments on credit cards.

Budgeting allows you to monitor your progress on financial goals and stick to your financial plan. Eventually, it creates opportunities to eliminate debt and build wealth.

Create a Budget in Nine Steps

To create a budget, you have to start by creating a picture of your financial situation. It helps to have a list of the bills that you must pay each month, as well as your pay stubs, and either bank records or receipts from the past three months.

Step One: Determine Your Income

Begin by listing your monthly income. This should include any paychecks you receive, as well as income from other sources, such as:

Child support
Government benefits
Social Security
Investments1

If you have a business, you should include the amount you pay yourself each month rather than the business's total income. If you do not get paid monthly, look at how much income you had last year and divide it by 12 to determine your likely monthly income this year.2

Step Two: List Categories of Mandatory Expenses

Mandatory expenses are the expenses that you must pay every month and are vital to your housing, work, or legal obligations. These should include things like:

Rent
Electricity
Water
Heat
Internet
Food
Health insurance
Prescriptions you take daily or monthly
Child care
Transportation to and from work

You can usually identify mandatory expenses because they are fixed amounts, although some, such as electricity or water, can vary month to month. If you have debt payments, such as student loans or credit card payments, they should also be included. Don't worry about assigning values yet; simply make a list of the categories.

Step Three: List Categories of Discretionary Expenses

Next, identify your discretionary expenses. These are things you can go without but often choose to spend money on. They are wants, rather than needs, and may include:

Fitness memberships
Clothing
Cable TV
Streaming subscriptions
Eating out
Leisure travel
Personal grooming
House cleaning
Home decor

You can also include savings goals, such as retirement accounts or a down payment fund, as discretionary expenses for now. There will not be immediate consequences if you scale back on these for a little while, although there may be long-term consequences if you ignore them for an extended period of time. Once your budget is under control, you can move these to mandatory expenses with fixed monthly contributions.

Step Four: Estimate Expenses

Once you have all your spending categories listed, it's time to assign monetary values to them. Without looking at your spending patterns, write down what you think you must or will spend in each category in a month.

Step Five: Compare Estimated to Actual Expenses

Now, go back through your spending history for the last three months and determine what you actually spent in each category per month. You can use your receipts or bank statements to determine what you actually spent. Compare these to the numbers you estimated.

Note

If there is a big difference between the two, that is a strong indicator you need a strict budget to manage your spending and keep track of your finances.

Step Six: Assign Spending Limits Within Your Income

Once you have a sense of how much you are spending per month compared to what you think you spend, it's time to set spending limits. Start by budgeting for mandatory expenses, then add up these values and subtract them from your income.

The amount you have left is what you can budget for discretionary expenses and savings goals.1 What you budget for expenses should not be more than your income; otherwise, you will end up in debt.

If you have debt payments, start by budgeting for the minimum payment, then add more if you have available funds leftover. If you have additional money after you plan your budget, you can add it to the categories for financial goals like saving for retirement or building an emergency fund. After that, you can budget more for discretionary expenses and luxuries.

Step Seven: Look for Places To Cut Expenses

If you have more expenses than income, you will need to find ways to cut back on your expenses. Start by lowering the spending limits in the discretionary section of your budget or eliminating them entirely.

Next, look for ways you can reduce your mandatory expenses, such as:

A cheaper monthly insurance premium
Using less electricity at home
Taking the bus to work instead of driving
Spending less on groceries

If your expenses are still more than your income, you may need to increase the amount you earn by negotiating a raise, adding a second job, or taking on gig work.

Step Eight: Track Your Spending

Once you have your budget set for the month, you will need to track your spending and stop when you have reached the limit in each category. When you stop spending, that's called sticking to your budget.

If you end up spending more in one category than you had planned, you can transfer money into that category to cover it from another category. For example, if you budgeted $400 for food for one month and you ended up spending $450, then you can move $50 from another category to cover it. To do this, you will need to check your spending before making purchases to see how much you have left.

Step Nine: Plan for The Next Month

After you have completed your first month of budgeting, it will be easier to plan for the next month. Look at how you spent your money, make adjustments for categories in which you spent more than you planned, and cut back on the categories that had additional funds in them.4

You should also look ahead to large expenses coming up, such as insurance premiums that are only due every few months or upcoming holiday expenses. Plan for these larger expenses as you set your budget for the next month.

Budgeting Strategies

Every person is different, and one strategy may work better for you than another. If you are new to budgeting, try out different options to find the one that works best for your spending habits and financial mindset.

Envelope Budget

How it works: In an envelope budget, you assign money to each category and deal with cash for as many categories as possible. At the beginning of each month, take the appropriate amount of cash out of your bank account and put it in a designated, physical envelope labeled with the name of each category. When you run out of money in that category, you either stop spending, or you have to take cash from the envelope for a different category to cover the difference.

Good for: People who are not good at tracking expenses or who need to stop using their debit or credit cards.

Note

If you want to pay bills online or transfer money into a savings account, set those to be paid at the very beginning of the month, then take cash out for the remaining expenses after those bills have been gone through.

50/30/20 Budget 

How it works: The 50/30/20 budget breaks down how much you should be spending on different categories. Fifty percent of your after-tax income is to be spent on your mandatory expenses, or needs; 30% should be spent on discretionary expenses, or wants; and 20% should be tailored toward savings and debt repayment.5

Good for: People who want to focus on financial goals.

Note

Make sure to separate savings and debt repayment from other expenses, rather than including them in either living expenses or discretionary spending.

Zero-Dollar Budget

How to works: A zero-dollar budget involves planning how you are going to spend your income down to the last penny. Every dollar of income you make for the month should be assigned to a spending category. This allows you to know where all of your money is going at any given time. It also makes it more important to monitor your budget regularly.

Good for: People who need to get control of spending.

Note

Be sure to include a category for surprise expenses. If you have any extra income to budget at the beginning of the month, it can go into this category, then roll over into the next month if you don't spend it. This will allow you to build up a short-term emergency fund.

Five-Category Budget

How it works: The five-category budget sets up five basic categories and determines the percentage you should spend on each one. For housing, you can spend up to 35% of your income. Living expenses, which include mandatory expenses such as groceries, your cellphone bill, and discretionary spending, should make up 25% of your spending. Allocate 15% each for transportation and debt payoff. Finally, set aside 10% of your income for savings.

Good for: People who have some wiggle room in their finances but may have small amounts of debt.

Note

Housing expenses include your mortgage payment or rent, as well as household utilities, home maintenance, HOA fees, and homeowners or renter's insurance.

How To Make Budgeting Easier

It takes a lot of work to track your expenses, and for many people, budgeting can feel restrictive. If you share finances with another person, disagreements over spending can cause resentment or fighting.

The first two or three months of budgeting are the hardest, as you adjust categories and work on cutting your spending. Luckily, there are ways to make budgeting easier.

Use a budgeting app: Tools like You Need a Budget (YNAB) or Mint will import your transactions for you and make it easier to assign categories, adjust the amounts, and track your spending. A single account can be shared between multiple people who need to track spending together.
Use cash: Consider switching to cash for some categories, even if you aren't using an envelope budget. If you consistently overspend in a single category, such as eating out or groceries, take out cash at the beginning of the month for this category rather than using a debit or credit card to cover those expenses.
Check on your budget each day: Set aside five minutes in the morning or evening to look at your spending and bank account. This can keep you from making a mistake or overdrawing your account.
Find ways to save: The more money you can save on your daily expenses, the easier it will be to stick to your budget. Look for ways to save on your groceries, lower your utilities, negotiate on bills, and more. Shopping around for the best deals can make budgeting less stressful.
Open an online bank account: If you don't already have a bank account, open a checking account through an online bank. These often have lower minimum deposits and fees than accounts through brick-and-mortar banks. Once you have a bank account, you can set up online payments, create savings or retirement accounts, and more easily track where your money is going.
Make budgeting automatic: Schedule rent, loan repayment, or other mandatory expenses to be automatically paid on your payday. This will prevent you from accidentally spending that money on discretionary expenses. You can also schedule automatic transfers into your savings or retirement accounts. You can either do this automatically through your online bank accounts, by setting up different accounts where percentages of your paycheck can be deposited, or by using a budget app that can access your bank account.
Work towards a goal: Sticking to a budget can be difficult, especially if you aren't used to regulating your spending. To motivate yourself, set a goal that you are saving toward: eliminating debt, building an emergency fund, getting to the point where you have more discretionary income, saving for travel, or any other goal you are determined to meet. Working toward a set goal can keep you focused and remind you why sticking to a budget is worth it.
Why You Should Keep Budgeting

Once you have your finances under control, have eliminated debt, or have met other financial goals you set, that doesn't mean you should stop budgeting.

Sticking to a budget makes it less likely you will accumulate debt or end up with large expenses you have no way to meet. It also allows you to save money for fun expenses, such as travel, and eventually get to the point where you can build wealth through investing.

Even when you have plenty of money to meet your mandatory and discretionary expenses, budgeting is still an essential part of smart personal finance. Using a budget allows you to understand your financial situation and manage your money. It puts you in control, rather than allowing your money to control you.

Having a trustworthy financial institution is essential for any organization. However, what is the best option for a nonprofit? Should you choose a commercial bank or a credit union? What should you consider when making a choice? Picking a bank for your nonprofit can be overwhelming, and switching institutions can be even harder. To understand how to go about choosing the best bank for your nonprofit, read on for a few tips, as well as the banks we feel are the top contenders.

Key Takeaways
Many national and local banks and credit unions offer accounts that can meet the needs of nonprofits.
Choosing the right institution for your bank involves multiple factors, including fees, accessibility, and interest rates.
When considering a bank or credit union, be sure to ask how much experience they have working with nonprofits.

Commercial Banks, Small Banks, or Credit Unions?

Commercial banks are often the first choice for nonprofits, mainly because of their presence and overall visibility. These banks often have accounts created specifically for nonprofits and can offer exceptional amenities. Because they have a national presence, there are few things these commercial banks don’t deliver in all 50 states.

Smaller banks could be a great option for nonprofits who want to support the community in which they reside. These banks have many of the same amenities of larger, national chains. However, they may not offer as many business-style services, like wire transfers or coin deposits.

Credit unions, on the other hand, operate as not-for-profit institutions themselves. They fund their member benefits and community initiatives with the interest from their accounts and member fees.1

How to Choose a Financial Institution

Whether you decide to enroll with a credit union, small bank, or a commercial bank, you’ll need to make sure the institution you choose has everything you need. Here are six critical factors to consider when selecting a financial institution for your nonprofit organization.

Accessibility

A financial institution won't be of much use if it can’t give you what you need when you need it. Before choosing a bank, consider:

Does the bank have a physical branch located near you?
What kind of customer support do they offer?
Do they offer mobile banking?
What are their deposit limits?
How many people can access the account(s)?
What are the rules regarding access?

If you need any specific features such as ATM access, mobile banking, ACH (automated clearing house) payments, foreign currency transactions, insurance coverage, or fraud control, make sure your financial institution can provide those.

Fees

Any time you’re choosing a partner to work with long-term, it’s important to consider the cost. Financial institutions use a variety of fee structures, so make sure you get clarity on what your out-of-pocket costs will be. You may be asked to pay a monthly or annual fee. Some banks charge fees for each transaction, or transactions exceeding a certain limit. You may also see processing fees, added-user fees, ATM fees, or other maintenance fees.

Also, be sure to ask about minimum balances. Most institutions have a minimum to open an account, but many also have minimums that balances must exceed. You may face penalties if you don’t comply with those requirements.2

Interest Rates

For accounts used for basic operations, such as a business checking account, interest is probably not a big concern. However, if you’re maintaining any savings on behalf of your organization, a good interest rate can make a difference.

Note

If savings rates are important to you, spend some time researching high-interest accounts. The APY that banks and credit unions offer can vary widely from institution to institution.

Credit Products

While the fees and interest should always be an area of focus, make sure you’re considering credit availability. Some nonprofits use lines of credit as part of their strategic budget planning. Some like to have credit available in case of a slow funding period or in case of unforeseen budget complications. If you expect to use a line of credit at any point, find out what your institution requires and what it can offer you.

Experience

Like any other aspect of running a successful nonprofit, it helps to work with businesses who have experience with nonprofits. Some financial institutions have a strictly commercial portfolio, or where others have a wide range of expertise. Experience with small businesses can apply to small nonprofits, so look for this marker and ask potential institutions about their work with relevant industries. Find out if they’re capable and ready to support the needs you have that might differ from their commercial clients.

Note

It may also be helpful to request testimonials from current customers. These reviews can provide great insight into how other businesses and organizations feel about the products and services they’re receiving.

Ethics

As a nonprofit, it’s safe to say that ethics are a high priority, especially when it comes to how your business handles money. Although highly regulated, banking regulations can be cyclical, and there are always loopholes. Make sure to choose a bank that makes its ethical standards known.3

As a nonprofit, you should feel confident that the banks you work with are adhering to the same ethical standards to which you hold your organization. If you don’t think that the financial institution you’re considering (or currently use) is ethical, know that there are better options out there.

Nonprofit Banks and Credit Unions

With banks and credit unions serving local, regional, and national audiences, it can be difficult to pick just one. You should be looking for an institution that best serves your organization's needs. Within this category include those that cater to low-activity, low-balance businesses, as well as those banks with relationships similar to large businesses. Be sure to do thorough research and determine your long-term goals before deciding who can best support you. Also, consider a local bank or credit union. Most, though not all, offer similar services to larger commercial banks. Be sure to consider any cost differences that may arise when choosing a smaller bank or credit union, and make sure they abide by the ethics expected of any financial institution.

The Bottom Line

Just like your finances, it’s possible for your nonprofit to have accounts with multiple institutions. While you don’t want to over-complicate your organization’s finances, it’s still perfectly acceptable to choose various banks or credit unions based on the benefits they offer for different needs. One bank may provide more affordable merchant services while another offers higher interest rates for savings accounts, and it’s okay to create a financial plan that gives your business exactly what it needs. The entire process of finding a financial system that works for your nonprofit takes time, but now you’ll have more insight into what you can expect (and deserve) from a bank.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What type of bank account is best for a nonprofit organization?

It depends on what you're looking for. A high-yield savings account for businesses may be best if you're looking for a low-risk way to earn interest. If you do frequent transactions, a no-fee checking account with an annual percentage yield may work.

What should a nonprofit look for in a bank?

Some things a nonprofit should consider are what features the bank's accounts offer, if there are accounts tailored to nonprofits, fees, and how much experience the bank has working with nonprofits.

how to streamline budgeting with dedicated bank accounts,the balance money,headline_text,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/how-to-manage-your-bank-accounts-when-self-employed-315224,"PHOTO: 

ALISTAIR BERG / GETTY IMAGES

Self-employment has many perks, such as making your own hours, flexible working locations, and time off when you want.

When you become your own boss, however, there are some important things to take into consideration, such as managing your business finances, maintaining a budget, and planning for tax requirements. You often have more financial responsibilities than an employee with a regular paycheck.

One of the best ways you can juggle all your responsibilities as a self-employed person is by opening designated bank accounts and managing them on a monthly basis. That way, you can stay ahead of your expenses, eligible deductions, and income reporting when it comes time to pay taxes.

Although it may seem overwhelming, a little planning can go a long way when it comes to managing bank accounts. Learn what types of bank accounts to consider, how to budget for expenses and taxes, and what kinds of tools can help you along the way.

Key Takeaways
Opening dedicated business accounts is one of the first things you should consider when starting a new business.
Moving 30% of your income into a dedicated tax savings account will streamline your quarterly estimated tax filings, which are required for self-employed individuals.
Linking your accounts together with budgeting software will make it easy to manage your accounts, your retirement contributions, and your businesses financials.
Why You Need To Manage Bank Accounts

Although it’s not a requirement for most small businesses, separating your personal finances from your business expenses will help streamline your tax and income reporting. Essentially, managing your bank accounts well helps you stay organized so you can run your business efficiently.

Dedicated business bank accounts can help limit your personal liability, protect your customers’ private information, and establish credit history for your business.

Making the Most of Expenses

Businesses accrue numerous expenses, and keeping those organized will allow you and your tax professional to deduct those expenses accurately.

The IRS considers a business expense deductible if it is both ordinary for your industry and necessary for the course of business. If you work from home, for example, you can take advantage of the home-office deduction, which accounts for not only the office space, but supplies, utilities, and even a proportionate amount of your mortgage or rent.1

Similarly, if you run a client-based business, you can use that business bank account to pay for any client meetings, mileage, and other expenses that may be required to acquire new clients.

Note

Deductions are an important part of tax planning, so work with a tax professional to understand what you can deduct before committing to the expense.

Understanding what qualifies as a deductible expense can help you make major decisions while growing your business, such as whether to buy a car or enroll in continued education. Deducting expenses allows you and your business to keep more of your income, and can lower your tax burden significantly. So it’s important to maximize your available deductions.2

Prepare for Taxes

Seasoned self-employed business owners know the importance of keeping up with their tax responsibilities.

When you’re earning a W-2 income, the taxes are withheld and sent directly to the IRS for you. When you’re self-employed, you must set aside a significant portion of your income to avoid being hit with a major tax bill. Maintaining a bank dedicated to taxes can simplify the process.

In addition, you’ll need to plan for any sales taxes, employee taxes, and state and/or local taxes you and your business might owe. You can plan for your estimated taxes based on the income and expenses you’re seeing in your dedicated business bank account. Setting aside 30% to 35% of your earned income is a good rule of thumb, and using a separate bank account to do that can keep all your funds and expenses organized.

Note

There are unique situations for self-employed individuals, such as being able to deduct the employer portion of the Social Security tax from your self-employed tax. A tax professional can help you take advantage of tax-reduction opportunities.3

Open a Business Bank Account

Opening a business bank account is as simple as opening a personal checking account. You can open an account online or by visiting a bank or credit union branch. By providing some personal information and making a minimum deposit, you can open your account in one day, sometimes in a matter of minutes.

Like any bank account, fees can vary by banking product, or be waived entirely depending on the type of account you choose.

Consider local credit unions, online banks, and major banking institutions when you’re researching the best business bank account for you. Take advantage of any introductory offers.

Think about how your business will use a bank account. Do you have hundreds of daily sales, or are you simply using it to collect 1099 income from freelancing?

Note

Compare different accounts at different banks by evaluating if the monthly transactions you need are included, if there are any limits or fees on sending or receiving ACH payments, and whether there are any options for future lines of credit.

Self-Employed Retirement Accounts

Working for yourself also means you are responsible for your own retirement fund. Although managing another account may be the last thing you want to do, setting up a 401(k) or an IRA will ensure you receive tax advantages for retirement savings.

If you are a self-employed individual with no employees, you can set up a solo 401(k), which has the same rules, contribution limits, and tax benefits as any other 401(k). You may also consider a traditional or Roth IRA.4

Use Budgeting Software

Budgeting software can help you understand how your personal budget ties into your business budget. There are plenty of affordable budgeting software options to choose from to help you manage your bank accounts. Find an app or program that can fit your needs, perhaps by integrating bank accounts to help you manage your budgets and bank accounts in one place.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Do I need a business bank account if I’m self-employed?

Although it is recommended that every business open a separate bank account, legally, you must open one if your business is a separate legal entity or operating under a DBA (Doing Business As).

How many bank accounts can you have at once?

There is no limit as to how many bank accounts you can have. Depending on the type of bank account, you may have a minimum balance or deposit requirements to consider.

How do you link bank accounts?

Having all your accounts at one financial institution is the easiest way to link bank accounts. It allows for easier transfers between checking and savings. You may face fees and delayed funds if you’re transferring between accounts at different institutions.

THE BALANCE / BROOKE PELCZYNSKI 

If you're starting a small business, a major factor in its success lies in how well you market it. Marketing attracts prospects, prospects become buyers, and buyers provide profit. But marketing is more than just putting your business name out into the world. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, marketing must create a connection:

Marketing is everything an organization does to build a relationship between the company and consumer.1

This definition is more relevant today than ever before, when consumers encounter ads at every turn, and businesses are expected to be engaged and responsive.2

One of the smartest things a small business owner can do is take the time to develop a marketing plan. A marketing plan clearly outlines how you will reach your ideal customers by effectively implementing your marketing strategy.

There are countless ways to promote your small business, so it's important to identify and focus on the most effective tactics. Here is a list of 101 small business marketing ideas to get the wheels turning.

Marketing Planning

Marketing is about finding your ideal customer and sharing your message: How you'll make their lives better. To do that, you need to research and identify your target market, decide how your business will stand out, and develop a plan. Here are strategies to get started:

1. Update or create a marketing plan for your business.

2. Revisit or start your market research.

3. Refine your target audience and niche.

4. Write a unique selling proposition (USP).

5. Define the features and specifications of your product or service.

6. Match your features to benefits, for use in creating effective marketing messages.

Marketing Materials

Be prepared with custom resources you can share both online and in person. You should always have something with you that represents your company's mission and image that you can hand to a lead. The same concepts apply in online forums; a digital presence is crucial to success.

7. Create or update your business cards so they stand out from the rest.

8. Consider producing a leaflet or brochure if it will help spread the word in your industry.

9. Build a website, whether a simple landing page or a multi-functional online experience.

10. Get creative with promotional products and give them away at the next trade show or networking event you attend.

11. People hang on to things they can use, so create swag like magnets, pens, notebooks, stress balls, etc.

12. Utilize your USP for unique designs.

In-Person Networking

Even if your business is primarily online, consider adding networking to your marketing tactics. Remember, success in business is about relationships, and networking allows you to make the types of relationships that lead to sales, referrals, and other important business growth.

13. Write an elevator pitch.

Note

To craft a winning elevator pitch, start with a hook your lead can't ignore, let your enthusiasm shine through, and have the data ready to back up your claims.

14. Register for a conference.

15. Introduce yourself to other local business owners or join a formal networking group such as Business Network International.3

16. Plan a local business workshop.

17. Join your local chamber of commerce.

18. Rent a booth at a trade show.

Direct Mail

Direct mail can be expensive, but if you find a targeted list and send attractive offers, it can also be very effective—and profitable. In fact, direct mail results in five times more sales than email.4

19. Launch a multipiece direct mail campaign.

20. Create multiple approaches and split-test your mailings to measure impact.

21. Include a clear and enticing call to action on every direct mail piece.

22. Use tear cards, inserts, props, and attention-getting envelopes to make an impact with your mailings.

23. Send past customers free samples and other incentives to regain their business.

Advertising

Advertising and marketing are often confused, but in fact they are two different things. Marketing involves all aspects of getting your product or service to a market. Advertising is a part of marketing that involves getting your message about your product or service to the market.5

24. Buy a spot on the radio.

25. Advertise in a publication your target market reads.

26. Rent a billboard.

27. Use stickers or magnets to advertise on your car.

28. Take out an ad in your local newspaper.

29. Advertise on a local cable TV station.

30. Buy ad space on a relevant website.

31. Use a sidewalk sign to promote your specials.

Social Media Marketing

A reputable social media presence is no longer optional for small businesses. Most consumers expect to be able to follow a company's progress, view updates, and make connections with the community. Social media can help define your image, promote products, gain clientele, and build relationships. But like all other forms of marketing, you need to have a solid idea of who your audience is, where to find them, and how to talk to them. Finally, you need a social media plan.

Go Where Your Market Is

Managing multiple social media accounts, responding to user comments and questions, and keeping up with trends can be a lot of work. If it aligns with your marketing strategy, consider hiring a professional social media manager or outsourcing the work.

32. Get started with social media for business.

33. Create a Facebook page for your business.

34. Get a vanity URL or username for your Facebook page.

35. Create a Twitter account and start following experts and influencers.

36. Reply, retweet, or comment on other accounts.

37. Explore lesser-known or niche platforms, like Foursquare, Pinterest, Reddit, or Tumblr.

38. Create a LinkedIn profile for you and your business.

39. Write blog posts on a regular basis; post custom versions for different platforms.

40. If you aim to reach a younger crowd, make videos on TikTok.

41. Create an Instagram account and develop an attractive aesthetic.

42. Create an editorial calendar for your blog and social content.

Internet Marketing

There are a variety of ways to use the internet for marketing beyond social media. Here are a few other ideas:

43. Make sure you optimize your website and other online content using SEO.

44. Start a pay-per-click campaign using Google Ads or Facebook Ads.

45. Connect with social media influencers for promotional posts to reach their user base.

46. Record a video blog post to attach a face to the name.

47. Upload a video to YouTube.

48. Check your online directory listings and get listed in desirable directories.

50. Advertise on LinkedIn.

51. Set up Google Analytics on your website .

52. Review analytics statistics to learn more about your market and how to reach it.6

53. Stay on top of current and growing trends, such as new social media platforms or tools.

54. Learn more about local search marketing.

55. Track your online reputation.

56. Sign up for the Help a Reporter Out (HARO) service to be interviewed for media stories.

Email Marketing

It's easy to click ""follow"" on social media, but consumers aren't always eager to give out their email. When they do, it means they want to know what you offer. Having a well-tailored email list can be extremely valuable in your marketing efforts.

57. Create an email opt-in on your website or blog.

58. Offer a free download or free gift to entice people to give you their email address.

59. Send regular emails to your list.

60. Start a free monthly email newsletter.

61. Use A/B testing to measure the effectiveness of your email campaigns and consider segmenting the list to better target your markets' interests.

62. Perfect your email signature.

63. Use an email service to manage your list, such as Mailchimp or Constant Contact.

Contests, Coupons, and Incentives

People love free stuff and discounts. If you can provide that bit of serotonin that comes with free goodies, or winning a contest, you'll have a new fan.

64. Start a contest.

65. Create a coupon.

66. Create a ""frequent buyer"" rewards program.

67. Start a client appreciation or brand ambassador program.

68. Create a customer of the month program.

69. Give away a free sample.

70. Start an affiliate program.

Note

Giveaways and contests typically fall under state and federal regulations. Before you implement any gifting, make sure that you're following all the proper rules.

Relationship Building

Most marketing is about creating awareness of your business. But once you have people's attention, you need to build trust and rapport, whether that's through email or social media.

71. Send out a customer satisfaction survey.

72. Ask for referrals.

73. Make a referral.

74. Help promote or volunteer your time for a charity event.

75. Sponsor a local sports team.

76. Cross-promote your products and services with other local businesses.

77. Join a professional organization.

78. Plan your next holiday promotion.

79. Plan holiday gifts for your best customers.

80. Send birthday cards to your clients.

81. Approach a colleague about a joint venture.

82. Donate branded prizes for local fundraisers.

83. Become a mentor.

“Sales is not about selling anymore, but about building trust and educating.” —Siva Devaki, Co-Founder and CEO of MassMailing, Inc.7
Content Marketing

Providing entertaining content can attract people to your business, where you can then entice them to buy. But to transcend mere advertising, be sure to offer something useful and relevant to the reader or viewer.

84. Plan a free teleconference or webinar.

85. Start a podcast.

86. Submit a press release to local outlets or to communications services like PR Newswire.8

current high-yield savings account interest rates comparison,the balance money,headline_text,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/the-new-savings-account-that-can-help-you-save-on-travel-4843943,"With so many savings options, it’s hard to know which one to pick—especially in a low-interest environment. This is where having goal-specific savings accounts can come in handy. These can include a high-yield savings account for higher rates of return, a money market account for long-term savings, and an awards-focused account to help you build up miles for future travel.

Bask Bank recently came out with this type of savings account, and it could significantly change the way you think of saving for travel. Here’s what you need to know about Bask Bank’s new savings account.

Travel Rewards That Could Outpace Interest

Offering a unique type of return, the Bask Savings Account awards savers with American Airlines AAdvantage® miles rather than interest. As a result, savers can earn one AAdvantage® mile for every dollar they save annually, and that can translate into big travel awards over the course of a year. 

As an added bonus, Bask Bank is currently offering another benefit through Aug. 31, 2022. If you deposit and maintain a minimum daily account balance of $5,000 for 90 consecutive days out of the first 120 days following the initial account opening, you’ll earn 1,000 bonus AAdvantage® miles. This is a great way to kick off your savings, and it can help you quickly earn miles for a future trip.

Since miles are deposited monthly, having a Bask Savings Account means your miles never expire. You’ll be able to plan a trip whenever global circumstances allow for it, without having to worry about what will happen to the miles you’ve earned. 

The Ability to Overcome a Low-Interest Environment 

Interest rates have dropped significantly over the last few years but have bounced higher somewhat thanks to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to combat inflation in 2022. Interest rates on traditional savings accounts are still historically low, with the standard rate at 0.10% APY. This has affected both traditional savings accounts and savings vehicles such as CDs, making an awards-based account a better option for many savers.12

Note

The industry average annual percentage yield of 0.10% is based on the FDIC calculated national rate effective July 2022.2

To put this into perspective, if you were to have $60,000 earning the industry average of 0.10% APY in a traditional savings account, you would earn $60 over the course of one year. By comparison, in a Bask Savings Account, that same $60,000 would earn 60,000 AAdvantage® miles over the same time period (before factoring in any bonus offers). That translates into a much higher rate of return, making it easy to save on travel and to plan trips you may not otherwise have considered. 

The Flexibility to Make Your Savings Fit Your Lifestyle

In addition to helping savers earn AAdvantage® miles, the Bask Savings Account offers a unique way to upgrade your travel. This can be a great option for those looking to supplement their travel budgets and make their travel dreams a reality once current global circumstances allow for it. By offering a new way to maximize savings, Bask Bank is a great option for those looking for a new way to save that fits their lifestyle. 

With different types of savings accounts becoming more popular, being able to have goal-specific accounts can help you meet multiple goals at once while making saving a more rewarding experience. If you’re looking to maximize your savings while planning your next adventure, a Bask Savings Account could be right for you.


Disclosures
All Bonus Award offers are valid through Aug. 31, 2022. Terms and Conditions apply.
AAdvantage® bonus miles are awarded within ten business days upon meeting offer qualifications and may take 6-8 weeks to post to your AAdvantage® account.
The value of this offer will be reported to the IRS, and the recipient is responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes on this offer.
Bask Bank is a division of Texas Capital Bank. Member FDIC. The sum of your total deposits with (i) Bask Bank and (ii) Texas Capital Bank are insured for up to $250,000. Additional coverage may be available depending on how your assets are held.

EUGENIO MARONGIU / GETTY IMAGES

A nominal interest rate is one that does not adjust for inflation. You may see a nominal interest rate advertised for a product such as a mortgage or a high-yield savings account. A real interest rate is one that has been adjusted for inflation, to show the real cost and purchasing power of money that is lent or invested.

The nominal interest rate shows the price of money and reflects current market conditions. It may be influenced by the Fed funds rate or another benchmark rate. This nominal interest rate tells you how much money you will either pay (such as in interest on a loan) or receive (such as interest on a savings account). The real interest rate is what tells you how much purchasing power you as an investor or saver, or a lender, actually earns from that interest.

What’s The Difference Between Nominal and Real Interest Rates?
Nominal Interest Rates	Real Interest Rates
Not adjusted for inflation	Adjusted for inflation
Measures price of money and reflects current rates and market conditions	Measures purchasing power and shows how much you or a lender actually earned from interest paid

Simply put, the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. For example, if a nominal interest rate was 2% and the inflation rate was 1%, the real interest rate would be 1%.

Inflation

The nominal rate of interest is the rate available to consumers and businesses looking to borrow money or earn interest in an account. It continually changes as it’s influenced by monetary policy, investor sentiment, and other market conditions, including the expectation of inflation (but not actual inflation). For example, if an interest rate on a savings account is 0.4% and based on the Fed funds rate, it could increase to 0.5% if the Fed funds rate increased first.

Note

Interest rates offered by lenders, banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions vary widely and may also reflect their business strategies and expectations of profits.

Nominal interest rates already account for inflation expectations. If the Federal Reserve predicts high inflation, it may increase the target Fed funds rate, which impacts many other interest rates, such as those offered on mortgages, auto loans, savings accounts, and other financial products.

Since nominal interest rates are based on the expectation of inflation or deflation, it’s important to know about other products or investments that adjust for actual inflation. These products or investments show the real interest rate.1

The Federal Reserve publishes interest rates on its website daily.2 These rates are used as benchmarks for interest rates on savings accounts, mortgages, and more. They include the Federal funds rate; Treasury bonds, notes, and TIPS yields; and the average bank prime rate. There are also regular surveys of consumers and economists, and Federal publications of inflation expectations, which lenders and financial institutions incorporate into their rates.

Cost of Money vs. Purchasing Power

Nominal rates of interest represent the actual cost of money to businesses and consumers. They measure how much you pay or receive in interest, but not what that money can buy, also known as purchasing power. Here’s how that works.

Suppose you deposit $10,000 in a one-year certificate of deposit (CD). At the end of one year, the bank pays you 1% on top of the principal, so you receive $10,100.

In the beginning of that year before you deposit that money in the CD, your $10,000 could buy a basket of goods for $10,000, leaving you with $0. By the end of that year, after 1% inflation, that same basket of goods costs $10,100. When your CD matures, you have an extra 1% that you earned in interest, but you have nothing left if you use that money to buy that same basket of goods. Inflation canceled out your earnings.

Nominally, you had an extra $100 that you earned in interest on the CD. In reality, you have the same purchasing power that you had before because of 1% inflation over the course of that year. In this example, the nominal interest rate is 1% and the real interest rate is 0%.3

What It Means for Investors

When nominal interest rates are higher than inflation rates, real interest rates are positive. When nominal interest rates are lower than inflation rates, real interest rates are negative. This is important to understand when looking at interest rates on investments in comparison to current inflation rates.

For example, between March 2020 and December 2021, real interest rates as measured by the 10-year TIPS yield were negative.4 This is because when daily Treasury yield curve rates are below the expected inflation rate, TIPS yields fall into negative territory. When this happens and the real interest rate is negative, rather than earn interest on an investment in TIPS, you’d be paying money to hold the TIPS investment instead.

TIPS stands for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. They are investments that pay interest and adjust the principal based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). So if the CPI increases, the principal adjusts up, but if it decreases, the principal adjusts down.

Note

TIPS are available in five-, 10-, and 30-year maturities. TIPS pay interest twice per year on the adjusted principal. The greater of the original or adjusted principal is paid at maturity.1

So why would someone invest their money in TIPS?

In times of rising inflation, TIPS may seem like a relatively safe investment option. TIPS investments won’t meet investor expectations if inflation rates don’t rise to expected levels or if real TIPS yields are negative. However, despite negative real yields, some experts consider TIPS one of the easiest ways for investors to protect their portfolios from inflation over the long term.5

Another explanation could be uncertainty and the “flight to safety” phenomenon.6 You may be willing to pay a small premium for assets such as bonds or TIPS that have little or no risk to principal. You may consider this a safer choice than investing in stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the stock market during volatile or uncertain economic times.

Negative real interest rates such as the 10-year TIPS yield are unusual, but they do happen. Before 2020, the last time the 10-year TIPS yield went negative was in December 2011. They remained there until May 2013, when bond investors started selling bonds after Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke said the Fed would start tapering asset purchases. This caused a spike in interest rates, known as the “taper tantrum.” Since bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, this spike caused bond prices to fall.7

A similar announcement came in July 2021 when the Fed said that it would slow bond purchases toward the end of the year. This time though, there was no “taper tantrum” in response and yields remained about the same.4

Note

Negative real interest rates in the U.S. don’t happen too often. In the past, they have usually been a result of extraordinary interventions by the Fed.

The Bottom Line

Nominal and real interest rates are important because they play different roles in your financial decisions. If a real interest rate is positive, it means you have more purchasing power. If the real interest rate is negative (nominal rate minus the inflation rate), then it means you have less purchasing power—at least when it comes to investments and earning interest on your money.

When it comes to borrowing money, negative real interest rates may influence borrowers, such as potential homeowners who see low interest rates as an attractive time to buy, thus pushing up the demand for houses and their prices. At the same time, businesses may be more inclined to borrow money to finance projects or acquisitions. On the other hand, conservative investors may face difficult choices as to where to put their money.

Saving money doesn't have to be a numbers game; anyone can accomplish it with proper planning and discipline. Instead of putting off the practice until you reach certain milestones like that next raise, make saving a priority every day to secure your financial future. Follow these money-management tips in your daily life to watch the savings add up.

Key Takeaways
Build a money-management system by evaluating your spending and setting a budget.
Avoid comparing yourself to others and buying based on trends rather than need. 
Pay down debts using the avalanche method. 
Cut expenses by reducing dining out and preparing coffee at home. 
Save money by purchasing groceries in bulk and researching prices before you buy big-ticket items.
Build a Money-Management System

It's easy to blow through your paycheck if there's no rhyme or reason to your spending. Creating a systematic approach to everyday spending and saving through these tips can stretch your dollars further.

Evaluate your spending before building a budget. Document what you buy, where, and in which spending category for 30 days to gauge your spending habits. This approach will ensure that your budget is rooted in reality.
Set a monthly budget. Use budget spreadsheets, software, or old-fashioned pen and paper to plan incoming deposits and outgoing expenses. Once you have established a budget, exercise the discipline needed to stick to it.
Track your spending on an ongoing basis. Schedule a time and day each week to compare your actual spending against your budget to avoid overspending, and realize opportunities to save any extra incoming deposits.
Pay for day-to-day expenses with cash. Evaluate your budget, and determine spending categories you can switch to cash-only payments (for example, entertainment or dining). Whereas credit card payments can tempt you to make impulse buys, cash helps you stick to your budget, because you can't spend any money you don't have.
Note

You can use debit cards in lieu of a cash-only budget if you keep the amount on the card low enough that you can't overspend.

Change Your Mindset About Money

Even with a budget in place, you're liable to slide back into bad money habits if you don't alter your day-to-day spending philosophy. These saving tips can help you replace negative spending behaviors with positive ones.

Don't play the comparison game. Stop ""keeping up with the Joneses"" or with anyone else. Let your budget alone guide your spending and saving habits.
Try to curb emotional spending. Avoid the temptation to buy yourself a ""treat"" when you're upset. When these feelings arise, redirect them toward other positive behaviors that don't require spending money, such as calling a friend or exercising.
Delay gratification. When you get the urge to make an impulse buy, evaluate whether you need or only want the item. If you determine that you need it, wait for one full day before buying it to see whether the item in question still appeals to you.
Don't buy according to trends. Instead, buy what is meaningful to you rather than the highest-priced fad item; you'll be more discerning about your spending, which can save you more money every day.
Pay Down Your Debts

Whether it's a sky-high credit card balance or a bank loan, debt can eat into your cash reserves and make it more difficult to keep up with day-to-day expenses and to save. These debt-management tips encourage you to pay off what you owe so that you can keep more of what you earn.

Pay off debts as soon as possible. This habit can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest over time.
Consult with creditors. If you're in credit card debt, call your creditors and ask them whether they can lower your APR (interest rate).
Pay down your remaining debt using the avalanche method. This approach involves paying the minimum payment on each account and then taking any remaining funds and paying extra on the account with the highest interest rate. High-interest debt can substantially eat into your everyday spending money, so it's prudent to pay it off quickly. The feeling of accomplishment you will get from paying off one debt can motivate you to make progress on other debts.
Set debt-payoff deadlines. Mapping your debt-payoff goals with amounts and a timeline can help you track your progress, remain accountable for actually paying off the debt, and visualize how good it will feel to make that final debt payment.
Consider refinancing your home loan. If you own a home, try to lower your monthly payments by refinancing your mortgage at a lower interest rate.
Note

If you're paying pricier private mortgage insurance (PMI) and think you have enough equity to waive the PMI, call your lender to start that process. In general, you can request PMI cancellation when your mortgage balance drops below 80% of the original home value.1

Insource Everyday Spending

There are many errands you might outsource now but that you could do yourself to reduce living costs. Follow these tips for saving money on day-to-day expenses:

Reduce or eliminate dining out. Cooking more—or all—meals at home can easily save you $100 or more per month.
Prepare coffee at home. Brewing coffee at home instead of buying a three-dollar cup of coffee at a local coffee joint every day can save you over $1,000 a year.
Do your own personal grooming. You'll save a little every month if you skip the trip to the nearby salon to have your hair cut by a stylist or your nails done by a manicurist, and do them yourself (or with the help of a family member or friend). If you cut your hair every other month, you can easily save $250 per year or more in professional hairstylist fees alone.
Clean your car at home. Washing your car on your driveway instead of visiting a drive-through car wash can save you $180 to $360 a year.
Avoid professional dry cleaners. You can save $720 per year in dry-cleaning costs if you switch to wearing machine-washable wrinkle-free shirts.
Adjust Your Shopping Habits

From groceries to gasoline, some purchases are unavoidable. Fortunately, you can save money on day-to-day expenses by using these tips:

Buy in bulk. Buy your groceries in bulk at wholesale stores, including Costco or Sam's Club. Prepare a meal plan once a week so that you buy only what you need.
Shop secondhand. Explore garage sales, thrift stores, eBay, and Craigslist for items you need.
Buy less. When you buy at retail stores, buy fewer items, and focus on purchasing higher-quality items. You'll find over time that quality items actually cost less per use than lower-priced items, because they last much longer and often have classic designs that don't go out of style.
Compare prices. Look up prices online before buying something at a store to determine whether another store sells the same item at a lower price. When shopping online, always check for and use coupon codes.
Borrow instead of buying. Items that you don't need to own to enjoy can be borrowed from friends or neighborhood resources. For example, you can use the library instead of the bookstore to pick up recent books.
Note

Bundling your errands into one long trip per week allows you to save on fuel costs.

Reduce Recurring Costs

Ongoing services such as cellular service or utilities often charge you based on the features you choose or your usage, so they can quickly put a dent in your wallet without your knowing. Use these daily money-saving tips to minimize these repeat expenditures:

Pare down or cancel your cable/satellite TV packages. You can save a bundle every month by switching from your current 500-channels cable package to streaming content providers, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu. If you're not ready to cut the cord, consider switching to a cable package with fewer channels.
Reduce cell phone minutes or data. If you're on a prepaid cell phone plan, change to a plan with the lowest amount of minutes you need. If you're on a postpaid plan, scale back on the data amount. Set an automatic calendar reminder on your phone to check your minute or data usage a few days before the bill is due. That way, you can minimize your usage if needed and avoid overage charges.
Plant trees to reduce cooling bills. Station shade-giving trees around the perimeter of your house to save on the costs of air conditioning during the summer.
Plug appliances into a power strip. Flip the strip's switch off whenever you're not using one of those appliances. You'll save on the cost of ""phantom energy,"" which is the slow drain of energy that stems from keeping things plugged in.
Reconsider that gym membership. Join a gym only if you'll use your membership regularly. There are endless free fitness opportunities, including running, walking, and cycling in your local park.
Tweak the thermostat. Keep your home a little hotter in the summer and a little colder in the winter. Don't feel the need to go overboard; turning the thermostat down by even one degree in winter can yield an energy savings of 1% if the temperature is maintained for eight hours.
Improve the efficiency of your heater. Put an insulation blanket over your water heater to prevent heat from escaping. While you're at it, caulk or weather-seal gaps around your doors and windows to reduce heating bills.
Service and maintain your car. Repairs can easily recur if you don't. Protect your investment.
Get bank account fees waived. Traditional banks charge monthly account-maintenance fees, which can draw down your balance by small amounts over time. However, these fees can often be waived by meeting a certain minimum account balance or minimum monthly deposit. Check the fee schedule so that you can determine how to waive fees.
Save Money in the Future

Whether it's buying a car or deciding where to bank, big financial decisions that you make today can often impact your wallet for months or years. Follow these money-saving tips to make more well-informed choices about where your earnings go:

Go online to spend less on vacation. Use Airbnb or other lodging-rental sites to find vacation rentals for less money than traditional hotel accommodations.
Buy a more fuel-efficient vehicle. Although the fuel savings will help you recover what you paid for the car over time, you can also sell or trade your gas-guzzler to immediately recoup part of the costs. If you live in an area with good public transit, commute on the subway or the bus, or consider becoming a one-car family.
Keep appliance documentation. If you buy a new appliance, keep the warranty certificate (or at the very least, the receipt) in an envelope or file folder that is organized by store or by month. If anything breaks, you'll have proof that your appliance is still under warranty, which could save you hundreds or thousands in repair costs.
Choose a high-interest bank account. Your bank savings account or CD should pay decent interest so that the money in your account earns more over the year. Online banks tend to offer higher interest rates than brick-and-mortar banks do. Interest is important, because it represents free money that grows in your account while you sleep, allowing you to meet your financial goals even sooner.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What kind of savings account earns you the least amount of money?

A standard savings or checking account will earn you the least amount of interest on your savings. The average interest rate for a savings account is less than 0.1%, which means it's unlikely that your interest earnings will keep up with inflation. Checking accounts also yield less than 0.1% on average, even when accounting for high-yield checking accounts.2

Why is saving money important?

Saving money provides financial stability, which can prevent debt spirals in case of unexpected charges, and it can also provide emotional comfort to try out a new career path. It doesn't matter whether you're cutting back on expenses or setting aside more of your income, the key is that you have greater financial flexibility to adapt to life's curveballs.

Savings accounts let you deposit and withdraw as much money as you want, typically whenever you want (some banks restrict certain types of withdrawals to six per month). A no-penalty CD is often seen as a way to earn a slightly higher interest rate than with a savings account, but in turn, you're much more limited as to when you can make deposits and withdrawals. If you're trying to decide between the two, we'll help by highlighting some important differences.

What’s the Difference Between No-Penalty CDs and Savings Accounts?
 	SAVINGS ACCOUNTS	NO-PENALTY CDS
APY	Usually slightly lower	Usually slightly higher
CHANGING APYS	Can change at any time	Does not change 
LIMITS ON DEPOSITS	No limits; whenever you want, in any amount	Once open, you can’t deposit any more money
LIMITS ON WITHDRAWALS	Six withdrawals per month, in any amount	No withdrawals are allowed until the term ends or you make an early withdrawal
AVAILABILITY	Available at any bank or credit union	Less commonly available
APY: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

Both savings accounts and no-penalty CDs are usually some of the lowest-yield accounts at banks and credit unions. The interest rates on no-penalty CDs are often a tad higher than with savings accounts, however.

If earning the best rates on your savings while keeping it readily available is your goal, look for an online bank or credit union. The difference between the rates that online and brick-and-mortar financial institutions offer is generally larger than the difference between interest rates on savings accounts and no-penalty CDs within the same bank.

Changing APYs: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

One of the benefits of a traditional, fixed-rate CD is that once it's open, the rate doesn't change (unless you have a bump-up CD or a step-up CD).1 This can be handy if you think rates are high now but will go down soon. It lets you lock in a better rate today than you might get in the future with a savings account.

If you have a savings account, on the other hand, your rate can change at any time.2 If rates go down, you'll earn less interest—but if rates go up, you'll earn more.

Limits on Deposits: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

There are no limits on savings accounts for how often you can make deposits, or how much they have to be. Still, it's good to be aware that some banks have minimum balance limits. These tend to be more common on higher-yield savings accounts. If you're a super-squirreler, it's also good to keep your savings account balance below $250,000, the limit for FDIC insurance.3

When you open a no-penalty CD, on the other hand, it's meant to be a hands-off savings account. Once you open the account, you can't make any additional deposits until the account is closed, either because its term ended or you withdrew the money early. At that point, the only thing you can do is open another CD.4

Limits on Withdrawals: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

No-penalty CDs are much more restrictive when it comes to withdrawals. You can only make one withdrawal, and when you do, you must withdraw the entire CD balance. Normally, CDs charge you an early withdrawal penalty, but with a no-penalty CD, you don't have to pay this fee.5

Savings accounts, on the other hand, are more flexible. You can make up to six withdrawals per month for the most common types of withdrawals, which include things such as ACH transfers, bill payment services, and overdraft protection transfers.6 When you make these withdrawals, you can withdraw any amount you want, from one cent all the way to your entire balance.

Note

The monthly limit of six withdrawals per month from a savings account has been suspended due to COVID. As of publication, it hasn't been reinstated yet.7

Availability: Savings Accounts vs. No-Penalty CDs

Savings accounts, along with checking accounts, are the twin pillars of any person's financial toolkit. You can find checking accounts and savings accounts at just about any bank or credit union.

If you're interested in a no-penalty CD, however, you'll have to look a bit harder. Since they're a bit more unique, they're not offered at every bank or credit union. If you want to keep all your bank accounts with the same institution, look for a bank that offers a no-penalty CD first. Otherwise, you may need to open a separate no-penalty CD account with a different institution than your everyday bank.

Which Is Right for Me?

Savings accounts and no-penalty CDs are great ways to save, and determining which one is best for you depends on your financial goals and intended usage. Here are some questions to ask yourself that can steer you toward one option or the other:

Do I have a lump sum of money I won't need for a bit? Since you can't make regular deposits and withdrawals from a no-penalty CD, a savings account would be a better option if you're still working on saving up.
Do I want to lock in my rate now? If you think rates will be going down soon, a no-penalty CD can allow you to lock in the rate that's currently being offered for a bit longer.
Do I want the most convenient option? You'll need to search a bit more to find a no-penalty CD, and chances are you'll have to open it at a different bank than the one that houses your traditional accounts. If you don't want that hassle, choose a savings account.
Do I want to earn the most interest and still have access to my money? No-penalty CDs usually offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, but this isn't always the case.
Best-of-Both-Worlds Option

You don't necessarily have to choose between a savings account and a no-penalty CD. You can open both types of accounts if you wish.

If you've already built up enough savings to meet the minimum opening requirements for a no-penalty CD, you can open this account and let it sit while you keep making regular deposits to your savings account. When your no-penalty CD matures, you can roll it over into a new one with the savings you've built up in the meantime.

The Bottom Line

You're not alone if you're trying to figure out how to earn the highest rates of return from your savings while still having access to your cash. It might be worth considering other options, such as money market accounts or even CD ladder strategies, which tend to offer higher rates.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Which offers higher rates—a no-penalty CD, or a savings account?

Often, no-penalty CDs have slightly higher interest rates than savings accounts, but that's not always true. Sometimes, they're the same. Online banks and credit unions generally offer much higher rates on both savings accounts and no-penalty CDs than brick-and-mortar banks.

What's the difference between a savings account, a CD, and a no-penalty CD?

A savings account lets you deposit and withdraw money without restrictions. With a CD, you can't deposit more money or make withdrawals until its term is over, unless you pay an early withdrawal fee. If you do, you have to withdraw the entire balance, even if you don't need it all. No-penalty CDs waive the early withdrawal penalty, but they often offer slightly lower rates than regular CDs.

Certificates of deposit (CDs) and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) can help you earn money with your money. However, IRAs are long-term investment accounts that offer tax advantages and help you fund your retirement, whereas CDs are usually short-term investments that provide modest returns and mature after five years or less. Learn more about the differences between a CD and an IRA, and when you might choose one over the other.

Key Takeaways
CDs is a kind of savings-style account that typically have terms of five years or less and earn low interest rates.
IRAs are retirement accounts that are more complex than CDs.
You can deposit more into a CD in one year than you can in an IRA.
CDs can work for short-term savings goals, but IRAs tend to be a better fit for a long-term retirement plan.




What’s the Difference Between IRAs and CDs?
 	CD	IRA
Account type	Specialized savings account	Retirement investment account
How it works	You deposit a fixed amount of money for a set term to earn interest.	You hold investments such as bonds, stocks, and exchange-traded funds in the IRA and receive tax advantages.
Terms	One month to five years	Withdrawals before age 59½ often incur a tax penalty
Types	Traditional CD, high-yield CD, market-linked CD, jumbo CD, liquid CD, IRA CD, brokered CD, add-on CD	Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, payroll deduction IRA, SIMPLE IRA, self-directed IRA
Early withdrawal penalties	Yes, in most cases	Yes, in most cases
Minimum deposits	Depends on institution	Depends on institution
Maximum deposits	Depends on institution	Yes, set by IRS each year
Federal insurance coverage	Yes, up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution	Yes, up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution
Tax benefits	No	Yes
Income limits	No	Yes, for some IRAs
Account Type

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of savings account in which you deposit a fixed amount of money for a fixed term to earn interest. An IRA is a retirement account that offers tax advantages and can hold a variety of investments, which can include CDs, stocks, bonds, and more.

How It Works

With a CD, you earn interest by leaving your deposit in the account for a set period, known as a term. When the account matures, or reaches the end of the term, you get your deposit back plus the interest your money earned.

An IRA acts as a basket that holds your investments, which can include CDs, stocks, bonds, and more. However, you can’t hold life insurance or collectibles in an IRA.1 You’ll let your investments grow until you retire, when you’ll begin to make withdrawals from your IRA.

Terms

CDs have terms that usually range from one month to five years or longer.2 With most kinds of CDs, you generally can’t access your money until the end of the term.

Because IRAs are designed as retirement savings accounts, you’ll need to wait until you’re at least age 59½ to withdraw money. You can withdraw funds before that age, but early distributions may be taxed and you may pay a 10% penalty fee.3

Note

You’re typically required to start taking withdrawals from a traditional IRA when you reach age 72.4

Types

Both CDs and IRAs come in a variety of types. The main types of CDs include:

Traditional CD: Traditional CDs have fixed terms and guaranteed interest rates if you keep your deposit in the account until it matures.
High-yield CD: High-yield CDs are like traditional CDs, but offer higher-than-average interest rates.
Market-linked CD: Instead of offering a fixed interest rate, a market-linked CD offers a variable rate based on market measures such as commodities or indexes.
Jumbo CD: Jumbo CDs require a large minimum deposit, such as $100,000.
Liquid CD: Also known as no-penalty CDs, liquid CDs don’t have early withdrawal penalties, so you can access your money before the end of the term without incurring a fee.
Brokered CD: Brokered CDs are sold by financial intermediaries instead of directly by banks or credit unions.
Add-on CD: Add-on CDs allow you to continuously add funds to your CD throughout your term.
Note

You might also come across an IRA CD, which is a CD held in an IRA.

IRAs also come in a range of options:

Traditional IRA: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, and your qualified distributions are taxed at the time of withdrawal.
Roth IRA: With Roth IRAs, your contributions aren’t tax-deductible, but your qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
SEP IRA: A SEP IRA is a Simplified Employee Pension plan that lets business owners contribute to retirement plans for themselves and their employees.
Payroll deduction IRA: Payroll deduction IRAs enable employees to have their IRA contributions automatically deducted from their paychecks.
SIMPLE IRA: A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA is a plan that lets employers and employees contribute to traditional IRAs for employees.
Self-directed IRA: Self-directed IRAs let you invest in a broader set of assets than traditional IRAs.
Early Withdrawal Penalties

Penalties for an early withdrawal apply to both CDs and IRAs. With CDs, you’ll often face an early withdrawal penalty if you remove money from the account before the maturity date. For example, a bank may charge you three months of interest if you withdraw money from the CD.

If you withdraw any amount from an IRA before turning 59½ years old, you’ll often be charged a 10% tax penalty and be required to include the distribution in your gross income.5

Minimum Deposits

Both CDs and IRAs can have minimum deposit requirements. However, these will depend on the financial institution you choose.

Maximum Deposits

The bank or credit union issuing your CD will limit how much you are allowed to deposit. For example, a bank might allow you to deposit up to $2 million, not including interest.6

When it comes to IRAs, deposits are limited by the IRS, which sets a maximum contribution limit each year. In tax year 2022, you can’t contribute more than $6,000 if you’re under 50 years old, or more than $7,000 if you’re 50 or older. Those limits are $6,500 and $7,500 in 2023.7

Note

You can’t contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year. Depending on your type of IRA, your filing status and income may also result in a reduced contribution limit.7

Federal Insurance

Both CDs and the accounts held in IRAs can be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA) up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. That means deposits owned by the same person at the same bank or credit union are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. IRAs and savings accounts (such as CDs) count toward separate $250,000 totals.8

You may notice that $250,000 is less than the maximum deposit allowed by some financial institutions. That means any deposits over $250,000 wouldn’t be insured.

Tax Benefits

Traditional CDs don’t come with any special tax benefits. Any interest you earn counts as taxable income in the year you receive it.

IRAs offer tax advantages that vary based on the type of IRA you choose. For example, traditional IRA contributions may be partially or fully tax-deductible, and you’re only taxed when you withdraw money in retirement. Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible, but qualified distributions are tax-free.

Income Limits

Issuers of CDS don’t typically have any income limits for depositors.

However, with Roth IRAs, your contribution limit can be affected by your income and filing status. For example, if you’re married filing jointly and made $214,000 or more in tax year 2022, you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA that year.9 While contributions to traditional IRAs aren’t limited by income, tax deductions on contributions can be reduced or disallowed if your income is above a certain amount, and you or your spouse are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Which Is Right for You?

If you’re looking for a long-term investment plan that will help you save for retirement, and you don’t have a 401(k) from your employer, an IRA is a good solution. It allows you to gradually save over the years while, generally speaking, earning more interest than you can get from CDs.10


Once you turn 59½, you can begin to take withdrawals without any penalties. You’ll get the most out of an IRA if you start investing early in life, qualify for the full tax deductions on your contributions, and make the maximum allowed contribution each year. However, the contribution limits cap the amount you can invest, so your IRA can only grow so much.3

CDs offer a shorter-term investment option with lower returns but fewer limitations. If you have funds you’d like to keep more liquid but still want to grow, you can turn to CDs with terms from one month to five years. CD laddering is a popular strategy in which investors buy a mix of short- and long-term CDs to improve liquidity while maximizing interest rates.

The Bottom Line

CDs and IRAs can both play important roles in your investment strategy. IRAs are great plans to put into place as part of your long-term retirement savings. Meanwhile, CDs can help you earn interest on a shorter-term basis.


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is an IRA or CD better?

It depends on where you're at in life. If you're looking for a long-term investment that you can use when you retire, IRAs are typically the better choice. If you want a short-term, risk-averse investment, then CDs are a good fit.

What is the difference between a CD and an IRA account?

CDs tend to have low APYs and terms that typically range from a few months to five years, although terms can be longer. IRAs are retirement accounts with more complex rules and tax benefits. Generally speaking, IRAs earn more over time than CDs.

benefits of high-yield savings accounts vs traditional savings accounts,the balance money,headline_text,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-an-interest-checking-account-315272,"PHOTO: FG TRADE / GETTY IMAGES
DEFINITION

An interest checking account is a type of checking account that earns interest on your account balance.

Key Takeaways
An interest checking account accrues interest on your account balance.
Standard interest checking accounts offer less interest but fewer requirements and a simpler interest structure, whereas rewards checking accounts offer more interest in exchange for more requirements and a more complex interest structure.
These accounts can be opened online or in person at banks or credit unions but may require a check of your ChexSystems report.
Definition and Example of an Interest Checking Account

An interest checking account is a checking account that accrues interest on the money in it. As long as the requirements to earn interest are manageable, the interest benefit of these accounts gives savers an opportunity to grow their deposits on autopilot. The interest is usually expressed as an annualized rate known as ""annual percentage yield"" (APY). It's calculated as a percentage of your balance and paid out periodically.

Alternate name: Interest-bearing checking account

For example, if you deposit $10,000 in an interest checking account with a 0.20% APY, after a year of savings you'll earn an extra $20.00.1

How an Interest Checking Account Works

Traditionally, checking accounts are not interest-bearing accounts as savings accounts are, as they’re designed for short-term cash that you’ll spend soon. Savings accounts are better-known for earning interest, but these accounts ordinarily limit how often you can make certain withdrawals from the account.

Interest checking accounts, available from banks and credit unions, incorporate key features from both of these account types. You can use them as standard checking accounts; they come with a debit card for purchases, checks for spending, automatic electronic payments, and online bill payments. All the while, you'll earn interest on your balance as with a savings account. This interest rate is applied to your balance and paid out according to the terms in your contract with the bank or financial institution.

The catch is that you'll sometimes need to pay a higher monthly fee and maintain a minimum account balance to earn that interest in comparison to what you'd pay for a standard checking account.2 However, some interest checking accounts, usually online-only accounts, impose none of these requirements.

For example, suppose that ABC Bank offers up to 0.60% APY on its interest checking account but not on all balances. It offers 0.60% APY on balances of $25,000 and above, 0.30% on balances between $10,000 and $24,999, and only 0.20% on balances below $10,000. In addition, you need to maintain an average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid a $15 monthly fee. You'll need to maintain a minimum average monthly balance of $15,000 to avoid fees, but you'll need to keep another $10,000 in the account to earn the top rate.

Note

The interest you earn on these accounts is subject to taxation.

Types of Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts fall into one of two categories:

Standard interest checking accounts
Reward checking accounts
Standard Interest Checking Accounts

These accounts are available at both brick-and-mortar and online-only banks and credit unions and pay less interest but impose minimal requirements.

Requirements to earn interest: You'll typically earn interest simply by holding deposits that meet the institution's threshold for earning the stated APY.
Interest structure: Some pay the same interest rate on all balances, whereas others pay a higher rate as your balance increases, as in the earlier example of ABC Bank.
Fees: Potential fees include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and foreign ATM fees.

Capital One 360 Checking, Ally Interest Checking, and Citi Elevate High-Yield Checking are all examples of this type of interest checking account.

Rewards Checking Accounts

Sometimes called ""high-yield"" or ""high-interest checking accounts,"" these accounts usually pay a more competitive APY than standard interest checking accounts—sometimes even higher than long-term certificates of deposit (CDs)—as a reward for meeting more stringent requirements. In addition, they're harder to find—community banks and credit unions are your best bets.

Requirements to earn interest: Common requirements for earning the lucrative APY on these checking accounts include the need to use your debit card a certain number of times per month (and in some cases, for a certain purchase amount each time), receive one or more direct deposits or ACH payments each month, enroll in online banking, and receive electronic bank statements.3
Interest structure: These accounts often come with a tiered interest structure, meaning that you'll earn the top rate on balances of up to a certain amount and a lower rate beyond that balance. If you don't meet the requirements in a given month, you'll typically earn interest at a lower rate. For example, a bank might offer up to 4% APY on its rewards interest checking account but only offer the top rate on balances of up to $3,000, 2% on balances between $3,000 and $10,000, and only 0.10% on balances above $10,000.
Fees: The upside of these accounts is that they often impose no minimum balance requirement or monthly fee. However, they're still subject to other common fees, such as overdraft and foreign ATM fees.

The Consumers Credit Union Reward Checking Account and Elements Financial Credit Union High Interest Checking Account are examples of this type of account.

Note

To meet the required number of debit card transactions each month to earn the top interest rate, consider setting up recurring purchases such as gift cards or small donations to charities.

Interest Checking Accounts vs. Money Market Accounts

While not technically checking accounts, money market accounts are similar accounts that may serve as an alternative for consumers who seek an attractive APY without the tougher requirements of a rewards checking account.

INTEREST CHECKING ACCOUNT	MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT
More rules to earn interest on rewards accounts	Fewer requirements to earn interest
No withdrawal limits	Traditionally imposes withdrawal limits
Better for everyday spending	Better for emergency savings or occasional spending

In terms of account features, money market accounts are similar to standard interest checking accounts; you generally only need to keep qualifying deposits in the account to earn interest, which might be the same at all balance tiers or yield more interest as your balance increases. Monthly maintenance fees can apply.

These accounts fall under the category of savings accounts but typically pay more than traditional savings accounts. In addition, they often pay more interest than standard interest checking accounts but less than rewards checking accounts.

Money market accounts typically offer a debit card and check-writing privileges. However, check writing is more limited, as are external transfers, as money market accounts, like savings accounts, have traditionally only allowed consumers to make six withdrawals per month.4

Note

The withdrawal restriction was lifted in April 2020 but may still apply at some financial institutions. Inquire with yours for the latest rules.5

As such, money market accounts are a good fit for emergency funds but aren't designed for everyday spending. Interest checking accounts don't limit withdrawals in this way, making them more suitable for frequent check writing.

How to Get an Interest Checking Account

You can open an account online, or, if the financial institution has branches, in person. Simply search for the institution online to find and visit its website.

When you apply for an interest checking account, you'll be asked to provide some form of government identification, personal information such as your Social Security number, and an opening deposit (if required).

Many institutions will reference your ChexSystems report, which details your past deposit account activities, when deciding whether to approve or deny your application.6 If approved, you can register your account for online access and will receive your debit card in the mail.

Establishing a savings strategy is one of the most important things you can do to create financial security. Whether you’re just getting started or you’re a long-term saver, having a thoughtful plan can make a big difference. 


Interest rates are another key factor. Although they have reached historic lows since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve recently announced that they’re likely to go up over the coming months.1 This could make growing your savings easier, and offer a higher rate of return. Below, we share some tips on how to maximize your savings as interest rates begin to rise.


Set Attainable Savings Goals

A great way to make the most of your savings is to set specific goals. These can be more general (such as establishing an emergency fund) or more specific (such as setting aside enough money for a down payment on a home).


When establishing your goals, it’s helpful to ask yourself a few questions:


What are your biggest financial priorities?
Do you have an emergency fund that can cover unexpected expenses?
Do you need your savings to be easily accessible?


Your answers to these questions will help you determine your needs and create savings goals to match. Once you’ve established your top priorities, we recommend listing out how much you’d like to set aside to meet them. 


For example, if you’re saving for a vacation, you can make your savings goal the full cost of your trip and then break it down into weekly or monthly targets. This is a great way to make saving feel more achievable and ensure that you’re putting aside enough money to cover all of your needs.


Focus on Optimizing Your Savings

Although interest rates are projected to rise steadily over the next few years, it’s important to note that this will happen gradually. Focusing on long-term growth can be an effective way to develop your savings strategy while also meeting your savings goals.


Where you decide to keep your savings can also have a big impact on how those savings will grow over time. Popular options include traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and brokerage accounts. While each has its advantages, some also carry disadvantages including higher levels of risks and a lack of liquidity.


Here are a few key things to know about each type of account: 


Traditional Savings Accounts: Often a go-to option, traditional savings accounts are a reliable way to grow savings with a modest interest rate. 

High-Yield Savings Accounts: Like traditional savings accounts, high-yield accounts provide a safe way to increase savings and generally offer a substantially higher interest rate. These types of accounts can be found through both traditional and online banks, and they offer a strong rate of return along with ease of access. One key thing to note is that high-yield savings accounts can also come with fees and may require a minimum balance, so it’s important to weigh your options if you decide to open one. 

CDs: With slightly higher interest rates, CDs can be a good option for those who are interested in longer-term vehicles. Typical terms range from six months to 18 months, though longer terms are also available. It’s worth noting, however, that CDs have less liquidity and carry penalties for withdrawing money early. 

Brokerage Accounts: For those looking for even longer-term options, brokerage accounts offer a way to access a range of investment options including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. While this type of investing often carries higher returns, it also comes with a higher level of risk, and withdrawing money can be tricky if you don’t time the market right.

Choose a Savings Vehicle That’s Right for You

Depending on your circumstances, it’s likely that a certain type of savings option will suit your needs more effectively than the others. If you have a longer time horizon, a brokerage account or CD can both be solid choices. If you’re looking for easier access to your funds or the ability to minimize the risks associated with investing, a high-yield savings account can often provide more benefits.


When choosing a high-yield savings account, it’s important to consider both the interest rate and the institution offering it. With a highly competitive interest rate of 5.00% Annual Percentage Yield and the ability to open an account in minutes, the Bask Interest Savings Account from Bask Bank is a great option. It also has zero minimum balance requirements and zero monthly account fees. What’s more, there is no cap on the amount of interest you can earn, so the more you save, the more you earn.


If you’re interested in other ways to maximize your savings, Bask Bank also offers the Bask Mileage Savings Account that earns 2.5 American Airlines AAdvantage® miles for every $1 saved annually. They also make it easy to seamlessly transfer money between the two accounts so that you can earn interest while also earning miles to put toward the cost of upcoming trips. 


Above all, making the most of your savings requires a careful approach. By having a clear understanding of your needs and focusing on long-term growth, you can achieve your goals and increase your financial security.

Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is accurate as of July 31, 2023. APY is variable and subject to change at any time without notice. No monthly account fees or minimum balance requirement. Must fund within 15 business days of account opening.

When your savings account pays almost nothing in interest, it's smart to explore alternatives. Changing banks for a higher rate can help you grow your cash faster, but make sure you'll come out ahead before you go to the trouble of switching banks.

Key Takeaways
Earning interest helps you maintain purchasing power by growing your cash.
Switching banks might make sense, but it's smart to run the numbers first to see if it's worth it.
If you decide to switch banks, read the fine print and be prepared for your rate to change.
Banks and credit unions offer a variety of products that might pay more than your savings account.
Why Do People Switch Banks?

Your bank or credit union is a safe place to keep idle cash, and interest earnings make your money grow. Banks lend your savings to other customers, allowing them to earn revenue off your money. In return, they pay you a portion of what they charge, which encourages you to keep your money on deposit.

However, banks differ in the interest rates they offer. Some banks, such as smaller banks, are competing for your deposit funds and are willing to offer a higher interest rate. Other banks may not need to attract customers the same way and offer less interest on your savings.

Banks also differ in the fees they charge and the account minimums they require to open or maintain a bank account. If your bank charges high fees and pays little interest, it makes sense that you'd want to switch to one that charges low fees and pays more.

The annual percentage yield (APY) tells you how much you earn on your savings, expressed as a yearly return. That number can help you compare banks; the higher the APY, the better (all other things being equal).

As of June 2022, the average APY at banks nationwide is 0.08%, but you can certainly earn more than that.1 Some of the best savings accounts pay 1.60% APY or more. Alternatively, if you open a certificate of deposit (CD) for at least one year, you can earn over 3% APY with some institutions. To put that in context, assume you have $5,000 in savings:


At 0.08% APY, you earn $4 per year
At 1.60% APY, you earn $80 per year

That's a big difference, and that's why it's important to earn a competitive rate on your savings. Online banks often have relatively high rates, and some community banks and credit unions also compete for your savings.

Note

To help you find accounts easily, we created a list of the best savings accounts with weekly rate updates.

How To Decide if Switching Banks Is Worth It

When does it make sense to pursue a higher rate on your savings? Several factors can help you decide.

How Much Do You Have To Save?

One of the most important considerations is your account balance. If you have a substantial amount in savings, the rate matters more. For example, as with the example above, assume you can earn an extra 1.52 percentage points on your savings at a different bank. If you have $5,000 in savings, you'll get an extra $76 per year by switching, assuming rates don't change. But with $45,000 in savings, your earnings increase by $684.

Ultimately, you have to decide if chasing rates is worth your time. For $76, it might or might not be worth the effort of filling out an application, transferring money, and getting familiar with a new bank. But for $684, the higher rate becomes more appealing. Some of the other factors below can help finalize your decision.

Minimum Deposit Requirements

The size of your account balance might also determine which accounts are available to you. For example, as of June 2022, Customers Bank paid 1.00% APY on balances of $25,000 or more in the Ascent Money Market account.2 But you earn nothing if your balance falls below that level, so it's crucial to read the fine print and choose banks that are a good fit for your finances.

Promotional Periods

Sometimes banks advertise unusually high rates to gather new deposits, but the rate is a promotional rate that will drop after a limited time. In those cases, at least you receive advance notice that the teaser rate won't last forever. Examine the footnotes and read all bank disclosures carefully whenever you're thinking of opening an account.

Likelihood of Rate Changes

Banks change their interest rates regularly. The Balance tracks banks and credit unions with the best interest rates, and if you do the same, you'll notice that the top-ranked banks change positions frequently. If you choose a bank because it has the highest rate, you need to prepare yourself for this reality: You won't have the highest rate for long, and your rate may eventually become downright unimpressive. How willing are you to change banks if your bank stops competing for deposits?

Balance Caps and Tiered Rates

Look closely at how banks pay interest on your balance. You earn an extraordinarily high rate in some cases—but caps and tiers can limit your earnings. For example, as of June 2023, SmartyPig paid 3.85% APY on your first $10,000. After that, you earn lower rates on subsequent, larger tiers.3 If you have a substantial amount in savings, do the math to figure out how much you'll actually earn after taking your entire balance into account.

Should I Switch Banks To Get a Higher Rate?

Now that you know the issues, here's when it makes the most sense to go for a better interest rate:

Your current bank pays almost nothing.
The difference in interest earnings—in dollars, not just the APY—is worth the time and effort required to switch.
You're comfortable opening accounts and transferring money to new banks.
You have the time and energy to monitor rates at your bank and competing institutions.
You're willing to change banks repeatedly if necessary.

It's important to keep in mind that even small fees can quickly eat away at any small differences in APY that you may get from banks—consider ATM fees, incoming wire fees, maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and also the cost to drive to a new, perhaps less-conveniently-located bank.

Switching Account Types Instead of Banks

If you're looking to earn more on your cash, alternative savings vehicles might pay more on your money.

If you can lock up your savings for an extended period, a CD might pay more than your savings account. Banks often pay higher rates on CDs in exchange for your commitment to leave the money untouched.

Some money market accounts pay attractive rates, too, as do rewards checking accounts, so include those options in your search. Just be sure to compare the requirements, fees, and minimums of any accounts you're considering.

LEOPATRIZI/GETTY IMAGES

Prospects for another stimulus package might be driving economic growth forecasts higher, but some economists are warning to be careful what we wish for. Flooding the country with cash will likely push up consumer prices, and perhaps to levels that could have wide-reaching downsides, they say.

Key Takeaways
Another federal stimulus package would flood the country with cash again, potentially driving inflation up too much too quickly, some economists are warning.
While inflation is benign right now, if it accelerates too much, it could force the Federal Reserve to change course and even possibly increase benchmark interest rates sooner than expected.
Inflation fears have pushed up 10-year Treasury yields and weighed on benchmark stock indexes.
The Federal Reserve continues to offer reassurances, with Chairman Jerome Powell saying inflationary conditions ""don't change on a dime.""

The fear is that inflation could rise too quickly and by too much once people are able to spend freely again. They'll be armed with lofty savings, on top of additional government checks. And there's the pent-up desire to get out of the house and live again after almost a year of staying home.

Together, that could ignite buying activity more than the economy is ready for, particularly if the pandemic is still creating supply shortages, some economists and analysts say.

“It’s a perfect cocktail for inflation,” said Tom Essaye, a trader and founder of Sevens Report Research, a markets research firm.

A Chain of Events

A surge in demand, plus a weakening U.S. dollar and higher commodity prices, could indeed mean we’ll soon be paying measurably more at the register, but perhaps more important is the chain of events it would set off behind the scenes.

Last week, yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries reached their highest level since the pandemic began, and that’s precisely what makes Essaye and others nervous. These yields rise in anticipation of higher inflation because inflation erodes the return on the bond payments.

Yes, stimulus checks and additional unemployment benefits are viewed by many as necessary to make sure the country can weather the next few months, but what will happen if the Federal Reserve starts to see some serious inflation risks?

Could that force the Fed to taper asset purchases that began as part of a concerted effort to restore jobs lost to the pandemic and get more normal levels of inflation? Or worse, would the Fed increase benchmark interest rates faster than it has said it would? (Right now, the forecast is to leave them at virtually zero until at least 2023 as the Fed temporarily targets an average inflation rate of “moderately above 2%” rather than its regular 2% target.) 

That could in turn dampen the heavily rate-sensitive housing and stock markets—two of the economic bright spots in the pandemic era. Mortgage rates have begun to rise from their historic lows in recent weeks. And just in the last few days, worries about the rising Treasury yields made a dent in benchmark stock indexes that not that long ago had been on a stimulus-inspired upswing.

“A significant rebound in inflation in the next year or two could potentially derail the recovery” if the Fed is “spooked” into raising rates sooner or higher than expected, Wells Fargo economists Jay Bryson and Sarah House wrote in a special commentary about “poking the inflation bear.""1

Reassurance From the Federal Reserve

For the Fed’s part, Chairman Jerome Powell has downplayed the risks, offering reassuring words about the “transient” nature of any upward pressure on inflation and promising to use its tools if inflation reaches an “uncomfortable” sustained level.

Inflationary conditions ""don't change on a dime,"" Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing last week.  ""We don't see how a burst of support or spending that doesn't last for many years would actually change those inflationary dynamics. If it does turn out unwanted inflation pressure arrives, we have the tools to deal with that.""2 

In January, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 1.4% higher than a year earlier, excluding energy and food prices that tend to be more volatile. This core inflation rate is well below the 2% to 2.5% range it stayed within for the years leading up to the pandemic.

Economists who are sounding alarm bells about what might fan inflation aren’t actually predicting huge leaps in this core rate, though they’re leaving room for things to change. 

Wells Fargo economists, for instance, forecast core inflation of 2.0% for this year and 2.5% for 2022, but say those could be underestimations. Some economists predict it will accelerate earlier in 2021 before retreating a bit. Many aren’t quantifying a worst-case scenario, pointing out supply shortages should ease.

“The second half of this year is going to be the question,” Essaye said. “The Fed is changing policy it has had for the last 20 years—letting inflation run hotter than it has in the last 20 years—and the federal government is unleashing stimulus like we haven’t seen since World War II, and there is no war.”

The Prospect of More Stimulus Checks

President Joe Biden's administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal includes another round of stimulus checks—this time for up to $1,400 per taxpayer—and a higher federal supplement ($400) to weekly unemployment insurance benefits. 

Just a third round of stimulus checks alone could boost personal incomes by a combined $413 billion, lifting spending and adding to abnormally swollen savings accounts, according to BMO Capital Markets senior economist Sal Guatieri. Households have already boosted their savings $1.7 trillion over pre-pandemic levels—enough, if it was converted to spending, to cover three years worth of growth in spending at normal pre-pandemic growth rates, he said.

The expected surge in spending underpins forecasts for some pretty sizable economic growth. Economists at BMO, for instance, raised their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to 6% from 5% this year, and at ING, to 6.5% from 5.2%, citing the expected passage of Biden’s stimulus package. Oxford Economics predicts the pending stimulus and a burst of spending will fuel growth “above 7%.” For perspective, annual GDP growth averaged 2.3% in the 10 years leading up to the pandemic.

Meanwhile, benchmark stock indexes including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to new record highs in February, and then retreated a bit as 10-year Treasury yields rose on inflation fears. The yield on the 10-year, which heavily influences borrowing rates for mortgages, auto loans and student debt, has jumped almost a full percentage point from its pandemic low, and at 1.42% on Tuesday, remains sharply higher than the 0.93% seen at the start of the year.

Other Contributing Factors

There are other factors beyond stimulus contributing to inflation fears. Higher commodities prices (think gold, oil, corn, and cattle) are making goods more expensive, as evidenced by a 13% increase in the Refinitiv/CoreCommodity CRB Index this year alone. Oil prices have also rebounded since last spring. And then there’s the weaker U.S. dollar, which makes imports—everything from Apple phones to BMWs—more expensive.

But the core question is what, if anything, will prompt the Federal Reserve to act. While moderate inflation is a natural byproduct of a growing economy, and the Fed says it sees any spikes from pent-up demand as transient, could that change?

Consider, for instance, a second measure of core inflation: the year-over-year change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, excluding food and energy prices. This inched up to 1.5% in January from 1.4% in December, and according to BMO’s Guatieri, is higher than the core CPI rate of 1.4% for the first time in a decade. 

This will “catch the Fed’s attention, though it’s still a long way from moving above the 2% target,” Guatieri wrote in a commentary on Friday. 

Indeed, not everyone feels reassured by Powell, the Fed chairman, given the unprecedented times. Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, said Biden’s plans for a huge stimulus package risks causing an inflation outbreak.

“We have no experience with fiscal stimulus like that under consideration and the impact on inflation expectations,” he wrote in a Feb. 7 opinion piece for the Washington Post.3

While money market funds work well for parking your surplus cash, several worthy alternatives exist, some of which offer more ideal terms and yields depending upon your specific needs and investable assets. In brief, a money market mutual fund is a type of account that invests in low-risk securities and generally offers lower returns than other market funds. Investors like them because they tend to offer predictable, short-term returns.

The alternative that best fits your situation depends upon several factors, including how accessible you want your funds to be and the amount of interest you'll receive for your investment size. Here are some alternatives to money market funds to consider.

Key Takeaways
Alternatives to money market mutual funds include high-yield savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs, bonds, and bond funds.
Savings accounts offer safety. Your deposits are fully insured up to $250,000 per institution.1
CDs and bonds are essentially a loan to an entity in exchange for payments in the form of yield.
Bond funds are debt securities grouped into a single investment product, in theory, diversifying the investment and reducing the risk of default.
High-Yield Savings Account

It might sound old-fashioned, but sometimes nothing beats a simple savings account. Savings accounts generally pay fairly low interest, especially when compared to other options on the list, but there are banking services that specialize in offering high-yield accounts.

These accounts are also easy to open and convenient to use. Banks often have low minimums to open an account. You'll have instant access to your funds, and you can access those funds in a variety of ways, such as through an app, at an ATM, or, in the case of brick-and-mortar banks, at your local bank branch.

When it comes to safety, your money can't be safer than it is in a savings account. Your savings account deposits are fully insured up to $250,000 per institution.1 Even if your bank goes out of business and shuts its doors, your money should be safe.

Money Market Deposit Account

Although people often get the two accounts confused, a money market deposit account works differently than a money market mutual fund. A money market deposit account, typically offered by banks and credit unions, more closely resembles a savings account.

Some money market deposit accounts even offer check-writing privileges and other features similar to a regular bank account. While this type of account yields higher interest than a bank savings account, it also usually carries a fairly substantial minimum balance requirement.

Certificates of Deposit

Certificates of deposit (CDs) are fixed-income investments that involve depositing or ""lending"" money to the issuing bank for a predetermined length of time in exchange for a fixed yield—typically between three months and 10 years.2 In general, the longer you are willing to lock up your money, the higher the interest rate you'll receive. Once the predetermined time has passed, you'll receive your money back along with the yield earned during the lifetime of the CD.

Depending upon your chosen maturity date, CDs may yield more or less than other options on this list. As with savings accounts, CDs are insured by the FDIC up to the in-effect limits, though you can often extend those limits to as high as $1.25 million through the use of techniques like using payable-on-death designations.34

Note

There will likely be downsides to withdrawing money from a CD before its maturity date. The specifics will depend on the institution you use, but you can expect to pay some kind of penalty in exchange for breaking the terms of your CD.5

Individual Bonds

Like CDs, bonds are essentially a loan to an entity in exchange for payments in the form of yield.6 However, unlike with CDs, your money isn't insured. If you lend money to a business in the form of a bond and that business goes under, you may or may not get your money back—it depends on how the bankruptcy plays out.

Note

A bond can be issued by a variety of entities, including governments, municipalities, and companies.

However, some types of bonds are generally regarded as some of the safest investments available. Perhaps the safest of the safe bonds are issued by the federal Treasury Department. You can open an account with the Treasury through a service known as TreasuryDirect.

A TreasuryDirect account makes it easy to invest your money into Treasury bills, notes, and bonds issued by the government. As such, they are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal U.S. government.7

Bond Funds

As opposed to individual bonds, which are single debt securities with single entities, bond funds are bundles of debt securities grouped into a single investment product.8 In theory, this helps diversify the investments and reduces the risk of any single entity defaulting on the bond.

Funds are available with a variety of objectives. There are riskier bond funds that invest primarily in corporate bonds. There are safer bond funds that invest primarily—or entirely—in Treasury bonds.

Note

Bond funds have unique benefits and risks compared to individual bonds. One risk to consider is that a bond fund has no set maturity date on which you're guaranteed to get your initial investment returned.

When it comes to bond funds, you have two primary options: mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Just like with stock mutual funds and stock ETFs, the differences between bond mutual funds and bond ETFs are subtle, but careful investors will notice some key differences.

Bond Mutual Funds

The major difference between the two funds is that mutual funds aren't actively traded on exchanges.9 Their prices don't fluctuate throughout the day. When you place an order to buy a mutual fund, your order—and any other buy orders submitted in the same period—will trigger simultaneously at a set time of the day (typically as the fund's net asset value is recalculated). This means you have less control over the exact price you'll get, but you know it'll accurately reflect the holdings in the mutual fund.

Bond ETFs

Bond ETFs seek to combine capital preservation (methods of securing money) with maximum liquidity (ability to convert an asset to cash quickly). You purchase shares in a bond ETF through a broker rather than a mutual fund company.

Bond ETFs are traded on the open market like stock, which means you can buy them on margin or sell them short. It also means that the value of the fund fluctuates throughout the day and may not exactly reflect the underlying value at all times of the day.

However, for active traders, the ability to trade at will throughout the day is a major benefit over mutual fund alternatives. ETFs also typically have lower fees than comparable mutual funds, but that isn't guaranteed.

The Big Picture

There are multiple differences between each of the savings and investment instruments covered here, and it's important to note that financial institutions may offer their own variations of these products. It's always wise to learn about all the features of an account before you decide to invest or deposit your money, but a few key features are highlighted in the chart below to help you compare on a high level.

	Basic Structure	Notable Benefits	Downsides
Money Market Mutual Fund	Account that invests in multiple low-risk securities	High liquidity and lower risk than other securities	No guaranteed return
High-Yield Savings Account	Simple deposit account with instant access	Insured by the FDIC up to $250,000	Low interest
Money Market Account	Deposit account with limited withdrawal options	Higher interest rates than standard bank accounts	Minimum balance can be high
Certificates of Deposit	Fixed-investment accounts with interest rates variable by term	Insured by the FDIC	Penalties for early withdrawal
Individual Bonds	Loans in exchange for yield	Generally regarded as safe (especially U.S. Treasury Bonds)	Not insured by the FDIC
 Bond Funds	Groups of debt securities that come in many forms	More diversity and investing breadth than single bonds	No set maturity date or guaranteed return
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Can money market funds lose money?

Money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC, and there is no guarantee of principal, so it is possible that you can lose money in this type of fund.10 However, money market funds invest in relatively safe securities and aim to keep the net asset value (NAV) steady at $1, so investment decisions tend to be prudent.

What's the difference between a money market fund and a money market account?

A money market fund is an investment in multiple money market instruments, where your money is subject to the investment decisions of a fund manager or entity. A money market account is a simple deposit account at a bank that earns interest at a higher rate than standard bank accounts based on higher deposits, limited access, or other controlled features.

Which type of fund or account gives the highest returns?

Generally speaking, money market funds, bond funds, and simple deposit accounts covered here are known to be safe. These are not typically used to make major gains. Instead, they provide slow, steady growth or predictability. That said, money market funds, bond funds, and CDs offer higher interest rates than standard deposit accounts, and longer terms may come with higher interest rates. Your returns will ultimately depend on your initial investment, the interest rates of the product, and how long you are willing to let it grow.

Investing, essentially, is putting your money into something with the hope of a financial return, and it's one of the best ways to build wealth and save for your financial goals, from retirement to your dream home. While most people start investing as adults, investing as a teen can give you a head start on saving for the future and learning vital money lessons.

Investing may sound complicated, but getting started is easier than you'd think (yes, even for teens). In this article, parents and teenagers will learn the benefit of investing for teens, the best investments for this age group, and what accounts you can use to start investing.

Key Takeaways
Investing as a teen gives you an opportunity to grow even more wealth thanks to compound interest and also gain financial literacy skills from a young age.
Some of the best investments for teens include high-yield savings accounts, CDs, stocks, bonds, and pooled investments.
A custodial account is one of the most popular ways to start investing for teens, though a custodial IRA is also a great option for a working teen.
Why You Should Help Your Teen Start Investing Early

Individuals who start investing as teens rather than waiting until later in life have an advantage over their peers, both in their potential returns and the knowledge they can gain from investing.

""Age is arguably a younger investor's most valuable asset. This is because of compound interest, or the ability of your money to start earning its own money,"" Taylor Jessee, a CPA and CFP and the director of financial planning for financial consulting firm Taylor Hoffman, shared. ""The earlier you start investing, the longer you'll have your money being put to work for you.""

Let's take a look at an example. Imagine a 15-year-old who starts investing $150 per month into a brokerage account with a 10% annual return. If they were to invest just $150 per month until age 60, with compound interest, they would have more than $1.3 million saved. On the other hand, someone who started investing the same amount at age 35 would have less than $180,000 by age 60.

Note

The money that your teen earns in their investment account can help them pay for college, buy a home, start a family, travel the world, start a business, and more.

Investing as a teen helps young adults prepare financially for the future. It also helps teach them financial literacy. For many, personal finances are a source of stress and anxiety. A 2018 National Financial Capability Study from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that 53% of Americans consider their finances to be a source of anxiety, with respondents ages 18 through 34 reporting the highest levels of stress.1 By helping your teen build their financial literacy from a young age, you may help them feel more confident and less anxious about money matters later on.

What Teens Should Invest In

With so many investments to choose from, all of which have varying levels of risk, it can be difficult to know where to start investing. Below are some of the most common investments available to teens as well as some of the downsides you should be aware of.

High-Yield Savings Accounts

A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is the most basic way for a teen to start earning a return on their money. Savings accounts have been around for a long time, but more financial institutions now offer high-yield savings accounts, which offer a higher interest rate than a standard account. With a higher interest rate, your funds will grow more than they would in a typical savings account. However, even savings accounts with high yields have very low rates of return compared to other investments.

Note

There's no risk to putting your money in an HYSA. The money is insured for up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).2

Certificates of Deposit

A certificate of deposit (CD) is a banking product similar to a savings account through which a teen can earn interest from their savings. The key difference is that CDs require you to keep your money in the account for a specific period of months (or even years) to earn the promised interest rate. Then, when you redeem the CD at maturity, you'll get your money back in addition to the interest your account earned.

Like savings accounts, CDs are considered a risk-free investment because the money is insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000. The downside, however, is that your money is essentially locked up for a period of time.3

Stocks

A stock is a way to take a piece of ownership—also known as ""equity""—in a publicly traded corporation. When you own a stock, you become a shareholder and part-owner of the company. Investors can earn money from dividends that companies pay to their shareholders as well as through capital gains when the value of the stock increases.

""You could take a small piece of your portfolio and pick one or two stocks as a way to learn how to follow and evaluate individual stocks,"" Jessee said. ""Consider picking one or two companies you're familiar with, so it's easier to follow and relate to.""

Note

For parents and guardians, Jessee recommends adding stocks to your child's portfolio as a complement to more diversified investments rather than building a portfolio entirely of individual stocks. Stocks tend to be volatile assets, meaning they can undergo major price shifts in a short period of time.

Before adding stocks to your teen's portfolio, you can work together to open a virtual trading account—also known as ""paper trading""—where you can practice buying and selling stocks without real funds. Virtual trading can give your teen an idea of how the stock market works without putting any money at risk.

Bonds

A bond is a type of debt security. When you purchase a bond, you're essentially lending money to the issuing company or government entity. While bonds might not necessarily be as exciting to a teen as stocks, they're generally more stable investments, meaning they help create a well-diversified portfolio. Bonds usually provide a fixed income from the interest payments the bond issuer makes throughout a set period of time.

Funds

Funds, primarily mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are popular investments that allow you to gain exposure to many different securities in one investment. Mutual funds and ETFs are known as ""pooled investments"" because they pool together the money of many investors.

Mutual Funds: A mutual fund is technically a type of investment company that pools the money from many investors to create a well-diversified portfolio. Each investor is part owner of the fund, with a share in its profits and losses. All mutual fund orders are settled at the end of the trading day, regardless of when they were placed.
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): An ETF is another type of pooled investment that allows investors to add many securities to their portfolio through a single investment. One key difference between ETFs and mutual funds is that ETFs trade throughout the day like stocks. Like a stock, you can buy one share of an ETF and have more control over the price. ""I usually recommend starting with an index ETF or mutual fund, so you get immediate access to a diversified portfolio instead of putting all your eggs in one basket with just one stock,"" Jessee said. ""This makes even more sense if you're starting out with a small dollar amount to invest.""
Opening an Investment Account for Teens

If your child is under 18 years old, the most effective way to start investing for or with them is to open a custodial account. With this type of account, an adult ""custodian"" opens an account and can save and invest money on behalf of the child. Then, when the child reaches adulthood—either 18 or 21, depending on the state—they'll take full control of the account.

""Keep in mind, assets in a custodial account legally belong to the child—the account beneficiary,"" Jessee said. ""The parent or custodian is merely a placeholder until the child reaches legal adulthood. This means that if a parent puts money in a custodial account for a child, it is considered an irrevocable gift and cannot be taken back. In other words, that money now belongs to your child.""

There are two common types of custodial accounts: Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts. The two are almost identical but vary in the types of assets they can hold. UGMA accounts can hold financial assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash. UTMA accounts can hold all of those same assets as well as physical assets like real estate.4

Note

Another type of custodial account is a custodial individual retirement account (IRA), which allows teens and their parents to start saving for retirement before they reach adulthood. Similar to a UGMA or UTMA account, an adult custodian opens the IRA on behalf of a minor. Then, the family can contribute up to the child's earned income for the year or up to $6,000, whichever is less, as of 2022.5

The Bottom Line

Most people understand that they should be investing, but many may not have considered the benefit of investing for or with their teens. Getting teens started with investing at a young age can help them build wealth and financially prepare for the future as well as provide them with the financial literacy they will need to succeed later in life.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How old do you have to be to invest in stocks?

Investors under the age of 18 are generally prohibited from opening their own brokerage accounts.6 However, adults can open a brokerage account on behalf of a child of any age, allowing them to get a head start on investing. Keep in mind that even in the case of a custodial account, the adult custodian, not the child, has control of the account and the investment decisions.7

Who pays taxes on custodial accounts?

Because the assets in a custodial account legally belong to the child, they're subject to the tax rules that govern children's unearned income (informally known as the ""kiddie tax"").

Under the kiddie tax, the first $1,150 of a child's unearned income is exempt from federal taxes for 2022. The next $1,150 is taxed at the child's tax rate, which, assuming the child has little to no income, will likely be the lowest tax bracket. Finally, any earnings above $2,300 are taxed at the parents' tax rate.89

DEFINITION

A high-yield savings account is a savings account that pays interest rates that are higher than those on traditional savings accounts.

A high-yield savings account is a savings account that pays interest rates that are higher than those paid on traditional savings. Depositing your money in a high-yield account can help you save more.

A high-yield savings account can be a good option if you’d like to save for a house, car, home improvement project, or another long-term goal. They are often offered by online banks that have lower overhead costs, which allows them to pass the savings on to customers in the form of higher interest rates. But traditional banks and credit unions may also offer high-yield savings accounts.

Let’s say you deposit $10,000 into a traditional savings account that pays an interest rate of 0.01%. You’ll earn $1 in interest after one year. You'd earn $50 in the same time period if you put the money in a high-yield savings account that pays an interest rate of 0.5% instead.

Note

Shop around to compare the terms and yields on high-yield savings accounts so you can find the right one for your needs. Learn about minimum balance requirements, fees, and other features.

How a High-Yield Savings Account Works

The specific features of high-yield savings accounts can vary by financial institution. Depending on the account you open, you could see benefits such as no minimum balance requirements, free transfers, no monthly maintenance fees, or online account management and digital banking tools.

Other than providing a better rate of interest, high-yield savings accounts can work very similarly to traditional savings accounts. You deposit money and ideally let it grow, but you can access it and withdraw it without penalty, at least to a reasonable extent.

Pros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts

Consider all the advantages and drawbacks before you open a high-yield savings account.

Pros

Earn more interest

Low risk

No additional fees

Cons

Fluctuating interest rates


Not ideal for long-term wealth

Withdrawal limits

Pros Explained 
Earn more interest: A significant benefit of a high-yield savings account is the high interest rate you can earn on the cash you stash. You’ll get more return on your money.
Low risk: The FDIC will insure deposits of up to $250,000, including those held in high-yield savings accounts.1
No additional fees: Many high-yield savings accounts have no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements. But some do charge fees, so it’s important to read the fine print before you commit.
Cons Explained
Fluctuating interest rates: The interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable. They can change at any time and are dependent on the economy.
Not ideal for long-term wealth: A high-yield savings account can help you with short-term no savings goals, but it’s not ideal for long-term investing. Other accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs are typically better options for saving for retirement because they come with tax advantages and offer the potential for larger gains.
Withdrawal limits: You can access your money in a high-yield savings account, but you’re often limited to a certain amount of withdrawals before you have to pay a fee.
Can You Lose Money in a High-Yield Savings Account?

No investment or savings option is 100% without risk, but high-yield savings accounts definitely fall on the safe side. High-yield accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for deposits up to $250,000. Your money will be insured up to that limit regardless of what’s going on with the economy.1

But this isn't to say that the economy can't have an impact on your money. The FDIC essentially insures against bank collapse, not sinking interest rates. Of course, you won't lose the money you've saved if rates plummet, thanks to the FDIC. But you won't be earning the interest rate you expected, either.

Note

Keep in mind that the interest you do earn, small or significant, is taxable income, according to the IRS.2

Key Features To Look For

As with any other financial product, it can pay to compare offerings from various banks and financial institutions because not all high-yield accounts are identical in terms and conditions. Of course, you'll want to look for the best, highest interest rate, but make sure your access to your money is reasonably unfettered as well.

Alternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts

Other investment options have the potential to earn even more than high-yield accounts. Consider these alternatives:

Certificates of Deposit (CDs): A CD requires that you tie up your funds for a specific period of time until you reach a maturity date. This can be one year or as long as five years. You get a higher, guaranteed interest rate in return.
Individual Retirement Account (IRA): IRAs are designed for retirement savings goals. They come with early withdrawal penalties, but they can help you save more than a high-yield savings account depending on how you invest. An IRA also has tax advantages.
401(k): A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. It allows you to save for retirement with tax advantages, just like an IRA. Employers will often match your 401(k) contributions. You can open a solo 401(k) if you’re an entrepreneur or self-employed.
Money Market Account: A money market account is essentially a high-yield savings account that has some of the same features as a checking account. You can access the money you save there with a debit card or a check as often as you’d like.
The Bottom Line

Opening a high-yield savings account is straightforward and similar to the process of opening a checking or traditional savings account. You’ll fill out an application online or via a mobile app in most cases. You'll provide some basic personal information, including your name and Social Security number, as well as information from your government-issued ID, such as a driver’s license or passport.

Most banks and credit unions that offer high-yield savings accounts will perform a soft inquiry into your credit rather than a hard inquiry when you open an account. Your credit score is not affected by a soft inquiry.

That's it. Start depositing your money and saving toward that goal you have in mind.

Key Takeaways
A high-yield savings account usually has a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account so your money can grow at a faster rate.
Many high-yield savings accounts don't charge monthly fees or have minimum balance requirements.
Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts include CDs, IRAs, 401(k)s, and money market accounts, but you may face early withdrawal penalties with some of these options.

Debt relief program costs range from 14% to 25% of your settled debt amount, according to our analysis of a sample of five debt settlement companies. You may also be charged for maintaining a dedicated account for the program.

It’s important to understand that debt relief companies, also known as debt settlement companies or debt elimination programs, may leave you with more debt than you started with. And there are other risks to consider besides the cost of a debt relief program. We’ll cover what you need to know about debt relief program costs and alternatives.1

Key Takeaways
Debt relief programs cost between about 14% and 25% of the total debt amount, not including account maintenance fees.
Debt settlement companies can negotiate with creditors to settle your debt for less than you owe.
Penalties and fees from nonpayment on unsettled accounts may sometimes surpass these savings, leaving you deeper in debt. 
Working with a debt relief company may significantly harm your credit score.
Alternatives to debt settlement include debt consolidation and nonprofit credit counseling. 
What Is a Debt Relief Program?

A debt relief program is a process by which a debt relief or debt settlement company attempts to negotiate with your creditors to settle your debt for less than you owe. During the program, the debt relief company will typically request that you stop all credit card payments. This can result in late fees, collection attempts (including lawsuits against you), and damage to your credit score.1 

The debt relief company may also require you to deposit money into a dedicated account to fund your debt settlement. There may be fees for maintaining the account. You may make monthly payments into the account for three to five years or more.2 

The average debt relief program customer has their debt for settled accounts reduced by 32% after fees, according to a report commissioned by the American Fair Credit Council.3 However, the debt relief company may not be successful with all your accounts. Fees and penalties can build up on unsettled accounts, which can surpass the savings you receive from the accounts that are settled successfully. 

Some debt relief companies are scams. Never work with a company that charges upfront fees, since this practice is illegal. The company must disclose the costs, risks, and timeline for debt relief before charging you anything.4

Note

Beware of companies touting a “new government program” or those that guarantee they can eliminate your debt, as these are red flags that indicate a scam. 

How Much Does Debt Relief Cost?

Debt relief companies may charge between 14% and 25% of your settled debt amount, according to The Balance's analysis. Legitimate debt relief companies use a performance-based model, meaning you only pay after the company settles some portion of your debt.

Fees vary depending on where you live, how much debt you have, and other factors. You also may pay fees for keeping a dedicated account, which is typically managed by a third party. Below are the disclosed fees from five of the best debt relief companies. 

DEBT RELIEF COMPANY	FEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR SETTLED DEBT
New Era Debt Solutions	14% to 23%
National Debt Relief	15% to 25%
Freedom Debt Relief	15% to 25%
Pacific Debt Relief	15% to 25%
Accredited Debt Relief	15% to 25%
Note

Legitimate debt relief companies do not charge consultation or enrollment fees. If you are asked for upfront payment and guarantees to wipe out your debt, report the scam to your state Office of the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission. 

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

You should only consider working with a debt relief company after you’ve exhausted all your other options.

If debt consolidation won’t work because of your credit score or debt amount, and if you can’t afford the monthly payments for a debt management plan, Chapter 7 bankruptcy may be a better option than debt settlement. That’s because it takes less time, stops debt collection calls and lawsuits, and can eliminate or significantly reduce your debt obligation. 

However, if you don’t meet the eligibility requirements for bankruptcy, or if you don’t want bankruptcy to show on your credit report, you may consider a debt relief program. Just make sure you’re aware of the dangers of debt settlement. 

Alternatives to Debt Relief
Debt management plan: A nonprofit credit counseling agency can negotiate lower interest rates and fees for your debts. You’ll typically make one monthly payment to the agency, which will distribute the funds to your creditors. This is known as a debt management plan. Credit counseling can also help you create a budget and avoid debt in the future.5 
Debt consolidation: Debt consolidation involves combining your debts into one monthly payment, either by taking out a new loan or by taking advantage of a balance transfer offer. The goal is to get a lower interest rate to save money. For example, you can use a low-interest personal loan or home equity loan to pay off your credit card debt, leaving you with one monthly loan payment. Or, you can transfer your debt to a credit card with a 0% introductory period. But in either case, you’ll likely need good credit to qualify.6 
Debt avalanche method: The debt avalanche method is the fastest way to get out of debt on your own, without applying for new credit. It involves making minimum payments on all your debts and devoting all the extra cash you have to the debt with the highest interest rate. Once that debt is paid, you move onto the debt with the next highest interest rate.7 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy: Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a legal process by which you can erase many of your debts. Filing Chapter 7 stops collection efforts. Your creditors will have a chance to ask you questions, and your non-exempt property will be sold to pay off your debts. You must meet certain requirements, but people earning below the median income in their area tend to qualify. Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for up to 10 years.89 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy: Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to keep your property and make the payments your budget will allow for over three to five years. After that, most remaining debts are erased. Filing also stops collection efforts. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is open to people who make more than the area median income, but it takes longer than Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It stays on your credit report for seven years.810 
Note

You can try to negotiate with your creditors yourself if you don’t want to enroll in a program. You might offer them a lump sum to settle your debts or negotiate a lower interest rate. Some credit card companies may offer repayment plans that make the debt easier to handle. 

Debt Management vs. Debt Settlement/Relief

Debt management plans are offered by nonprofit credit counseling agencies that charge low monthly fees, while debt relief programs are offered by for-profit companies that charge 14% to 25% of your settled debt.

While credit counselors negotiate your rates and fees with your creditors, debt relief companies ask you to stop making payments. This can hurt your credit and even result in lawsuits. For this reason, a debt management plan is often a better option.1112 

	DEBT MANAGEMENT PLAN	DEBT RELIEF PROGRAM
Debt reduction	Only reduces interest rates and fees	May reduce what you owe
Debt consolidation	Make one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency	Make payments to the debt relief company over time
Credit score impact	May improve your credit score with on-time payments over time	Negatively impacts your credit score
Other repercussions	Typically stops collection efforts	May result in calls from debt collectors or lawsuits
Cost 	Free consultation followed by low monthly fees 	14% to 25% of your settled debt, plus account management fees, if applicable
Tax implications	None	May owe taxes on your forgiven debts, depending on your situation
Frequently Asked Questions
How long does debt relief last?

It typically takes three to four years to complete a debt relief program. During this time, you accumulate funds in a dedicated account while the debt relief company negotiates the amounts you owe with your creditors.13

How does debt relief affect your credit?

Debt relief programs negatively affect your credit score. That’s in part because you’ll stop making payments and accrue a higher debt balance initially. Your payment history and credit utilization both impact your credit score significantly.

How much debt is too much?

There are many different opinions about how much debt is too much, but most financial advisors and lenders agree that spending 43% or more of your gross monthly income on debt repayment means you have too much debt. Most financial experts say you should aim to keep your debt-to-income ratio below 20%, which means that you don’t spend more than 20% of your gross income on debt repayment, not including your mortgage payment.14

What qualifies for debt relief?

Each debt relief company has different requirements. For example, they may have credit score requirements, debt-to-income ratio requirements, proof of hardship requirements, or minimum debt amount requirements.

ECHO / CULTURA / GETTY IMAGES

Money is a cause of conflict in many marriages. Managing your finances can be especially difficult when your spouse has conflicting ideas about money or won't even take part in the discussion to begin with. When one spouse doesn’t want to participate in financial planning, it can be frustrating for both partners—and could cost you in the long run.

It doesn’t help matters if your spouse thinks you are nagging or hounding them about money all the time, and you don't want to let your finances ruin your marriage. 

So, how do you improve the situation? Let's explore a few of the most common problems and solutions.

What's the Problem?

To start, it helps to get to the root of what’s causing the money tension. For example, your spouse may refuse to combine finances if they have underlying fears or more serious financial issues that you are not aware of.

Differing ideas about how to spend money, organize a budget, use credit, and tackle other financial goals have also caused issues in many marriages. Approaching financial issues with your spouse in a non-accusatory way and keeping things simple can help you make progress as a team.

Take the time to sit down with your partner and try to find out the ""why"" behind their reluctance. Once you understand where they're coming from, you can work together to solve the problem.

Note

If the situation is too tense, consider sitting down with a third party who can mediate and help you both remain calm and focused.

The Problem: Spouse Doesn’t Want to Budget or Plan

If your spouse understands the need to plan but just doesn’t want to, or they hate following a budget because it seems like too much work, it can be difficult to get them on board. Sticking to a budget is hard enough when you're committed to it, let alone when you’re not completely sold on the idea to begin with. For the sake of household harmony and financial health, though, it’s important to come up with a solution that will work for both of you.

The Solution: Create a Basic Plan for Review

Make it easy for your spouse to participate in the discussion. Come up with a basic budget that covers bills like groceries, utilities, and gas. Then talk about how you will choose to spend your discretionary income on expenses such as eating out and shopping, what your individual spending money should be, and other typical expenditures.

To make things very simple, you may even consider switching to a cash budget. You can break the money into weekly amounts to make it easier to get used to. That way, when the money is gone, both you and your spouse have to stop spending. In this scenario, you won’t have to worry about nagging your partner to stick to the budget. Plus, some people feel their spending more when actually handling cash and seeing it leave their wallet, rather than using a debit card, an online banking app, or a spreadsheet full of numbers.

This approach can take some of the pressure off of you and eliminate fights about every expenditure. At the end of each month, go over the budget and actual spending to see how you both did.

The Problem: Feeling Blamed in Discussions

If you're in a bad financial situation with a lot of debt or you seem to have a hard time sticking to a budget, the way you are approaching the issue may make your spouse feel like you blame them.

This can be a delicate situation—especially if you do feel that they are to blame for your financial troubles. However, it doesn't improve the situation if you place blame, no matter how deserved you feel it is. Blame makes your spouse feel defensive and less likely to participate in money discussions and stick to a budget. It will also cause you to approach the situation with a negative mindset, instead of a can-do attitude.

The Solution: Change Your Approach

Change the way you approach talking about money. Stop using blame, and don't focus on the past.

Instead of looking back, focus on what you can change moving forward and set up baby steps or milestones to track your progress toward your money goals. Try using phrases like, “Let's work together to get out of this situation.”

Ask your spouse to help create and commit to a plan that will improve the financial situation for both of you. With this approach, your spouse may be more willing to get on board and work together to improve your financial situation.

Note

Reorienting your approach to a positive one diffuses any negativity and allows you to work toward a more positive future.

Problem: Not Being Involved or Resentment Over Being Told What to Do

While you may think you have a reluctant spouse who does not want to plan, you may actually be dealing with someone who does not feel involved in the process.

Ask your spouse if they would like a more active role in the budgeting and planning. If they say yes, then you may benefit from changing the way you approach the situation by sharing some of the financial responsibilities with them.

Often, one spouse feels like the other is controlling all of the spending decisions, making them feel like a child rather than an adult in the situation. This may be especially true if one spouse gives the other an allowance.

The Solution: Start Over

Fix this problem by including your partner. If your spouse doesn’t feel involved in the process, maybe it’s time to start the process over and do it together as a team. Take care to avoid being bossy, condescending, or otherwise making your spouse feel like they're somehow less integral to the process than you are.

Gather your actual bills and list your expenses and income together. Go over monthly expenses, your budget, and your financial goals. When looking at your budget, get your spouse’s take on how you should spend your remaining monthly income. Once they see the numbers in black and white, they may be more willing to stick to a budget or curb their spending.

Plus, once they are involved in the process, they will be much more likely to participate in future budgeting and money discussions, since they had a say in the original plan.

Problem: Belief That Everything Will Work Out Somehow

When your spouse is holding onto the belief that everything will work itself out naturally, you may have a difficult time getting them to participate in the discussion. Many personality types are much better at being flexible in the current moment but not great at planning for the long term. These personalities often feel that if they keep working hard, everything will just somehow work out. The truth is, financial success comes when you make a solid plan and stick to it.

The Solution: Give Your Spouse a Reality Check

This may sound harsh, but the best way to handle this is to provide your spouse with a reality check. Talk about goals or desires that they have expressed in the past, such as owning a home or traveling during retirement years.

Compare these goals directly to your current financial situation. Put together an estimate of the level of savings you need to accomplish and demonstrate to your spouse whether or not you will achieve that goal at the rate you are operating now. Through this process, you may be able to get them on board with a monthly budget discussion and a financial plan. Sometimes it takes seeing the hard facts to wake someone up to the reality of the situation and help them get inspired to take action.

Tips for Better Money Discussions With Your Partner
Set a specific date and time for a discussion
Use inclusive language
Avoid placing blame
Focus on shared goals
Listen carefully to your partner
Remain calm
Invite a third party if necessary
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Can my spouse withdraw all the money from our bank account?

If your spouse is named on your bank account, they can make withdrawals from it. However, if the account is in your name only, your spouse legally can't take money from it. If a spouse cleans out a joint account prior to a divorce or separation, a judge or mediator will determine how the money should be disbursed.

How should I split finances with my spouse?

How to split finances is a personal decision. You may want to split finances 50/50 or base the split on how much each partner earns. You can either have separate accounts with a joint account you can use for mutual expenses, or you can just have the joint account, with each person contributing. If your spouse won't combine finances, one of you could pay the other for their portion of mutual expenses, and the other person could pay bills from their account.

Am I responsible for my spouse's financial troubles if we keep our money separate?

If you are not named on your spouse's accounts, you might not be responsible for any financial issues that arise. However, law can be different in one of the nine community property states.

JOYCE CHAN / THE BALANCE

It’s challenging to choose between saving for an emergency and paying off debt. If you’re having a difficult time deciding where to allocate the funds in your budget or from a windfall, you’re not alone. Household debt, separate from housing costs, skyrocketed to the highest level in 16 years in 2020, but at the same time, the household savings rate soared to levels not seen since 1975.12

Is it better to pay off debt or save? Most people need to do both, but we’ll explore factors to consider when deciding which is more important.  

Key Takeaways
Always pay at least your minimum debt payment, and put something toward savings monthly, even if a small amount.
Individual circumstances can help determine priorities if deciding between two options. 
For long-term financial health, simultaneously establish habits around debt payoff and saving money.
What Is the Rule of Thumb About Emergency Savings vs. Debt Payoff?

The general rule of thumb is to do both: Pay off debt while building your emergency savings. “Saving at the expense of accelerating debt repayment ignores the importance of commitment to do both now,” he said. “It should never be an all-or-nothing option,” said Todd Christensen, education manager at Money Fit by DRS, a nonprofit debt management agency. 

If you wait to pay off debt before saving for emergencies or even retirement, but then never manage to pay off the debt, one day you may realize that it's time to retire and that you are completely unprepared—and, perhaps, still in debt. 

You could weight contributions toward your emergency savings—for a while, at least. Christensen suggested saving up a small nest egg—anywhere from $500 up to the amount of one month’s living expenses—if you don’t have anything put aside right now. But continue to pay more than the minimum on your debts. 

For example, suppose you have $100 in discretionary funds per month to put toward emergency savings, debt, or both. In this case, send an extra $5 or $10 to each debt account, and focus the rest on savings. 

Note

""Discretionary"" spending means the amount of money you can set aside each month beyond your living expenses. 

Take discretionary funds out of every paycheck right away, versus seeing what’s left at month’s end. “You never have money left over at the end of the month,” he said, meaning you’ve probably already spent it all. 

Establishing the savings mindset, rather than buying whatever you want every month, will benefit you long-term, he noted. You’ll be more likely to move the former debt payment into savings when you’re caught up on the account.

Samantha Gorelick, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Brunch & Budget, a financial planning firm, recommended a variation on that idea: Pay just the minimums on credit cards until you’ve built a solid savings cushion. 

Start with one month of expenses, she suggested, then try to accumulate a few months of savings. Starting small is fine—perhaps auto-deduct $10 to $20 from your paycheck and sending it to a savings account. 

""While it won't build quickly, you're creating a habit of saving—which makes you a saver,"" Gorelick said. As you get more comfortable with balancing spending and saving, increase the transfer amounts to savings.

If you stay invested for the long-term and keep making regular contributions, your money should at least see some growth and outpace inflation. Historically, until 2018 the stock market has returned around 10% a year on average.3 Your money also compounds in a tax-deferred investment account such as a 401(k) or IRA, so it can grow even more quickly. Missing out on one or two great years could make a big difference in your total savings.

If you are paying off the debt and simultaneously saving, you should end up on stronger footing than you otherwise would be.

How to Decide Whether to Prioritize Saving Money or Paying Off Debt

No one solution is right for everyone. But there are some questions you can ask to help you decide whether to prioritize paying off debt or socking away cash in a high-yield savings account. Ask yourself the following questions: 

What’s My Job Situation?

If you don’t feel secure in your job, prioritize emergency savings. That’s because if you aggressively pay down debt, then lose your job, you still don't have any money even if you have no debt, which leads to more card use, and added debt, Gorelick said. If you have savings, that can help prevent too much credit card use in the event of a layoff or shutdown. 

Christensen agreed, pointing out that having some savings gives you a little more breathing room when job hunting. “The worst thing that can happen when you lose your job and have no emergency savings is feeling like you have to find something, anything,” he said. “You end up in a lower-paying job. Later, when you try to get the type of job you had before, future employers wonder what happened when they look at your resume. It’s a tough situation to be in.” 

On the other hand, saving could be a no-brainer if your employer matches the contributions or a portion of the contributions that you make to your 401(k). With a 401(k) match, you are getting an instant return on your money. Think of it as a bonus or a pay raise. It's easy money. So save at least up to the amount your employer will match, typically anywhere between 3% to 6% of your salary. One exception to the rule is if you plan on leaving your employer prior to being vested in those matching contributions.

How Much Do I Have in Emergency Savings? 

To determine how much you ultimately need in emergency savings, one general rule of thumb is to take your annual income and divide it by $10,000, Christensen said. The resulting figure is how many months of living expenses you’ll need in savings until you find your next job at equal pay. 

If you earn $30,000 per year, for example, save up three months’ worth of living expenses. If you earn $60,000, you need six months’ worth.

If you find that you're drawing on savings every month—instead of contributing to it—Gorelick suggested revisiting your budget. Reduce your monthly contributions, and focus on managing your expenses within your available income.

Do I Need Other Savings?

Christensen noted that “expected” expenses sometimes can be just as difficult as unexpected ones. For example, you’ll probably need to buy a car sometime in the next five to ten years. But if you’re not saving for that car now, you’ll be at the mercy of the lender where interest rates are concerned.  Other “expected” expenses might include appliances or home repairs. Instead of having to draw on home equity to get a loan for those things, you could draw on a dedicated savings account for planned expenses. 


Note

Make your savings hard to access—so you’re not tempted to be a “savings raider,” Christensen suggested. Stash cash in a bank that’s harder to access physically or online, separate from where you do your usual banking, for example. In a true emergency, you want to be able to get to the money within a day or two but not leave it vulnerable to splurging whims. 

What Type of Debt Do I Have?

Some debts have devastatingly high interest rates—such as payday, car title, and pawnshop loans, which can have an annual percentage rate (APR) well above 100%.4 If you have any of these, you’ll want to put as much as possible toward those kinds of debt, Christensen pointed out. Put something into your emergency savings fund, even if it’s $1 or $2 each month. 

Other lower-interest debts, such as mortgage, car, and federal student loans, are still essential to pay regularly, but they may not be as pressing to pay down if you need to build your emergency fund. The higher the interest rate, the more you’ll benefit from getting the balance paid down quickly.

Note

Due to the temporary pause on federal student loan repayment during the pandemic, you could take your monthly loan payment and put that toward emergency savings, Gorelick noted.  

Am I Expecting a Potential Windfall?

If you receive unexpected money from a government source, family member, or employer, spend it wisely. Christensen suggests the following formula as a rule of thumb for how to use that windfall if you’ve already got some savings: 

30% for needs—e.g., replacing broken appliances or repairing your car, to prevent debt down the road
25% for paying down debt
20% for savings
15% for long-term investment 
10% for fun spending

However, if you have no emergency fund, consider this formula: 

35% for emergency savings
30% for needs
25% for paying down debt
10% for fun
Grain of Salt

Rules of thumb are general guidelines that might not work for everyone. You may need to take such rules with a grain of salt in your situation.

For example, if you’re behind on credit card, house, or car debt payments, catch up on those before building an emergency fund, Christensen stressed. Some unpaid loans, such as a car note, could cut off your access to work and other life necessities.  

But even in that situation, “If you can put just a dollar into your emergency fund, you’ve saved something. Being a saver is a lifetime choice, not a just choice until we’re out of the economic downturn. If more people saved, we’d probably never see another payday lender again. They wouldn’t be necessary.”  

Note

If you're unsure, speak with a licensed financial professional or nonprofit credit counseling agency to get the best advice specific to your situation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How can I pay off debt faster?

Accelerating your debt payoff takes focused effort and strategy. The debt snowball and debt avalanche are two commonly used methods. With the snowball, you'll pay off your debt by putting as much as possible toward the smallest debt, then rolling that extra amount to each successively larger debt as you pay off each one. With the avalanche, you'll take a similar approach but start with the highest interest rate and work your way down. In both cases, you'll gain momentum as you close out each debt.

How much money should I save every month?

If you're just getting started saving, one general rule of thumb is to begin by saving 10% of your income each month. Create a budget, and if you find that you can stash away more, then do so. That is a great place to start the habit of saving, and you can increase as you find the room in your budget.

WESTEND61 / GETTY

You might think that marriage is the best choice when it comes to your finances, but getting married isn’t always the answer for every couple. Roughly half of the U.S. adult population is unmarried.1

A domestic partnership has its own financial benefits. The differences between a marriage and a domestic partnership are many, and each has its own advantages. Which is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances.

What's the Difference Between a Domestic Partnership and Marriage?
 DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP	 MARRIAGE
Sharing retirement benefits can be complicated.	Spousal retirement benefits are easier to access.
You may not have access to your partner's health insurance.	You'll have access to spousal health insurance.
There are no special asset transfers.	You have unlimited asset transfers in most states.
You'll avoid the ""marriage tax"" penalty.	You'll get a larger standard tax deduction and gift tax exemption.
You may not have survivor benefits.	You'll have clear spousal death benefits.
There's no financial protection in separation.	Divorce provides financial protection.
Isn't recognized in all states.	Is recognized in all states.

There are some significant differences when it comes to the financial implications for domestic partnerships and marriages.

Sharing Health and Retirement Benefits

Married partners have access to spousal IRAs, and they can roll over a spouse’s IRA into their own upon their partner's death. They also have more options than domestic partners for taking spousal Social Security benefits. You'll also likely qualify for coverage under your spouse's health insurance plan if you're married. This is a pretty standard benefit for married couples.

Sharing retirement benefits can be a bit more complicated for domestic partners, and you may end up paying higher taxes. You might also experience a lack of coverage through your partner’s employer-sponsored health insurance. Your partner's health insurance can also be treated as a taxable benefit if you do get coverage.

Note

Only 34% of companies that offer health benefits to spouses also offer them to opposite-sex domestic partners. That increases to 43% for same-sex domestic partners.2 This is an important factor to consider because buying your own health insurance can be expensive.

Tax Benefits

Tax season may sweeten the marriage deal because couples enjoy several tax benefits when they tie the knot. Your standard deduction is double what it was as an individual.3 You're also eligible for a larger home sale exclusion as a married couple.4

Married couples can transfer an unlimited amount of assets to one another free from gift or estate taxes.5 And your gift tax exemption is doubled to $30,000 instead of $15,000 as of 2021, or $32,000 instead of $16,000 as of 2022, if you plan to give money or property to your family or anyone else in the future.6

But domestic partners avoid the ""marriage tax"" penalty. Married couples who earn roughly the same generally get penalized during tax time because they tend to move up to a higher tax bracket more quickly. It's the opposite of the ""marriage bonus,"" in which one spouse earns significantly less than the other. This delays the tax bracket jump.

Survivor Benefits

You're much better off if you’re married and your spouse passes away without a will. All states recognize a married partner's right to inherit at least a portion of their deceased spouse's assets.7 Domestic partners may not be eligible for death, pension, or survivor benefits if one partner passes away, depending on the state.

Asset Protection

You'll also be better protected financially in the event of a divorce if you're legally married. You'll be entitled to the division of marital assets, as well as potential spousal support. Domestic partners who separate may share these same rights in some states, but the exact laws can vary significantly.

State Recognition

Perhaps the biggest drawback of a domestic partnership is that rights vary so greatly by state. Some—such as California, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington state, the District of Columbia, and Wisconsin—recognize domestic partnerships. Others do not.8

The rules can also vary by city. Lack of domestic partnership rights can often have a big effect on your finances depending on where you live, so this is an important point to consider.

Note

Domestic partnerships were originally formed to provide legal benefits to same-sex couples. They now apply to couples who live together, or couples who are age 62 or older and cohabitate, in many states as well. Domestic partnerships can apply to both same-sex and heterosexual relationships.

Which Is Right for You?

Choosing between domestic partnership and marriage is a personal decision, and it will largely come down to your own values and the laws in the state where you live. Securing all possible financial benefits of a domestic partnership takes a bit more legwork and planning than marriage, so be sure you're discussing everything with a lawyer who knows your state and local laws before you choose that route.

The Bottom Line

Being on the same page with your partner about money is an important aspect of managing your finances regardless of whether you’re in a marriage or a domestic partnership. You may have to change your mindset about money when you get married or decide to become partners.

Life partnership is certainly about more than money, so these decisions should factor in the many different aspects of merging your lives together. Just be sure that money is a part of your planning as you decide whether to get married or become domestic partners.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What's a ""common law"" marriage?

A common law marriage is legally recognized as a marriage even though the spouses never obtained a marriage license or took marriage vows. They've simply lived as married persons. Only eight states recognize these marriages by statute, but they're treated the same as other marriages, and they are comparable to domestic partnerships in all respects.9

How do I annul a domestic partnership that became a marriage?

Dissolving a marriage that was a domestic partnership before you tied the knot is subject to the same rules as ending any other marriage, so some spouses can annul the marriage rather than divorce. The rules for qualifying for an annulment are strict, and it can be difficult to get one. An annulment is effectively a legal statement that the marriage never happened.10

Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Best Way to Set a Budget?

Different methods might be best for different people. For example, many computer programs can help track income and expenses, and they even can be connected to your financial accounts to automatically import data. Others might want to handle the process manually. Regardless, the important thing to do is to set a budget so you can know exactly where you stand with your finances.

What Are the Keys to Managing Personal Finances?

Be as detailed as possible when managing your personal finances. Sticking to a budget, paying down debt, and knowing exactly where every dollar is going can help make it possible to increase your savings. Having the details to find that extra $10 or $20 per week or month that you can save or invest today can add up to thousands of dollars years from now.

What Are the Key Elements of Financial Planning?

Budgeting is a big part of financial planning. To be successful, it is important to account for everything necessary to financial health. In addition to simply knowing your income and expenses, you have to think about where you will be in the future with income and expenses. Insurance, a good investment plan, and more can help you with expected and unexpected expenses that may arise.

The New Deal was an economic policy launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to end the Great Depression. Americans were battered by 25% unemployment, Dust Bowl droughts, and four waves of bank failures.1 They welcomed the government's rescue.

FDR proposed the New Deal to reverse the downward economic spiral. The goals were relief, recovery, and reform for those who were hardest hit. 

Key Takeaways
The New Deal was a series of large-scale relief programs and reforms that FDR implemented to counteract the economic effects of the Great Depression.
The New Deal advocated government spending as a key economic driver boosting consumer demand.
The New Deal played a significant role in countering the Great Depression and revitalizing the U.S. economy.
FDR’s plan revealed just how vital the government’s role is in the management of the nation’s economy.
New Deal Policies

FDR launched the New Deal in three waves from 1933 to 1939. Congress passed dozens of programs to stabilize the U.S. financial system. They provided relief to farmers and jobs to the unemployed. They also built private-public partnerships to boost manufacturing.

FDR's New Deal policies introduced Keynesian economic theory. It said government spending could end the Depression by stimulating consumer demand. The New Deal was a far cry from President Herbert Hoover's ""...hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Government,"" derided by FDR in his 1936 campaign speech.2

Hoover believed a free-market economy would self-correct. Government revenue fell as the Depression wore on, so Hoover cut spending. He signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff to protect U.S. industries. He believed that business prosperity would trickle down to the average person. The Depression worsened instead.3

First New Deal and Its Programs

Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933.4 FDR pushed Congress to pass 15 new agencies and laws in his first 100 days in office. Together, they created ""capitalism with safety nets and subsidies,"" according to historian Lawrence Davidson.5 

Emergency Banking Act - March 9: FDR had proclaimed a four-day nationwide ""banking holiday"" 36 hours after he was inaugurated, to stop bank runs. On the fourth day of the bank closures, a special session of Congress passed a bill in seven and a half hours.6 This Act allowed banks to reopen once examiners found them to be financially secure. By March 15, banks controlling 90% of banking resources had reopened, and deposits far exceeded withdrawals.78 
Government Economy Act - March 20: The act permitted Roosevelt to cut the pay of government and military employees by 15%.9 The $243 million saved went to finance New Deal programs.10
Beer-Wine Revenue Act - March 22: This Act legalized the sale of low-alcohol beer and wine and taxed alcohol sales, raising federal revenue.11 The Beer-Wine Revenue Act was followed by the passage of the 21st Amendment, which effectively ended Prohibition.12
Civilian Conservation Corps - March 31: The program hired three million workers over nine years to conserve public land. They planted forests, built flood barriers, and maintained roads and trails.13
Abandonment of Gold Standard - April 5: FDR stopped a run on the precious metal. He ordered everyone to exchange all gold for dollars.14 
Federal Emergency Relief Act - May 12: This program funded a wide variety of jobs in agriculture, the arts, construction, and education.15
Agricultural Adjustment Act - May 12: This legislation subsidized farmers to reduce crops. It doubled crop prices by 1937. It was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1936 because it taxed processors but gave funds to farmers. That was remedied in 1938.16
Emergency Farm Mortgage Act - May 12: This act provided loans to save farms from foreclosure.17
Tennessee Valley Authority Act - May 18: The program established a federal corporation that built power stations in the Tennessee Valley, the poorest area in the nation.18
Securities Act - May 27: This act required corporations to provide information to investors before issuing stock.19
Abrogation of Gold Payment Clause - June 5: The government no longer had to repay dollars with gold.20
Home Owners' Loan Act - June 13: This act established the Home Owners Loan Corporation that refinanced mortgages to prevent foreclosures.21 It also provided additional capital to mortgage lenders. It had refinanced 1 million homes when lending activities closed in 1936, which was the equivalent of 20% of all urban mortgages.22
Glass-Steagall Banking Act - June 16: This law separated investment banking from retail banking. It prevented retail banks from using depositors' funds for risky investments. It gave the regulation of retail banks to the Federal Reserve, prohibited bank sales of securities, and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The act was repealed in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.23
National Industrial Recovery Act - June 16: This labor and consumer law set up the Public Works Administration to create public works jobs, like the Hoover Dam, Route 66, and New York City's Triborough Bridge. This law also created the National Recovery Administration. It outlawed child labor, established minimum wage rates, and limited the workday to eight hours. It gave trade unions the legal right to bargain with employers.24 It was declared unconstitutional in 1935.25
Emergency Railroad Transportation Act - June 16: This piece of legislation attempted to coordinate the national railway systems.26
Civil Works Administration - November 9: Created thousands of construction jobs to put people to work. Congress allowed this temporary organization to expire on March 31, 1934.27 

Conservative businessmen criticized the New Deal for being too socialistic in 1934. Others, like Louisiana politician Huey Long, said it didn't do enough for the poor. FDR pushed for these additional programs despite their criticisms:

Gold Reserve Act - Jan. 30: FDR prohibited private gold ownership. He increased the price of gold to $35 per ounce, up from $20.67 per ounce where it had been for 100 years.28 That doubled the value of the gold held in U.S. Federal Reserve Banks from $3.56 billion in January 1934 to $7.57 billion by December 1935, making the United States the world's largest owner of gold.29
National Housing Act - June 27: This law established the Federal Housing Administration, which provides federal insurance for mortgages.30
Securities Exchange Act – June 6: The law created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stocks and the stock market.31
Federal Communications Act – June 19: The act consolidated all federal regulations of telephone, telegraph, and radio communications under the Federal Communications Commission.32

Second New Deal Programs

The Supreme Court struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1935.25 Concerned that other programs would also be eliminated, FDR launched the second round of New Deal programs.

These focused on providing more services for the poor, the unemployed, and farmers. FDR spoke about helping the ""...millions who never had a chance—men at starvation wages, women in sweatshops, children at looms.""33

Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act - February 29: This program paid farmers to plant soil-building crops, like beans and grasses, to counteract the Dust Bowl.34

Emergency Relief Appropriation of 1935 - April 8: The program replaced the Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933 and funded the new Works Progress Administration with $4.8 million. It employed 8.5 million people to build bridges, roads, public buildings, public parks, and airports. It paid artists to create 2,566 murals and 17,744 pieces of sculpture to decorate the public works.
Rural Electrification Act - May 20, 1936: The law provided loans to farming cooperatives to generate electricity for their rural areas.35
National Labor Relations Act / Wagner Act - July 5, 1935: This law protected the rights of employees to organize and address working conditions, with or without a union, and created the National Labor Relations Board.36
Emergency Relief Appropriation Act - April 8, 1935: It created the Resettlement Administration that trained farmers and administered farm debt adjustment activities.37 It bought 10 million acres of submarginal farmland and paid farmers to convert it to pasture, preserves, or parks.38 It resettled farmers onto better land and taught them modern conservation and farming techniques.
Social Security Act - August 14, 1935: This law created the Administration and the predecessor of the Social Security Trust Fund to provide income to the elderly, the blind, the disabled, and children in low-income households.39
Third New Deal Programs

FDR rolled out the Third New Deal in 1937. Concerned about budget deficits, he did not fund it as much as the previous two. 

United States Housing Act: Also called the Wagner-Steagall Act, it funded state-run public housing projects.40
Bonneville Power Administration: Congress created a federal agency that delivered and sold power from the Bonneville Dam near Portland, Oregon, which had been built by the PWA.
Farm Tenancy Act: Called the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, it created the Farmers’ Home Corporation to provide loans for tenant farmers to buy their farms.41
Farm Security Administration: This replaced the Resettlement Administration to provide loans and training for farmers.42

The cutback in New Deal spending pushed the economy back into the Depression. FDR urged Congress to enact a $5 billion relief program that consisted of:

Federal National Mortgage Association: This organization resells mortgages on the secondary market to provide more funds for banks to lend.43
New Agricultural Adjustment Act: The law remedied the AAA of 1933.44
Fair Labor Standards Act: This labor law established a U.S. minimum wage, overtime pay, record keeping, and youth employment standards.45

FDR abolished mark-to-market accounting in 1938.46 Some experts believed that it forced many banks out of business. The rule forced banks to write down their real estate as values fell. FDR's new rule allowed them to keep these assets on their books at historical prices.

FDR launched the Federal Security Agency in 1939. It administered Social Security, federal education funding, and food and drug safety. Congress abolished it in 1953.47 

Why the New Deal Was a Success

The New Deal worked. The economy grew 10.8% in 1934 after FDR had launched the first New Deal. The economy increased by 8.9% in 1935 and 12.9% in 1936 when the second New Deal rolled out. The economy contracted 3.3% after FDR cut government spending in 1937.48

The debt only grew by approximately $3 billion a year from 1932, the year before the New Deal, to 1941, when the United States entered the war. Defense spending added $23 billion to the debt in 1942. The amount added tripled to $64 billion in 1943.49 It would have ended the Depression right there and then if that much had been spent in the first year of the New Deal.

Some say that the New Deal didn't work because the Depression lasted for 10 years. They point out that defense spending on World War II was the only thing that ended the Depression, but it would have ended the Depression if FDR had spent the same amount on the New Deal as he did on the war.

New Deal programs softened the extremes of the business cycle. There were 33 major economic downturns, 22 recessions, four depressions, and seven bank runs and panics before the New Deal, from 1797 through 1932, according to Lawrence Davidson of West Chester University. They impacted 60 of the 132 years covered.50 Recessions were more severe because there weren't New Deal federal agencies in place to control corruption, fraud, and exploitation. 

Note

There have been 12 recessions that impacted just 10 out of 60 years since WWII.51 They were milder than those before thanks to the safety nets of the New Deal.

How the New Deal Could Have Prevented World War II

FDR spent 30 times more in 1943 on the war than he did in 1933 on the New Deal.52 There was no resistance to war spending as there was to domestic spending. No one was concerned about the budget deficit when the world was worried about Hitler's military dominance.

However, concerns about the budget deficit sabotaged the New Deal from ending the Depression's global economic catastrophe. It would have ended the Depression if FDR had spent as much on the New Deal in 1933 as he did in the war in 1943, by creating jobs, demand, and economic growth. The Depression's misery helped propel the German people to put the Nazis and Hitler in power.

The United States could have turned its resources toward helping its allies, Great Britain and France, sooner if FDR and the New Deal had ended the Depression in the early 1930s. It would have at least shortened, if not prevented, World War II.

4 Ways the New Deal Affects You

Many of the New Deal's programs are still safeguarding your finances. The four most significant are Social Security, the minimum wage, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the FDIC.

Social Security

The Social Security program provides a guaranteed income for workers who have paid into the system. Most people are familiar with the retirement benefits which can also be extended to the retiree's spouse.

Social Security also pays disability benefits to eligible beneficiaries who become disabled before reaching retirement age. It pays children, surviving spouses, and dependent parents of eligible beneficiaries who die or become disabled. It will even pay benefits to divorced spouses in some cases.59

There's also a Supplemental Security Income program that pays benefits to disabled children and adults with limited income. A Special Benefits program provides for qualified World War II veterans.

Minimum Wage

The minimum wage is the lowest legal wage that companies can pay workers. Its purpose is to prevent employers from exploiting desperate workers. The U.S. federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour as of January 2022, although President Joe Biden signed an executive order on April 27, 2021, requiring all federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of $15 to workers on federal contracts beginning on Jan. 30, 2022.6061

The minimum wage should provide enough income to afford a living wage. That's the amount needed to provide sufficient food, clothing, and shelter. 

Note

Unfortunately, Congress hasn't raised the minimum wage enough to keep pace with inflation.

The minimum wage translates to $15,080 a year at 40 hours per week for 52 weeks. That's more than the federal poverty level for a single person, but it's lower than the poverty level for a couple.62 Someone trying to support a family by earning minimum wage would qualify for federal poverty assistance.

SEC

The SEC regulates stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, making investing safer. The SEC also provides information through Investor.gov that can help you invest. It provides basic education, such as how the markets work, asset allocation, and a review of the different retirement plans. It has a section on ""Selecting Your Broker."" It provides financial planning tools, such as how much money you'll need to retire.

FDIC

The FDIC insures savings, checking, and other deposit accounts up to $250,000 for each account ownership category at each bank. It insures $250,000 per owner for some joint accounts. The FDIC also examined and supervised more than 5,000 banks and savings associations as of 2024.63

The FDIC steps in when a bank fails. It sells the bank to another bank and transfers the depositors to the purchasing bank. The transition is seamless from the customer's point of view.64

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
When was the New Deal passed?

The New Deal wasn't passed on a single date. FDR's New Deal ideas were rolled out in a series of laws passed throughout the 1930s. The first piece of the New Deal, the Emergency Banking Act, was passed on March 9, 1933.6

What was the basic idea of the New Deal?

The central goals of the New Deal were to stabilize the financial system, provide relief to farmers, find jobs for the unemployed, and boost manufacturing. Historians have described it as ""capitalism with safety nets and subsidies.""5

 JOSE LUIS PELAEZ INC / GETTY IMAGES

DEFINITION

The 10% savings rule is a guideline that suggests setting aside 10% of your gross income for retirement or unexpected expenses. If you have no idea how much to save, it gives you a starting point, but it isn't a one-size-fits-all rule.

Key Takeaways
The 10% rule encourages you to save at least 10% of your income before taxes and expenses.
Calculating the 10% savings rule is a simple equation: divide your gross earnings by 10.
The money you save can help build a retirement account, establish an emergency fund, or go toward a down payment on a mortgage.
Adjust your savings accordingly if faced with a low income or severe debt, but don't give up entirely.
Definition and Examples of the 10% Savings Rule

The 10% savings rule is a guideline that suggests setting aside 10% of your gross income for retirement and other important savings. It's more of a personal commitment than an actual rule. Establishing a personal budget that sets aside 10% of your gross income every paycheck is a way of prioritizing savings.

Note

Gross income is your total income from all sources (e.g., paychecks, tips, investments, and bonuses) before any taxes and expenses are taken out.

A retirement account is one of the places you can put this saved money, but it isn't the only option. The funds you set aside under the 10% rule also can be used to create an emergency fund, save for a down payment on a home, and more.

Saving 10% of your gross income is committing to a standard higher than what most individuals in the U.S. save. Since 1983, the personal savings rate in the United States most often has been in the single digits—and that calculation is based only on a percentage of disposable income, not on a percentage of gross income. In other words, average earners in the U.S. typically save less than 10% of their disposable income, which is only what's left over after taxes have been deducted, and necessary bills have been paid.1 This rate went up temporarily in 2020 and 2021, but by October 2021 it was back down to 7.3%.2

How Do You Calculate the 10% Savings Rule?

Figuring out how much to save under the 10% savings rule is about as simple as an equation gets. It's even simpler if you are paid a fixed salary. In that case, your regular paychecks will all be the same, which means you only have to calculate the amount once. If you are paid hourly, your gross pay might vary from paycheck to paycheck.

Either way, take your gross earnings—the amount before taxes or other deductions are withheld—and multiply that number by 0.10. (This is the same as dividing by 10.) For example, if your biweekly paycheck has gross earnings of $1,350, that means you would set aside $135 for savings from each paycheck.

How the 10% Savings Rule Works

Saving often is about self-discipline. It requires the restraint to set money aside for the future rather than spending it now. The sooner you start saving, the greater the impact due to the effect of compound interest. Understanding compound interest can help motivate you to save.

For example, the average median personal income in the U.S. at the end of 2020 was about $36,000 annually.3 That equates to about $3,000 per month. According to the 10% rule, that would mean saving $300 every month.

If you started following the 10% savings rule at age 25 and invested that fraction every month in a retirement account earning 5% interest, by age 65 you would have contributed $144,000. The account also could have earned $313,806.05 in interest, for a total of $457,806.05. But if you waited until age 30 to start saving, your account might have only $340,827.73 by the time you were 65. In other words, the five years that you saved from age 25 to 30 cost only $18,000 in contributions but earned nearly $100,000 in interest. You can see the impact of compound interest by using a compound interest calculator.

If your savings are starting from scratch, it's a good idea to put money in an emergency fund. This is money that should be easily accessible to help handle unexpected expenses that may come up. A basic interest-bearing savings account is a good option.

If saving for an expense that might be several months or even a few years down the road—such as a house or a wedding—CDs might be a good option. They're less accessible than savings accounts, but they typically earn more interest.

Note

If your employer matches 401(k) funds up to a certain percentage of your income, count those matching funds as part of your gross income when calculating how much to save. For example, if you earn $36,000 annually, and your employer matches up to 3%, that's an additional $1,080 you are receiving from your employer each year, making your gross income $37,080 for the purposes of the 10% savings rule.

For retirement savings, you can use a 401(k) account or an IRA account. One of the benefits of 401(k)s is that they are good for anyone who might struggle with self-discipline, since the funds are withheld from your paycheck. The money never hits your bank account, so you cannot spend it. In fact, tax laws dissuade you from touching the money. There is a 10% penalty tax on most retirement account withdrawals before age 59 1/2.4

When the 10% Savings Rule Doesn't Work

The less you earn, the more difficult it can be to save, especially if you are trying to set aside 10% of your gross pay. If you have a lower income or live in a very expensive area, rent, groceries, and utilities can cost so much that the 10% rule is an impossible standard to meet. In that case, save as much as possible, making it a goal to pay down any debts and increase your earnings to the point that 10% is more realistic.

Even if you have a high enough income to save 10%, you might want to reconsider that approach if you have a lot of high-interest debt. If, for example, you have a lot of credit card debt with interest rates around 20%, you will pay more in interest on your debt than you can earn in compound interest on your savings. In that case, you should set aside some money for emergencies (so you don't accumulate more debt) then focus on paying off your high-interest debt before you begin saving.

impact of prioritizing savings over discretionary spending,the balance money,headline_text,No disponible,https://www.thebalancemoney.com/create-a-spending-plan-5094502,"PHOTO: 

FG TRADE / GETTY IMAGES

To create a spending plan, you have to understand where your money comes from and where it’s going, and then put it all together. In essence, the goal is to prioritize your spending by assigning a purpose for almost every dollar of income.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to create a spending plan that really works for you, no matter your financial situation or goals.

Collect Your Expenses

The first step in the process is to see what you are spending your money on.

“Look at the last three to six months of discretionary spending patterns and average it out per month to create a sustainable spending plan,” said certified financial planner (CFP) and author Gary Grewal in an email to The Balance.

To do this, you must first collect bank or credit card statements if you pay with a credit or debit card on most purchases. If you mostly pay with cash or checks, you’ll need to gather receipts and bills. Include periodic bills and expenses that are paid annually, quarterly, or bimonthly, such as tuition, taxes, or insurance, as well as those payments that can change, like grocery receipts.

Categorize Your Expenses

When taking a look at your spending habits and patterns, split up your expenses into categories that match your lifestyle. For example, a simple “home” category could include rent, utilities, and insurance. Or you can lump restaurant expenses and groceries together in a “food” category. If restaurant meals are an occasional treat, though, you might consider placing those expenses in the “entertainment” group.

Note

How someone chooses to categorize their spending will depend entirely on the individual. While one person may view a gym membership as a form of entertainment or extra perk, another may see it as a need. Wants and needs will differ for each person.


Common categories might include:


Home expenses
Credit card or loan payments
Eating out
Groceries
Transportation
Health care
Kids and/or pets
Gifts or donations
Entertainment

Expenses can be classified as fixed or variable expenses. Fixed expenses don’t fluctuate much—for example, rent or monthly auto insurance bills—while a variable expense changes weekly or monthly. For example, monthly grocery runs or clothing purchases are considered variable expenses.

When reviewing your spending, be sure to look closely at the fixed and variable expenses. Variable expenses will likely change more often, and they could have a significant impact on your budget. Within this category of expenses, you will typically be able to identify more areas for cutting back or saving.

Evaluate Your Expenses

Assess expenses with three simple categories: needs, wants, and savings. Tori Dunlap, founder of Her First $100K and an internationally recognized money and career expert, assigns motivational names for these categories, as described in an email to The Balance.

Needs: All the Adulting Expenses You Can’t Escape From

“This money is for the expenses in your life that you need to eat, live, breathe, and all things survival,” she said. According to Dunlap, this includes monthly rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, insurance payments, and loan and credit card payments.

Wants: Fun Spending

These are often entertainment expenses like Netflix subscriptions and dinners out. “Spending doesn’t mean deprivation,” Dunlap said. “There are certain things in life that bring us true joy and happiness. For example, I really enjoy spending money on food, travel, and nesting. By prioritizing contributing money into my other two buckets, I can spend guilt-free on my three value categories.""

Note

Dunlap suggested having enough discretionary money available in the “wants” category to spend money on meaningful things—but not so much that you can spend wherever and whenever you want, ultimately causing you to spend emotionally and compulsively.

Savings: Big-Money Life Goals

“I take my ‘big money’ life goals very seriously,” Dunlap said. Goals might include three- to six-months of living expenses in an emergency fund, paying off debt, or investing for retirement.

She suggested contributing to goals by setting up automatic transfers from checking to goal-oriented high-yield savings accounts or retirement accounts.

Create a Spending Plan

To create a budget for your next month’s take-home income, you have several options.

Some people prioritize spending with the 50/30/20 rule, popularized by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in her book All Your Worth, written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.1 In essence, 50% of your income should go to your needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings.

Note

We’ve created a spreadsheet—The Balance’s Simple 50/30/20 Budget Template—to help you track your spending and income, and also set priorities. We’ve added basic 50/30/20 spending categories, but you can adjust them to suit your needs. If you note your spending is far above the 50/30/20 framework, particularly where needs are concerned, consider big moves such as getting a roommate or asking for a raise.


Not everyone is going to find that the 50/30/20 rule syncs up with their situation. Grewal points out you may want to save more than 20% if you’ve set a goal to buy your first house, for example. Also, a single software engineer living with family could spend much less than 50% on necessities, allowing them to save more—versus an hourly retail worker paying rent on an apartment.


Another method to consider is zero-based budgeting, in which you assign a “job” or expense category to every dollar coming in, based on your priorities. Grewal uses this strategy, with help from the free expense tracker Mint, to set amounts and watch his spending over the month.

With this method, Grewal has automatic payments and deductions set up for retirement funds, credit card, home, car, and travel savings accounts, and three months of fixed expenses in an emergency fund.

Note

A general recommendation from financial experts is to include three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. This amount will differ from person to person, but it is a good range to aim for.2


Other approaches to budgeting include 80/20 budgeting, where you put 20% into savings and spend the other 80%. With envelope-based budgeting, weekly or monthly spending is determined by a system of cash or electronic envelopes—when the cash is gone, it’s gone. This may help you slow down and check your accounts before spending.


The Bottom Line

Whichever method you choose, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to budgeting. What works for you may not be the best method for your mother, for example.

It’s important to keep up with your spending plan and check in on your progress. If one approach is not working for you after you’ve reached one financial goal, for example, test out another. As you set—and reach—new goals, your spending plan will likely change and adapt, too.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What makes up a spending plan?

A spending plan should consist of all of your income and expenses. It should break down all of the money you have coming in, going out, and putting toward savings. In addition to fixed monthly payments, a spending plan should include variable payments and financial goals you hope to meet, such as a family vacation to Europe.

What is the 50/30/20 budgeting rule?

The 50/30/20 rule is a budgeting method that allocates your spending toward needs, wants, and savings for your financial goals. It states that you would allocate 50% of your income to “needs,” 30% to “wants,” and 20% to savings. It was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

If you're in your 20s, you may face significant financial challenges that include paying down your student loans while also saving for retirement. Young people may believe they need to choose between their student loans and their 401(k), particularly since other major purchases are on the horizon, such as buying a car or home.

As a result, focusing on long-term goals such as retirement may seem like a distant priority. However, it's important to save for retirement even when you are paying off student loans, and it's more possible than you might think to accomplish both.

Key Takeaways
If you're in your 20s, you might be facing the challenge of paying down your student loans while also saving for retirement.
Although a typical student loan term can be for ten years, retirement can last 30 years or more, meaning retirement will cost a lot more than your total student debt.
Saving for retirement early is as important as paying off student loans because of the impact of compound interest.
Choosing the repayment plan that best fits your financial situation will help you consistently pay down the balance of your debt while also saving for retirement.
Paying Off Loans vs. Saving for Retirement

For recent graduates and those in their 20s, deciding whether to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) or paying off your student loans can be a daunting decision. Paying off student debt is an important part of achieving financial stability, while saving for retirement is necessary since we all have to stop working at some point in our lives.

Cost of Student Loans

Unfortunately, student loan debt has been on the rise, with most states reporting that 50% of recent graduates from four-year colleges have student loans that range from $18,350 to nearly $40,000 per graduate.1

Also, student loan interest rates can range from 5% to over 7%, and the standard loan term is ten years, depending on the type of loan program. Below is an example of how much a student loan may cost you by the time you're done paying it off.2

Student loan balance: $30,000
Interest rate: 6%
Loan term: 10 years
Monthly payment: $333
Total paid: $39,960
Total interest paid: $9,960

In ten years, you will have paid nearly $10,000 in interest for approximately $40,000 in total.3


Cost of Retirement

Although a typical student loan term can be for ten years, retirement can last 30 years or more, meaning retirement will cost a lot more than your total student debt, depending on when you stop working and how long you live.

In retirement, you'll need to cover both living and medical expenses (which will increase as you age). Typically, you will need to replace at least 80% of your income. If you earn $50,000 per year, you'll need to save enough to have $40,000 per year in retirement. For a 25-year retirement starting at age 60, you'll need at least $1 million ($40,000 * 25).

There might be other sources of income in retirement, such as Social Security, but it will not likely cover your full living expenses. In 2021, the average monthly Social Security payment was $1,555 or $18,660 in total for the year.4

In other words, for 25 years, Social Security might cover a total amount of $466,500 based on 2021 benefits, which is far short of the $1 million needed based on the numbers in our example.

The Power of Compounding

Starting to save for retirement early is as important as paying off student loans because of the impact of compound interest. Compounding means you earn interest on your interest.

For example, if you save $50 per month over 20 years, you will have saved a total of $600 per year, or $12,000 in total. However, if you earned 6% in interest per year and you reinvested the interest earned for the 20 years, you would have $23,000—nearly double the amount you contributed.5

Before you begin making extra student loan payments, use a retirement calculator to see whether your savings are on track. Once you are regularly saving for retirement, you can look into making additional student loan payments.

Maximize Your 401(k) Match

If you're in your 20s and have student debt, one of the best ways to increase your wealth is to enroll in a 401(k) and take advantage of your employer's matching contributions.

Many companies offer some type of matching contribution to 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans. For example, if your company offers a 5% match, it can mean that they'll contribute 5% of your income each year as long as you contribute 5% as well. In other words, the employer match is free money. However, you need to contribute a certain amount or percentage of your salary to qualify for the match.

Even if you have student loan debt, be sure to contribute enough money to your 401(k) to qualify for the employer match. Once you are vested in your retirement plan, the money is yours to keep—even if you leave your job for another company. Also, you may have the option of taking out a loan against your 401(k) in the future if needed.6

Know Your Repayment Options

Prioritizing saving for retirement doesn't mean that you have no options for paying off your student debt. You can still choose a repayment plan that makes saving and paying down your debt easier. Your repayment options primarily depend on whether your loans are federal or private.

Note

Private loans are made without federal funds and come with fewer repayment options. You will need to contact your lender, loan holder, or loan servicer to find out your repayment options. Many private loans can be refinanced to lower your interest rate.

Choosing the repayment plan that's best for your financial situation will help you consistently pay your debt while also saving for retirement. If you have federal loans and don't choose a repayment plan, you will be placed on the standard plan, which is a ten-year term. However, you can switch to a different plan at any time.

For many graduates, the best option is an income-based repayment plan, which calculates your monthly payment based on how much money you are earning. On these plans, any debt that remains after 20 or 25 years is forgiven.

There are many other types of repayment plans, which can be based on your income, discretionary income, or how quickly you want the loan to be repaid. Also, you can consolidate multiple federal loans, creating one monthly payment.7


Important

If you have a direct loan, you can sign up for automatic payments through your loan servicer. When you enroll in this program, you will receive a 0.25% interest rate deduction.8

Financial Steps to Take While Paying Off Student Loans

As you save for retirement and pay off your student loans, you can begin to make progress on other important financial goals.

Pay Off High-Interest Debt

Low-interest student loans or mortgage debt eat up less of your income and are generally tax-deductible. However, debt with interest rates higher than 6%, such as credit card payments, is a bigger drain on your resources and can quickly snowball into a significant financial burden. If you have credit card debt, consider decreasing (but not stopping) your other savings and debt payments until it is paid off.

Create an Emergency Fund

An emergency fund will support you in case of a significant financial setback, such as losing your job or becoming temporarily unable to work due to illness or injury. Your emergency fund should cover three to six months of living expenses. Also, be sure to have some funds allocated to unexpected expenses such as a car or home repairs.

Automatically transfer money directly from your paycheck into a separate savings account. Also, health savings account balances and Roth IRA assets may also be included as part of your emergency fund.

Identify Financial Goals

Student loan payments shouldn’t prevent you from pursuing your life goals. While your budget or personal spending plan may appear challenging, creating a financial plan can help you prioritize how to spend your time and money.

It's important to identify your goals.

Do you want to start a family?
Buy a car?
Buy a house?
Move to a new city?

Writing down your short- and long-term goals, while identifying the actionable steps needed to accomplish these goals, will increase your odds of achieving them.

The Bottom Line

Creating a financial plan that is flexible is the first step you can take to assume control over student loan debt. There are ways to fit your payments into your financial plan in a way that doesn’t neglect your need to save for retirement or pursue other important financial milestones.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Should I save for retirement or pay off my student loans?

Your student loan debt might be significant, but a standard loan term is ten years, while you'll likely need income in retirement for 20-30 years. In other words, paying your student loans and saving for retirement is essential since retirement will cost more in the long term.

How can I save for retirement while paying my student loans?

Saving early for retirement while in your 20s, even if it's only a small amount each month, can add up because of compounding, which is interest earned on your interest. Also, enroll in a 401(k), if possible, and contribute the minimum amount to qualify for the employer match, which is free money.

How do you consolidate student loans?

To consolidate student loans, you can combine several existing loans into one. This means you only have to make one monthly student loan payment instead of several. While there are certain requirements you must meet in order to be eligible; you can start the process by applying for a Direct Consolidation Loan.9

What happens if you don’t pay student loans?

If you don't pay student loans, you will become delinquent, and interest will continue to accumulate. If you default on your student loans, you will face a variety of consequences. These could include collection fees, wage garnishment, federal payments being withheld, damage to your credit score, and more.10

In addition to creating a business plan to use for getting startup financing, there are other good reasons to create a plan. Use a business plan template to look at all the areas of your most standard businesses. The template will help you make sure all areas are covered, so your startup goes more smoothly.

Small business expert Amanda McCormick suggests looking at five key assumptions to make sure you are ready to start and they will help you be more confident of success.

Probably the most important thing you can do with your business plan is to use it to build your startup business. Small business expert Susan Ward suggests creating goals for each section of your business plan and making an action plan to achieve each one of those goals.

Begin with a General Description of Your Business

The first step is to write a general description of your business. This exercise helps you distill your vision and will focus many other portions of your startup plan.

Type of Business

Describe what type of business you are starting, retail, manufacturing, industrial, construction, or some other type of services. Describe what the business will produce or sell.

Legal Organization

Discuss how the business will be organized. Corporations are legal entities that keep the business and personal liability separated. A limited liability company (LLC) is another way to separate business interests from personal. Other forms include the sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporations, and C corporations. The structure you choose will have legal and tax implications so, be sure you research and choose carefully. You may wish to talk to an accountant as you learn about which form your company will take.

Business Location

Describe the facility you will use for your business, including an address and information about the area. Include the square footage and a layout of the business, if this is available. If your business is in your home, describe the space you will use. Discuss whether this location will be purchased or rented and the terms for purchase or rental.

Licenses and Permits

Include information on local ordinances that pertain to your business, as well as licenses and permits you have obtained or need to obtain.

Management and Employees

Describe the owners and management of the business, along with the expected number and types of employees who will be working in the business. This will be a very brief description; you'll be doing a more detailed management plan in a later section. 

Specific Plan for Your Products or Services

 Include: 

A general description of each product
The pricing structure of this product and whether you will have different prices for various markets
Whether you will produce this product or purchase from a wholesaler to resell to your customers

If you are providing services, describe these services in detail, including:

A general description of each type of service and how it will be performed
Pricing for the various services you will be providing
Create Your Marketing Plan 

Create a description of your target market. This description should include:

A description of your ""ideal"" customer in terms of this person or company's characteristics, attitudes, and buying behaviors. This description should be as complete as possible.
A discussion of the information about the ""population"" to whom you will be selling, in terms of numbers and demographics (characteristics), like age, sex, education level, income level, and other important information
A description of the buying behaviors of your target market
Describe the Competition for Your Products or Services

Create a description of the competition for your products or services within your target market, including:

Numbers of competitors
Characteristics of your top three competitors
Unique points of difference between you and your competitors
The ways in which you will emphasize the difference between your products/services and those of your competitors, in terms of delivery, customer service, product differentiation, or other characteristics
Design a Business Marketing Strategy

The next step is creating a strategy for marketing and promoting your company's products or services to this market. Here are some items this marketing and promotion plan should include:

The top three ways in which you will initially inform your target market about the existence of your products and services.
The types of paid advertising you will use to promote your products and services.
The ways in which you will use publicity to promote your products and services.
The personal selling methods you will use to promote your products and services.
The types of materials (brochures, flyers, web site)you will use to promote your new products and services.

Along with your marketing and promotion strategies, you will need to create a budget for all of these activities, for the first three years of your business.

Necessary Financial Statements for Business Startup

The most important step in the process of creating your business plan is the creation of your financial documents. This section will also take the most time and effort. Here is the information you need to include in your financial plan:

Startup Costs Worksheet

This financial statement should include all of the equipment, supplies, and other items you will need to purchase for the startup, as well as fees and licenses, deposits, initial expenditures for advisers, and costs for creating your business structure.

Beginning Balance Sheet

You will need to prepare a startup balance sheet, showing assets, liabilities, and owner's equity as of the date of the startup.

Month-by-Month Budget for 1st Year

Include a detailed statement (sometimes called a ""cash flow statement"")showing month-by-month sales and collections, along with all monthly business expenses.

Pro Forma Income Projections

You will need to prepare a pro forma (projected) income statement (P&L) for the first three years of operations, showing income and expenses, along with pre-tax income, tax liability, and after-tax income for each of these years.

Break-Even Analysis

If you are selling products, you should create a break-even analysis, showing the point at which you expect to break even on product sales.

Sources and Uses of Funds

Many lenders request that you include this statement, itemizing all of your financial needs for the business, along with your personal investment in the business, and the financing expected from your lender or investor.

Personal Financial Information

If you take your business plan to a lender or investor, you will also be asked to provide personal financial information. Preparing this information for inclusion in your business plan will help you gain the trust of these individuals. Here is what you should bring with you to all owners for the last three years.

Tax returns for the past three years
A recent credit report, showing credit score
A personal financial statement -- you can use the SBA personal financial statement (PDF) template as a guide
A resume or curriculum vitae

Finally, you will need to create a management plan (who's running this company), an operating plan (how is it being run), and an executive summary.

Create a Management Plan

Create a description of the management of your business, including:

Owners and Directors

Describe the backgrounds and qualifications of the individuals who will own the company and make top-level decisions. This may include your Board of Directors if you are incorporating.

Managers and Employees

Describe the key management positions you will require; if you have any of these key positions filled, discuss the qualifications of the people who will fill them. Include an organization chart, showing the top positions and the types of employees who will be working in your organization.

Business Advisors

Include information about the key advisers for your business, including consultants, your CPA or financial advisor, attorney, insurance agent, and banker. If you have not selected some of these individuals, discuss the qualifications you will be looking for to fill these positions.

Create an Operating Plan

 Create a plan for operations for your business, including:

Day-to-day Operations

Describe how your business will operate on a daily basis. What production process will be used? What will you do to market and sell products and services? What hours will you be open?

Accounting and Financial Operations

Describe how your accounting, billing and collections, and other financial operations will be conducted.

Computer and Technology

Include a discussion of the computer and technological systems in your business. Will you operate a website? If so, who will maintain it? What computer hardware and the software will be used? What will your phone system look like? What office equipment will you need?

Create an Executive Summary 

The last step in preparing your business plan is to create an Executive Summary. This document summarizes the business plan information and is placed at the beginning of the document.

Your Executive Summary is important! It may be the only part of your business plan that a lender sees, so make it excellent.

The Executive Summary should be interesting to your reader and provide basic information about the business. In particular, the Executive Summary is intended to summarize your financial needs for startup or purchase. Here are the points you should emphasize in your Executive Summary:

Company information, including the company name, when it was founded or purchased when it will open for business, and the location and legal form of organization.
A one-sentence description of the products and services of the business.
Several sentences that discuss the purpose of the business, its mission/vision, and other information to interest your reader in the business.
A general description of your target market, your competitive position, and your unique differences from your competition.
A discussion of your specific financing needs, including your own investment in the business, startup/purchase funding, and needs for operating capital during startup.
A discussion of your own investment in the business and your expectations of when the business will break even or make a profit.

THE BALANCE / JULIE BANG

Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) follow seven financial planning steps to create recommendations for their clients. These steps are considered to be the practice standards for CFPs. They should be followed to comply with the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards' Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct if the planner and client agree the standards are part of the scope of engagement between them.

These steps could also be learned and applied by individuals for their own benefit if they wanted to act as their own nonprofessional financial planner.

What Are the 7 Steps of Financial Planning?

The seven steps of financial planning start with getting to know the client's current financial situation and goals and end with continually measuring performance toward those goals and updating them as necessary.

Understanding the client's personal and financial circumstances.
Identifying and selecting goals.
Analyzing the client's current course of action and potential alternative course(s) of action.
Developing the financial planning recommendation(s).
Presenting the financial planning recommendation(s).
Implementing the financial planning recommendation(s).
Monitoring progress and updating.1
Note

The CFPB defines financial planning as ""a collaborative process that helps maximize a Client’s potential for meeting life goals through Financial Advice that integrates relevant elements of the Client’s personal and financial circumstances.""1﻿

Step 1: Understanding the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances

The CFP begins their financial planning process by asking their clients questions designed to help them get a clear picture of who the client is and what they want. Some of the questions are qualitative and lead to a better understanding of the client's health, family relationships, values, earnings potential, risk tolerance, goals, needs, priorities, and current financial plan.

Some of the questions are quantitative and lead to a better understanding of the client's income, expenses, cash flow, savings, assets, liabilities, liquidity, taxes, employee and government benefits, insurance coverage, and estate plans.1

The advisor may ask open-ended questions to uncover necessary information to start the plan. This information may include a range of topics, from financial goals to feelings about market risk to dreams about retiring in the Caribbean.

The advisor will also analyze the client's financial information to ensure they have a clear understanding of where their client stands.

Note

For example, if you are working on retirement planning, some of the key information needed is your annual income, savings rate, years until proposed retirement, age when you are eligible to receive Social Security or a pension, how much you've saved to date, how much you will save in the future, and the expected rate of return on your investments.

Step 2: Identifying and Selecting Goals

The advisor will use their financial expertise to help their client select goals. They'll ask clarifying questions to help identify those goals. For example, what is your time horizon? Do you want to accomplish this goal in five years, 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years? What is your risk tolerance? Are you willing to accept a high relative market risk to achieve your investment goals, or will a conservative portfolio be a better option for you?

Together, the financial planner and client will prioritize which goals are most important.

Step 3: Analyzing the Client's Current Course of Action

Next, the advisor will analyze the client's current course of action to see if it's moving them toward their financial goals. If it's not, the advisor will identify alternative courses of action and let the client know the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

Step 4: Developing the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)

The financial planner selects one or more recommendations that they believe will help meet the client's goals. They evaluate each recommendation, considering:

What assumptions were made to develop the recommendation
How the recommendation meets the client's goals
How it integrates with other aspects of the client's financial plans
How high a priority the recommendation is
Whether the recommendation is independent or needs to be implemented with other recommendations1
Step 5: Presenting the Financial Planning Recommendations

In this step, the financial planner presents the recommendations and the thought process behind the recommendations. This helps the client make an informed decision about whether the recommendations are a good fit.

Step 6: Implementing the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)

Implementing the plan means putting the plan to work. But as simple as this sounds, many people find that implementation is the most difficult step in financial planning. Although you have the plan developed, it takes discipline and desire to put it into action. You may begin to wonder what may happen if you fail. This is where inaction can grow into procrastination.

If the financial planner has implementation responsibilities, you'll also clarify what those are so you know exactly what steps your CFP is taking on your behalf.

Note

Successful investors will tell you that just getting started is the most important aspect of success. You don't need to start at a high level of savings or an advanced level of investment strategy. You could learn how to invest with just one fund or you could start saving a few dollars per week to build up to your first investment.

Step 7: Monitoring Progress and Updating

It's called ""financial planning"" for a reason: Plans evolve and change just like life. Once the plan is created, it's essentially a piece of history. This is why the plan needs to be monitored and tweaked from time to time. Think of what can change in your life, such as marriage, the birth of children, career changes, and more.

These life events may require new perspectives or changes to your financial plans. Now think about events or changes beyond your control, such as tax laws, interest rates, inflation, stock market fluctuations, and economic recessions.

Your CFP will work with you to ensure your plan is meeting your goals, and if it's not, they'll recommend changes.

The Bottom Line

Now that you know the seven steps of financial planning, you can apply them to any area of personal finance, including insurance planning, tax planning, cash flow (budgeting), estate planning, investing, and retirement. While you can do it yourself, professionals can provide invaluable advice and a neutral perspective on your finances.

Whether you do it yourself or hire an advisor, remember to keep referring back to the steps as significant life or financial changes occur. You may also want to do what professional financial planners do and sit down and reevaluate your plan periodically, such as once per year.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is financial planning?

Financial planning is taking the time to determine your short- and long-term financial goals and plan how to get there. Financial planning can be done with a professional advisor, like a CFP, but it could also be done on your own. You can use many tools to help you with goals like paying down debt, evaluating your spending, and planning for retirement. If your situation is complicated, if you have a significant amount of assets, or if you want a neutral party to evaluate your situation, seeking out a financial planner to assist you can be helpful.

How much does a financial advisor cost?

Financial advisors use different fee structures. Some charge a flat fee for planning and advice. Others charge a percentage of the assets they're managing on behalf of a client. Some advisors might use a combination of the two methods, where they charge a flat fee for the plan and an ongoing fee for managing funds.

 PETER DAZELEY / GETTY IMAGES

Many people assume a budget is a cut-and-dry, one-size-fits-all regimen. In reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. There are dozens of different budgeting techniques that suit a variety of tastes. Here are some of the most popular options.

01
of 05
The Traditional Budget

 PETER DAZELEY / GETTY IMAGES

The traditional budget is the one that comes to most peoples' minds first. You list your income, list your expenses, and find the difference. (Hopefully, you're earning more than you're spending.)

After that, you set goals for how much you want to spend in each category, such as groceries, gas, and entertainment.

This can be a great budgeting technique for people who are detail-oriented and who have more time. It's not so great for people who are ""big-picture"" thinkers, creative types, and busy people.

02
of 05
The 50/30/20 Budget

The 50/30/20 budget is a simplified plan in which you break down your expenses into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

50 percent of your take-home pay should go towards needs, 30 percent should be devoted to wants, and 20 percent should get put into savings.

Dividing needs from wants can be tricky. ""Needs"" include your only vital necessities. You might think that groceries are a need, but there are items that are ""wants."" For example, the fruits and vegetables you buy at the store are a need, while the Oreo cookies you buy at the store are a ""want.""

Lumping them together under the broad umbrella of ""groceries"" causes you to co-mingle ""needs"" and ""wants.""

03
of 05
The 80/20 Budget

The 80/20 Budget is even more simple than the 50/30/20. Under this strategy, you simply skim your savings off the top, and then freely spend the rest.

Twenty percent is the minimum you should save. You should put at least 10-15 percent away for retirement. You can use the rest for emergencies, buying your next car in cash, home repairs, and other long-term savings goals.

You can also modify this into the 70/30 budget, 60/40 budget, or even the 50/50 budget, depending on how aggressively you choose to save.

The beauty of this budget is that once your savings are cared for, you don't need to worry about where the rest of your money is going. This is also known as the Pay Yourself First budgeting method.

04
of 05
The Sub-Savings Accounts Method

Here's a spin on the 80/20 budget: you can decide how much money you need to save by funneling your money into sub-savings accounts based on your goals.

You open multiple savings accounts and give each one a nickname based on specific goals, like ""Paris vacation"" and ""future car repairs."" Then you set a goal ($2,000 for the Paris trip by next January; $800 for future car repairs by this March) and divide the dollars by the timeline to see how much you should save each month.

Now you can auto-draft money each month from your checking account into your multiple savings accounts. Once you're done, freely spend the rest.

05
of 05
Budgeting Tools & Apps

This isn't a budgeting ""method,"" but it's worth mentioning. Many people, particularly those who want to create a more traditional line-item budget, use software, tools, and apps to automate their financial tracking.

Programs like Personal Capital, You Need a Budget, and Mint can help you track your spending within a variety of categories. You won't have to maintain a paper-and-pencil ledger.

THE BALANCE

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to allocate your budget according to three categories: needs, wants, and financial goals. It’s not a hard-and-fast rule but rather a rough guideline to help you build a financially sound budget. 

To better understand how to apply the rule, we’ll look at its background, how it works, and its limitations, and we'll go through an example. In other words, we’ll show you how and why to set up a budget using the 50/30/20 rule of thumb yourself.

Key Takeaways
The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a guideline for allocating your budget accordingly: 50% to “needs,” 30% to “wants,” and 20% to your financial goals. 
The rule was popularized in a book by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi.
Your percentages may need to be adjusted based on your personal circumstances.
It’s only a rule for how to plan your budget; it doesn’t actually track your budget for you.
What Is the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb?

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a set of easy guidelines for how to plan your budget. Using them, you allocate your after-tax income to the following categories.

50% to Needs

Needs are what you can’t live without, or at least not very easily. They include things like:

Rent
Groceries
Utilities, such as electricity, water, and sewer service
30% to Wants 

Wants are what you desire but don’t actually need to survive. They might include:

Hobbies
Vacations
Dining out
Digital and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu
20% to Financial Goals

This category covers two main areas:

All savings, such as retirement contributions, saving for a house, and setting money aside in a 529 college savings plan (note that contributions to a 401(k) come from your pre-tax income)
Debt payments

Because this is just a guideline for planning your budget, you’ll need to supplement it with something to monitor spending, such as a budget tracker like YNAB (You Need a Budget), Mint, or Quicken. You can then set the 50/30/20 percentages as targets within whichever budget tracker you prefer.

Where Does the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb Come From?

The 50/30/20 rule was popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren (a Harvard law professor when she coined the term) and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, in the book ""All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan."" It was designed as a rough rule of thumb for working-class families to plan their spending to prepare for the future and unforeseen circumstances.

How to Use the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb for Budgeting

Most people save too little and unknowingly spend too much. The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to become aware of your financial habits and limit overspending and under-saving. By spending less on the things that don’t matter that much to you, you can save more for the things that do.

Here’s how it works:

Calculate your monthly income: Add up how much you receive in your bank account each month. If you have a workplace retirement plan, find out how much is withheld, and add that amount back in with your take-home pay. If you pay estimated taxes, reduce your monthly income amount accordingly.
Calculate a spending threshold for each category: Multiply your take-home pay by 0.50 (for needs), 0.30 (for wants), and 0.20 (for financial goals) to see how much you should ideally spend in each category. 
Plan your budget around these numbers: Think of these three categories as “buckets” that you can fill with monthly expenses. List and tally your monthly expenses under the category that each falls into and see whether you’re spending less than the monthly targets you established in the prior step.
Follow your budget: Track your expenses each month, and make changes where needed, to stick to your spending thresholds going forward.
An Example of the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb

Here’s an example using the steps above:

Calculate your monthly income: Let’s say you and your spouse have a total of $4,787 deposited into your bank account each month from your jobs. You both check your pay stubs and see that a total of $532 was taken out for 401(k) contributions. This means that together, your monthly income is $5,319 ($4,787 + $532).
Calculate a spending threshold for each category: Based on the 50/30/20 rule, the amount you should allocate to “needs” is $2,659 ($5,319 x 0.50). The amount you should allocate to “wants” is $1,596 ($5,319 x 0.30). The amount you should allocate to financial goals is $1,064 ($5,319 x 0.20). Since you’ve already contributed $532 to your 401(k)s, use the remaining $532 to pay down debt or save for other financial goals. 
Plan your budget around these numbers: Go through your budget to either plan out your spending or see how well it is already aligned with these targets. 
Total Monthly Income	$5,319
Needs: $5,319 x 0.50	$2,659
Wants: $5,319 x 0.30	$1,596
Goals: $5,319 x 0.20	$1,064
Why the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb Generally Works

Figuring out your finances is confusing, and it’s often hard to know where to start. That’s one reason the 50/30/20 rule of thumb works so well: It’s an easy way to get a handle on something that can otherwise be intimidating.

Even if you don’t take it any further by tracking how well you stick to these targets, it’s still a good way to take your financial pulse.

Grain of Salt

Like any rule of thumb, it’s a good idea to take the 50/30/20 rule of thumb with a grain of salt.

Potential for Gray Areas

It’s sometimes hard to sort out your spending according to three categories. Everyone needs to eat, for example, but some groceries fall into the wants category (like sugary sodas and unhealthy snacks). 

Can Be Difficult for Low-Income People

If you’re earning just enough to make ends meet, you may struggle to save 20% of your income regardless of how you live, especially if you’re supporting a family. 

Savings Might Not Be Enough

On the flip side, if you have big goals, like retiring early or buying a house in a high-income area, 20% might not be enough. 

For example, the average home price of a house in San Francisco was about $1.3 million in June 2024.1 You would need to save, on average, $260,000 to afford a 20% down payment there.

You Still Need to Track Your Budget

The 50/30/20 budget rule is only one piece of the budgeting puzzle. It’s good to shoot for these percentages, but unless you track your spending, you’ll never know whether you’re actually hitting them. 

The 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb vs. Other Budgeting Methods

The 50/30/20 rule of thumb isn’t the only game in town. Here are a few other budgeting techniques that might work better for you:

The 80/20 Rule: With this method, you immediately set aside 20% of your income for savings. The other 80% is yours to spend on whatever you want, with no tracking involved. 
The 70/20/10 Rule: This rule is similar to the 50/30/20 rule of thumb, but you instead parse out your budget as follows: 70% to living expenses, 20% to debt payments, and 10% to savings.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How does tithing figure into the 50/30/20 rule?

As with any rule of thumb, you'll need to adjust it to fit your specific circumstance. When it comes to tithing or any other religious expense, individuals can decide for themselves whether that's something they ""want"" or ""need.""

Where does credit card debt go in the 50/30/20 rule?

Paying down debt is considered a financial goal. That means you should allocate 20% of your budget toward some combination of paying down debt and saving for the future.

How much of your paycheck should you spend with the 50/30/20 rule?

The 50/30/20 rule doesn't specify how much of each paycheck you should spend. The percentage of your paycheck that you spend or save largely depends on the 20% financial goal category. If your main financial goal is to reduce debt, you'll be spending more of your paycheck on that. If your main financial goal is to save up an emergency fund, then you'll be saving more of your paycheck.

Budgeting is a crucial step toward a healthy financial life. It allows you to look at your monthly income and create a clear action plan of what you will do with your money before you spend it. Whether you’re planning to pay down debt, save for retirement, or tame your spending on groceries every month, budgeting can help you achieve your financial goals faster.

Key Takeaways
Budgeting gives you control over where your money is going.
Choosing the right budgeting strategy can help you achieve financial goals.
Creating wiggle room makes it easier to stick to your budget.
Prioritizing savings can provide better financial stability.
Know Your Income

All budgeting starts with knowing your monthly after-tax income, also known as your “take-home” pay. Getting a complete picture of where your money comes from will help you create the foundation for setting your spending and savings goals. Begin by identifying how much money you can expect to bring into your household each month.

Income may come from multiple sources, including your regular paycheck, a side hustle, child support, or government benefits. You can calculate total monthly income by listing each source of income, then writing down the minimum amount each one will bring in after taxes.

Note

If you are self-employed, you may have inconsistent income. Consider using your earnings from the lowest income-earning month you’ve had in the last two years as the baseline amount when setting up your monthly budget.

Choose Your Budgeting Strategy

Budgeting can feel like an overwhelming task for some people. But keep in mind that the best budgeting method is the one that works for you. “There are many great ways to budget, but each plays to different skill sets and financial goals. So don't feel like you have to conform to a strict method,” Kari Lorz, a Certified Financial Education Instructor (CFEI) and founder of Money for the Mamas, told The Balance in an email interview.

50/30/20 Budgeting

If you’re looking for a simple budgeting method,  the 50/30/20 budgeting strategy may be worth a try. It works by splitting your monthly income into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

TAKE-HOME PAY	BUDGET CATEGORY	TYPE OF EXPENSE
50%	Needs	Mortgage/rent, food, utilities, transportation
30% 	Wants 	Eating out, shopping, vacations, entertainment
20% 	Savings 	Emergency fund, debt payoff, retirement
Zero-Based Budgeting

If you want to know where every dollar you earn is going, you may like zero-based budgeting. It lets you control your spending by determining where every dollar goes before you spend it.

Note

Zero-based budgeting is not about spending your money until you have nothing left. It means allocating your money toward your expenses and goals so that if you have money left after expenses, you’re intentional about dedicating it to a goal like debt payment or savings.

Categorize your expenses and figure out exactly how much you’re going to spend in each category and on what. You’ll probably want to first allocate funds to food, housing, utilities, transportation, debt repayment, and other essentials.

Next, you might allocate a certain amount to building your emergency fund or contributing to a savings account for a new home. What’s left may go to entertainment, travel, or other fun expenses. At the end of each month, you’ll get a chance to redo your budget and change anything you need to.

Cash Envelope

The cash envelope strategy works well for people who prefer a more concrete, hands-on budgeting system to help get spending under control.

This technique involves labeling envelopes based on your budget categories—for example, groceries, utilities, and transportation. You then separate actual cash into each envelope. Once the money is gone, that’s all you can spend on that item for the month. This method can create an acute awareness of where your money is going, making it much harder to overspend.

Note

There are envelope budgeting apps you can use for electronic funds and credit or debit card payments if you don’t want to use cash to pay for everything.

Give Yourself a Margin

Always trying to keep track of every dime you spend can feel tedious. So setting aside a certain amount of money to be your margin of error every month is a way of creating breathing room in your budget. “A margin is the secret sauce for maintaining a monthly budget and achieving your financial goals,” Damian Dunn, Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and Vice President of Advice with Your Money Line, told The Balance in an email interview.

However, make sure you’re still financially responsible. You can add a little flexibility into your budget, but keep track of your spending so you don’t go over the margin you’ve given yourself.

How To Create a Margin

The key to creating a margin is to identify how much of your income you don’t need to spend each month. That’s your buffer, or margin. “A margin allows us to absorb the unexpected things that pop up every month without needing to resort to credit or raiding the emergency fund. Ideally, I love to see budgets with 5% to 10% of margin,” said Dunn.

Dunn knows your margin is affected by life circumstances, “But once you've got a margin, fight like crazy to keep it.” In other words, don’t let lifestyle creep eat away at that buffer.

Pay Yourself First

When trying to budget a host of expenses, finding money to save sometimes seems impossible. Try budgeting for your savings before anything else and paying your bills with what’s left after you’ve planned for your savings. This is often called “paying yourself first.”

To do this, set up automated savings contributions so you can save money before you start spending your paycheck.

“Automated savings contributions help create an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach. I would argue that it’s difficult to ever get ahead when you don’t make your savings a priority in your life,” Lorrie Delk Walker, a financial advisor with Allen & Company in Lakeland, Florida, told The Balance in an email.

Use a Budgeting App

When you need extra help staying on top of your spending, a budgeting app can help you track your money right from the palm of your hand. The right app for you is one whose features and costs best suit your financial needs. A few popular choices include:

Mint by Intuit: This is a free tool that links all your accounts, categorizes your transactions automatically, helps you set up budgets, and tracks your spending.
You Need a Budget (YNAB): This app uses the zero-based budgeting system. You can also link your accounts, manage spending, pay down debt, and save. It is a paid service that offers a free trial.
Pocket Guard: Helps you optimize spending, link your accounts, and save automatically. The basic version is free.
Track Your Progress

At its core, budgeting is simply a spending plan. Keep track of your spending to see what’s working, where you’re struggling, and where your money is going. In the beginning, it may help to track your spending on a daily or weekly basis, and assess your budgeting method every month or so. Once you’ve settled on a method you think works, you can make assessments after longer intervals.

“Tracking progress and making adjustments is critical,” Jeff Grampp, CFF and director at Gateway Investor Relations, told The Balance in an email interview. “The costs of things change over time, as do consumption habits. So every year or so, take time to reassess where you're at and gauge the accuracy of your budget.""


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is budgeting?

Budgeting is the process of making a consistent and intentional plan for your money. Make sure your budget works for you. If you feel limited by your budget, it may be time to change it. Make sure your budget includes some fun goals or splurges. That way, you’re more likely to stick with it.

Why is budgeting important?

Budgeting is important because it makes sure you have enough money to cover your expenses and that you’re intentional about what you do with the rest of your money. It helps you pay close attention to your spending, savings, and general financial health. When you create a plan and set goals, it’s easier for you to control your finances and make informed decisions about your spending. It’s also easier for you to identify financial risks and opportunities.

What are some common budgeting mistakes?

Sticking to a budget can be tricky, and  being restrictive doesn’t help. If your  budget doesn’t have any margin for error or you’re too hard on yourself, you might get so frustrated that you give up on your budget. You should also make sure to track your spending, set money aside for an emergency fund, and review your budget regularly to make sure it’s up-to-date.

DEFINITION

The debt snowball strategy helps you pay off your debts by tackling the smallest balances first and building momentum toward the larger ones.

Key Takeaways
The debt snowball strategy helps you pay off debt by focusing on your smallest balance before moving in order to the larger ones.
You'll always pay minimums on all debts, but put any extra money toward your smallest debt first.
It won't save you as much in interest as the debt avalanche method, but it can help you stay motivated.
If you need extra help managing your debt, visit with a nonprofit credit counseling agency (or explore debt settlement as a last resort).
What Is the Debt Snowball Strategy?

The debt snowball method works by building a snowball-like momentum as you gradually pay off debts. To do this, pay off the smallest debt first and move on to the next-smallest debt. Then, continue through the rest of your loans with the same approach. 

During the process, continue making the required minimum payments on all of your loans, putting any extra money each month toward the smallest loan balance. Dave Ramsey originally popularized this method, and since then, many people have used it to successfully pay off their debts.

Note

If you feel overwhelmed by debt, a debt snowball strategy can help you regain a sense of control while paying off credit cards and loans. Other strategies, like the debt avalanche, can minimize interest costs, but the debt snowball method works well when motivation is critical.

How the Debt Snowball Method Works

Setting up the debt snowball strategy is simple and involves just a few steps.

Get organized: Make a list of all of your debts. Order them from the smallest balance at the top of the list to the largest at the bottom. As you build your list, ignore the interest rates, monthly payment amounts, and other loan features. Focus only on the balance.
Pay the minimums: If you don’t pay the minimum required on all of your loans and credit cards, you may have to pay fees and penalties, and it may damage your credit score.
Pay extra on your smallest balance: Each month, put any extra money available toward the credit card or loan at the top of your list. Your goal is to aggressively pay off that smallest balance first.
Build on your success: After paying off your smallest balance, cross it off the list and move on to the next-smallest balance. Take everything you were paying toward the smallest loan and apply that to the next one, on top of the minimum payment you were already making. As you finish paying each debt, your total payment toward the next one will grow larger and larger.1
Note

Mobile apps are a great tool for using and tracking the snowball method.

The Debt Snowball in Action

Assume you have several loans outstanding. Your budget shows that you have an additional $100 available each month for extra loan payments. You can put that $100 to work and pay off debt by using the debt snowball strategy. 

 Start by listing each loan or credit card debt from the smallest loan balance to the largest.

Debt Snowball Example
Type	Balance	Rate	Minimum Payment
Personal loan	$2,000	7%	$39.60
Private student loan	$13,000	5%	$183.74
Credit card	$16,000	17%	$480.00
Auto loan	$21,559	4.75%	$404.38

With the debt snowball, your extra $100 per month goes toward your personal loan first. As a result, you pay $139.60 (the required $39.60 plus the additional $100) to that lender each month. Continue paying the minimum on your other three loans.

 After you pay off each loan, that loan’s payment becomes available for additional debt payments. 

After paying off your personal loan, you now have $139.60 extra for the next loan (because you don’t have minimum payments to make to your personal loan lender anymore). 
You can send extra money each month to your student loan servicer. The payment will be the required $183.74 plus $139.60, for a total of $323.34.
After paying off your student loan, you have an additional $323.34 available each month for paying off your credit card.
The process continues to build momentum until you finally wipe out all of your debts.
Note

See the example above and create your own repayment plan in our debt snowball calculator.

Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche

The debt snowball differs from another popular debt repayment strategy—the debt avalanche. The avalanche method, also known as debt stacking, prioritizes debts with the highest interest rate (instead of the smallest loan balance). It lowers your total interest costs and will make you debt-free faster, but it may not give you those quick wins to stay motivated.

In the example above, you would prioritize the credit card instead of the personal loan because of the credit card’s rate. But paying down that $16,000 balance could take a long time, and you risk becoming discouraged. A debt snowball provides a sense of accomplishment early in the process, and you may appreciate that positive reinforcement.1

Should I Use the Debt Snowball Method?

The debt snowball is an excellent debt elimination strategy. If you enjoy positive reinforcement in small victories and don't have a lot of high-interest debt, it could be a good option for you. 

The snowball method isn’t right for everyone, though. In some cases, it might not make sense to accelerate your payments on certain debts. For example, if you’re pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness for federal student loans, the Department of Education might allow you to stop paying after 120 qualifying payments.2 If successful, the remainder of your debt will be forgiven, so there isn't much benefit to paying extra. Instead of paying extra on those loans, it may be best to pay as little as possible under income-driven repayment and put extra money toward other high-interest-rate debts. 

Whichever strategy you choose, it's important to find the one that you feel you'll be able to stick to until all your debts are paid. The avalanche, for example, won't save you money if you end up stopping halfway.

Note

When you have loans with high interest rates, it might make sense to focus on those first. Lower-rate loans don’t put a significant drain on your finances, and you can pay those off later.

What to Do If You Need Help

While the debt snowball helps you eliminate debt when you have extra income, sometimes you need additional help. Several options are available.

Credit Counseling

Credit counseling agencies are nonprofit organizations that provide education and assistance with debt. You can discuss your situation with a professional, and if necessary, the agency can help you establish a debt management plan (DMP). When using a DMP, you may be able to lower your monthly payments and interest rates, making it easier to manage your loans.

Debt Settlement

Debt settlement is another option, and is considered a more extreme solution. Debt relief companies help individuals manage their outstanding debts by negotiation or consolidation of balances. The service will work out a payment plan, or even help individuals file for bankruptcy in exchange for a fee. Creditors need to agree to the deal, though, and lenders might not be willing to accept your offer. 

Debt settlement can also hurt your credit score, so it’s best to exhaust all of the alternatives before going down this road.3

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How does the debt snowball work?

The debt snowball method pays off your smallest debts first. Then, it rolls the money you were paying toward your paid-off debt to the next balance you want to pay off. As you pay off a balances, you have more money to pay off the next balance.

Is it better to snowball or avalanche?

The best repayment strategy really has to do with what you're most comfortable with. If you don't need the motivation of paying off balances, then the avalanche method might work best for you. However, if you need inspiration from paying off balances to keep you focused, then the snowball method may be the right choice.

DEFINITION
A debt repayment plan is a strategic series of steps you take to pay off your outstanding debts.

If you’ve ever gone to college or bought a car or home, it’s likely you’ve taken on some type of debt. While debt isn’t always a bad thing, too much debt can leave you struggling to pay your bills every month. And if you take on high-interest credit card debt, you could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest.

That’s why it’s a good idea to come up with a debt repayment plan. A debt repayment plan will help you repay your debt over time and gain more control over your financial future. 

Definition and Example of a Debt Repayment Plan

A debt repayment plan is a strategic series of steps you take to pay off your outstanding debts. It’s a plan you put in place to eliminate your debt and get your finances back on track. 

A good debt repayment plan will help you manage your payments and ensure you stay motivated. It’ll also help you cut down on interest charges and avoid falling behind. For example, you may come up with a goal to pay off your debt in three years, and from there, you decide to figure out how you can get there by paying off $400 each month. Your plan might include specific strategies for lowering your interest costs or increasing your income so you can meet your goal.

How a Debt Repayment Plan Works 

A debt repayment plan is a structure you put into place to help you pay off your outstanding debts. You’ll take specific steps to lower your monthly bills and pay down your debt. 

The plan that’s right for you will depend on your financial situation and preferences. Regardless of what steps you choose to take, a good debt repayment plan should include the following elements.

Account For All Outstanding Debt

The first step you’ll take is to account for all your outstanding debt. Create a spreadsheet and list your debts in order of size or interest rate. Knowing how much you owe, what your monthly payments are, and how much you’re paying in interest will help you come up with a debt repayment strategy.

Lower Your Other Monthly Expenses

Next, you’ll want to look for ways to lower your other monthly expenses so you can free up money (if possible) to put toward your debt. You can use a budgeting app to see how much you’re spending each month, and look for expenses you can cut. 

Lower Your Debt Costs

You may also want to consider ways to lower your interest rate, so that the total cost of your debt falls. For example, you could try negotiating with your lender for a lower rate, or getting a balance transfer credit card or personal loan to consolidate your high-interest credit card debt at a lower rate.1 That, in turn, would lower your monthly payments. 

Choose a Repayment Strategy

Finally, you’ll choose a repayment strategy that works for you. Here are two you can consider for paying down loans and credit card debt:

Debt Snowball: With the debt snowball method, you’ll start by paying off your smallest debt first and making minimum payments on everything else. Once you pay off your smallest debt, you’ll apply that money toward the next smallest debt, essentially creating a “snowball” of payments as you pay off each balance. Research has shown that borrowers are more likely to pay off all their debt if they focus on paying down the smallest balances first. 2
Debt Avalanche: With the debt avalanche method, you’ll list out your debts based on the interest rates. Then you’ll focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first while making minimum payments on everything else. This plan doesn’t focus on the size of your debt—instead, the goal is to save the most money in interest payments. 
Note

The advantage of the debt snowball method is that since you start seeing progress right away, it can be very motivating to continue. But it means you may end up paying more money in interest as you won’t be focused on the costlier debts right away.3

Debt Repayment vs. Debt Management

When you’re facing debt, you may also consider a debt management plan. A debt management plan (DMP) is a kind of debt repayment plan—but it’s done with outside help. 

Debt Repayment	Debt Management
A plan to repay your debts over time	A type of debt repayment plan created and overseen by a third-party company 
You may come up with and implement the plan on your own and continue to pay your creditors directly.	A credit counseling company consolidates your debts and negotiates with your creditors to lower your interest rates and fees; you make one monthly payment to that agency, which pays your creditors.
You may choose to keep your credit cards open.	You are required to close credit cards included in the DMP so you can’t use them to incur more debt.
No extra cost	May require modest fees

While a DMP is more restrictive than a repayment plan you create on your own, you may find it helpful to have the extra structure and support. A credit counselor reviews your financial situation and works with you to create a tailored plan. They may also negotiate with your creditors to lower your interest rates. Counseling usually includes information about budgeting, making payments, and staying out of debt in the future. If you go this route, look for a credit counseling agency that’s part of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling or the Financial Counseling Association of America.

You may need to pay for a DMP, however. There may be an initial setup fee of up to $30-$50 and a monthly fee (usually $20-$75).4 If you go the DIY route, you of course won’t have those expenses.


Note

Don’t confuse nonprofit credit counseling companies with debt settlement companies. For-profit settlement companies often require you to stop making payments to your creditors altogether for many months in hopes of pressuring them to settle your debt for less than what you owe. But there’s no guarantee of success, and the process can ruin your credit score.5 

Key Takeaways

Debt will keep you from reaching your financial goals, like saving for retirement or buying a home. It can be a source of stress and grief, causing you to constantly worry about your finances and regret the limits debt has placed on your life.

Fortunately, debt isn’t a life sentence. You can (and should) make getting out of debt a priority. Follow these seven steps to take control of your finances and pay off your debt for good.

1. Understand the Type of Debt You Have

Getting out of debt—and staying out—requires that you change the habits or circumstances that led you to debt in the first place.

Understanding the type of debt you have and how it happened can help you create a plan for paying it off and make it less likely that you will fall back into debt in the future.

Note

If you have debt that you don’t know how to manage, consider talking to a credit counselor. Credit counseling agencies are usually nonprofit organizations, such as the Financial Counseling Association of America or the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. They are staffed with trained agents who can help you with:

Understanding your debt
Tracking your spending
Creating a budget
Developing a debt repayment plan1
Debt Due to Loans

Taking out loans happens naturally at certain stages of life. You may take out a loan to open a small business, buy a house with a mortgage, purchase a new car with an auto loan, or take on student loans to fund your education.

These debts are not inherently bad and often come with manageable interest rates. However, they can create a strain on your finances when you are unable to make the required payments. They can eat up too much of your income, preventing you from covering living expenses or saving money.

When that happens, you may find yourself taking on other debt, either in the form of credit card debt or personal loans, to make up the difference.

Debt Due to Circumstance

Sometimes debt accumulates due to circumstances outside your control. Many people have medical debt stemming from unexpected illnesses or injuries. You may have debt due to divorce. Or you may have become unemployed and had to take on credit card debt or take out personal loans or payday loans.

These debts can be crushing because they come with high interest rates. Often, you are forced to take them on when your financial circumstances were already strained. And as you attempt to pay them off, they can eat into your income and require you to take on more debt, creating a debt spiral that feels impossible to escape.

In many instances, such as when medical bills go to a collection agency, you may not even be aware that the debt exists until a collection agent calls you at home to report that you have unpaid bills.2

Debt Due to Spending

Thoughtless or reckless spending can create its own debt, usually in the form of high-interest credit card debt. Living beyond your means, such as taking out a mortgage your income cannot support or buying a car you cannot afford with an auto loan, can also create debt due to spending.

Once you accumulate debt due to overspending, you end up paying far more in interest and penalties than the actual value of what you purchased. This can tie up your income, requiring you to take on even more debt. Living beyond your means can even cause you to default on payments or end up declaring bankruptcy.

2. Take Control of Your Spending

Whether or not careless spending habits contributed to your situation, you will find it easier to start to pay off your debt if you keep close control of your spending and finances.

Take time to compare your monthly income with your expenses. Divide your spending into mandatory expenses, or needs, and discretionary expenses, or wants.

Mandatory expenses include things like:

Rent or mortgage payments
Utilities
Food
Transportation to/from work
Health insurance
Child support
Prescriptions
Childcare

Discretionary expenses include things like:

Cable TV
Gym memberships
Eating out
Clothing
Entertainment
Home decor
Personal grooming

To start paying off your debt, your monthly expenses will need to be significantly lower than your monthly income. You may be able to achieve this just by reducing your discretionary spending.

Note

Pay your bills on time to save money. Late payments usually trigger fees or service charges that can make it harder to reduce your spending. Where possible, automate your payments to come from your checking account.

If that’s not enough, however, you may need to take further control of your spending by lowering your mandatory expenses as well. You can use tactics like:

Downsizing if you rent your home or negotiating your rent
Renting out a room or floor if you own your home
Choosing a cheaper cellphone plan
Splitting internet access with a neighbor
Choosing a less expensive health insurance plan
Looking for ways to cook cheaply, such as eliminating meat from your diet
Using public transit instead of your car

You can also look for ways to increase your income, even temporarily, such as:

Taking on a second job
Doing occasional gig work
Putting all your credit card rewards toward cash payments instead of points
Insisting on payment for money you are owed, such as child support or alimony
Selling household items, jewelry, or clothing
Note

Local pawnshops make it easy to sell your items for cash. However, you will likely make more money if you sell directly to other consumers through Craigslist, eBay, Etsy, or your local consignment shop.

Once you have reduced your spending as much as possible, create a budget. This will prevent you from accidentally overspending. You want to make sure your expenses stay below your income, otherwise you will end up owing more money in the form of credit card interest or overdraft fees.

Reducing your spending as much as possible and taking control of your finances with a budget will allow you to put all almost your extra money toward paying off your debt.3

3. Figure Out How Much Debt You Have

If you have more that one type of debt, it can be easy to lose track of how much you owe and how much you are paying in interest every month. But you cannot begin to pay off your debt until you know what those values are.

Make a list of all your debts, how much you currently owe, and the interest rate being charged. Use recent billing statements, canceled checks or bank statements, and your credit report to get a complete list of everyone you owe and the amount you owe. Be sure to include the minimum payment required for each account. This is the smallest amount that you can afford to pay on your debt every month.

Note

Including the interest rate associated with each account will show you not only how much you currently owe but also which debts are the most expensive. High-interest debts, like credit card debt or payday loans, can cost you many times the value of the loan itself because of the amount of interest that is added on every month.

4. Decide How Much You Can Afford To Pay

If you pay only the minimum every month, it can take years or even decades to finally pay off your debt. To eliminate your debt much faster, you’ll have to send more than the minimum payment to at least one of your accounts each month.

Use your monthly budget to decide how much you can spend on debt repayment each month. Subtract your expenses from your income, including any irregular or periodic expenses that may pop up during the month. What's left over after you’ve covered all your necessary expenses is the amount you can spend on your debt. Use this amount in your debt plan.

Note

If your income varies per month, base your amounts for your budget and debt repayment on the lowest income you expect to have. If you have extra some months, you can use that money for debt repayment. The more money you can put toward your debt, the faster you can have it paid off.

Remember, you need to make the minimum payment on each debt every month, so however much you have in your budget for debt repayment, you will first need to subtract every minimum repayment from that value. Whatever is leftover, you can put toward truly paying off your debt.

For Example
Your monthly income is $4,000, and your monthly expenses are $3,500.
$4000 – $3500 = $500 for total debt repayment.
You have three debts with minimum payments of $50, $75, and $100 per month.
$500 – $50 – $75 – $100 = $275 for accelerated debt repayment.
5. Put Together a Plan

Decide in what order you are going to pay off your debt. You can decide to prioritize based on the interest rate, balance, or some other criteria that you choose. You can also use additional debt management strategies to reduce your monthly payments or consolidate your debt.

Whatever debt repayment strategy you choose, stick to your plan and send payments on time every month to avoid additional fees and interest charges. Eliminating your debt completely can take months or years depending on the amount of debt you have and the payments you make. Consistency with your payments is a necessary part of getting out of debt.

Note

Debts that have gone into collection can do the most damage to your credit score, and repeated calls from collection agencies can damage your overall emotional well-being and stability. If you have debts that have gone to collection agencies, these are the ones you should repay first.

The Snowball Method

Using the snowball method, you pay off your debts from the smallest to the largest.

Note

The “snowball method” is a term coined by Dave Ramsey. The name refers to the strategy of starting with something small and building it into something bigger, the way a snowball is made.

Make the minimum payment on every debt, then put any extra funds you have toward the debt with the smallest balance. This will be the one you can pay off most quickly, allowing you to see immediate progress on your debt repayment.

Once this debt is paid off, move onto the next smallest debt on your list, while continuing to make the minimum payment on everything else. You will have more money to put toward paying off this debt because you now have fewer minimum payments to make every month.

Continue until you have paid off all your debts.

Debt Stacking

This strategy focuses on prioritizing debt by interest rates.

The higher the interest rate, the more a debt will cost you over time. Eliminating the debt with the highest interest rate will allow you to save the most money in the long run.

Note

Debt stacking is sometimes called the avalanche method, in contrast to the snowball method.

Make the minimum payment on every debt, then put any extra funds you have toward the debt with the highest interest rate. Once this debt is paid off, move on to the next highest interest rate while continuing to make the minimum payment on everything else. As with the snowball method, you will be able to put more money toward paying off each subsequent debt because you have one fewer minimum payment to make every month.

Student Loan Adjustments

If you have student loans, you may be able to have the amount you owe adjusted based on your income or financial situation, particularly if you have loans from the federal government. This can help you lower your monthly payments while you focus on paying off other debts or improving your financial situation.

Once you have eliminated your other debts, you can start to make higher payments on your student loans.

Debt Consolidation

If you are having trouble managing too many debts, you can consolidate them into a single debt, even if you want to consolidate with bad credit. This is a personal loan that covers the cost of your current debts, leaving you with only a single payment every month.

Consolidation does not eliminate your debt, but it does simplify it. However, it can be accompanied by high fees and variable interest rates that could end up being more expensive than what you were previously paying. Before consolidating your debt, it is best to speak to a credit counselor to decide whether this is the best course for your financial situation.

If you decide to use a debt consolidation loan, be careful not to take out additional loans or open new credit cards before it is eliminated. Otherwise, you will end up with additional debt that you cannot repay.4

6. Build an Emergency Fund

As you work toward paying off your debt, you should also start to put money away in and an emergency fund. Building an emergency fund gives you more flexibility to handle surprise expenses, which makes it less likely that you will go into debt again in the future.

Even a few hundred dollars can help if you need to have car repairs done or pay a doctor’s bill. This will reduce the likelihood that you have to take out a payday loan or additional credit card debt when unexpected expenses arise.

Note

Use a high-interest savings account or a money market account so your emergency funds earn interest but remain accessible at all times.

7. Don’t Create More Debt

Creating debt while you’re trying to pay off debt will hurt your progress and create more interest that you cannot pay off. While you are attempting to pay off your current debt, avoid using your credit cards, opening new credit accounts, or taking out new loans.

You may decide to close your credit card accounts entirely if you don’t think you’ll be able to resist using them. However, you can also keep a credit card on hand for emergencies but not use it for everyday spending.

Note

You can freeze your credit cards to prevent yourself from using them if you don’t want to close the accounts completely. Place your credit cards in a bowl or plastic bag full of water, then put them in the freezer. You’ll have to put in a lot of effort to get them out of the ice, which will give you time to rethink using credit before you’re out of debt.

You can estimate the time it will take you to become debt-free by using a debt repayment calculator. Some let you enter a specific monthly payment or a debt-free deadline to customize your repayment plan.

Note that your debt repayment time may fluctuate depending on the amount you're paying toward your debt and whether you create additional debt. Revisit the debt repayment calculator once or twice a year to see how you’re progressing toward your debt-free timeline.

8. Bounce Back From Setbacks

It may not be smooth sailing on your path to debt freedom.

A financial emergency could require you to cut back on your increased payment for a few months. You may find yourself needing to use credit cards or take out a personal loan to handle an unexpected situation.

When that happens, recalculate your budget and pick back up with your payments as quickly as possible. Overcome discouragement and keep your debt repayment on track.

Creating debt milestones may help you stay focused and encouraged while you pay off your debt. By celebrating the small successes, like paying off your first loan or eliminating 10% of your total debt, you can make it easier to stay motivated toward eliminating your debt completely.

If you are a recent college graduate you likely have some major life transitions coming your way in the not so distant future. Despite all of the financial uncertainties that may be looming over the horizon it is important to have a financial plan to guide you during the transition.

Financial plans are essential whether you are getting started in your career, moving to a brand new city, or simply trying to upgrade your home or apartment. However, if you are like many other recent graduates you may have trouble thinking about retirement since you may be beginning your life after school. Using the concept of beginning with the end in mind, here are some tips to help you achieve true financial freedom (a.k.a. “retirement” in some circles):

1. Establish a Written Financial Plan That Is Flexible

Just remember that your financial plan will not probably look anything like your parents’ financial plan. You can begin the creation of your written plan by making a list of “SMART” financial goals. But don’t stop there! Be sure to create a list of other important life goals and put them in writing. Some people find that creating a “dream board” is a helpful way to visualize your goals and stay focused.

When you are creating your list of life goals you can also include a separate list of possible life events that may be just over the horizon. These possibilities could be those major unknowns in life that you want to eventually be prepared for and work into your financial planning. A few examples include buying a first home, getting married, having a child, going back to school, or taking a brief sabbatical to travel the world.

Taking the time to create a written list of your life goals will help you stay focused on what matters the most to you during this important season of life. A written financial plan also gives seemingly mundane tasks such as budgeting, saving, and investing more purpose and meaning.

So, how can you make sure that your financial plan is more impactful than “traditional” plans of the past? You can start by keeping your plan short and simple and it doesn’t need to be any longer than a one-page financial plan.

2. Create a Realistic and Flexible Budget or Personal Spending Plan

If you really want to achieve the authentic financial freedom you have to dare to be different than the average person. The average American does not follow a spending plan. Budgeting doesn’t have to be an overly complex or frustrating person. In fact, you simply need to have a plan that provides some general spending guidelines before the month begins.

There are many different budgeting systems that work. Online tracking tools like Mint and YouNeedABudget are just some of the many tools available to help. Here is an easy spending plan using a simple spreadsheet approach. No matter how you choose to create your budget it is essential that you use this spending plan as a guide regardless of your income or net worth.

3. Make Savings Automatic

When you examine your spending plan you should strive to put savings as a top priority. Always strive to save as much as you possibly can, but focus on saving in the right type of accounts. An emergency fund is one of the first places to direct your savings efforts. Most financial planners recommend trying to maintain at least 3 to 6 months of basic living expenses in a separate account from your everyday checking account. This is an ideal long-term goal but it can be a very difficult goal to reach if you are just starting out in a new career after graduation.

During your 20’s and 30’s, there is a tendency to let present bias make it difficult to find the balance between current spending and planning for the future. That is why you will have more success in reaching your goals when you choose to automate savings through payroll deduction or automatic transfers of at least 10% of your income.

4. Realize When It Is Okay to Prioritize Paying off Debt Ahead of Savings

There are a few exceptions to the ultimate goal of keeping 3 to 6 months of living expenses in an emergency savings fund. One of those exceptions is if you have high-interest credit cards or other personal loans. In that case, it is necessary to establish a “starter emergency fund” which may be 1-2k and then make extra payments on that debt with that are above and beyond the required minimum payments.

One of the best financial habits to create early in your career is to always pay the full balance due on credit cards each month.

5. Avoid Future Temptations to Remove Money From Your Retirement Accounts

The days of working for one employer throughout an entire career are long gone. So it’s no surprise that your first job after graduation will not be your last. Many people make the mistake of cashing out retirement plans when switching jobs instead of benefitting from continued tax deferral through 401(k) or IRA rollovers. Not only are 401(k) withdrawals subject to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty they also rob us of future retirement savings.1 From my experience as a financial planner, I’ve found early retirement plan distributions to be one of the leading causes of IRS tax problems and a decision most people will end up regretting later in life.

6. Recognize That Your Credit Score Is Important but Does Not Guarantee Financial Freedom 

Yes, it is important to consistently monitor and review your credit…but don’t obsess over it. That being said, you shouldn’t wait until you are ready to buy a car or house to check your credit score. If you haven’t started building your credit while in college, don't worry. You may have to shart small—like with a fixed-limit credit card—but it is something you can do.

You can visit free sites such as the Annual Credit Report.com website to obtain credit reports from Transunion, Equifax, and Experian. Other no-cost resources such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. These reports will allow you to view your credit score. The sites and also provide free credit monitoring services that can help alert you when anything unusual happens to your credit. 

A best practice financial action step is to always check your credit report at least once per year and take steps to protect your credit and your financial identity. Just remember that a good credit score will help you qualify for competitive interest rates on future mortgages and can even help you consolidate existing debt to a lower interest rate. True financial freedom will occur when you have eliminated debt and no longer need to rely on a credit score.

7. Focus on Financial Priorities Rather Than Letting Student Loan Frustration Guide Your Decisions

According to recent estimates, the average student loan debt for federal loans is $36,406.2 Student loans definitely appear extremely overwhelming when you first graduate from school. However, there are a variety of payment options available and it’s essential to recognize that student loans aren’t the only form of debt to be laser-focused on.

Other important financial priorities such as paying down high-interest consumer debt (e.g. credit cards, personal loans) are often viewed as a higher priority. In addition, it is important to establish your financial freedom fund (a.k.a. the “emergency fund”) prior to making extra payments on your student loans.

8. Define What Financial Independence Means to You

I’ve had the opportunity to speak with recent graduates in my role as a financial educator. While many of these financial workshops are focused on saving and investing for retirement I don’t use that word “retirement” too much. After a 16 year career as a financial planner, I personally find the word retirement to be a very difficult concept to define. The reality is that every one of us should have our own unique definition of retirement. But it is extremely difficult for recent graduates to consider the idea of life after work since most grads are just launching new careers.

Instead of focusing on a long-term goal and trying to predict what your future self will be like, place your emphasis on defining what financial freedom looks like to you in the here and now.

What do you look forward to doing the most? How do you enjoy spending your time today? What are some future life goals you want to achieve?

Unfortunately, not all of us are innately programmed to plan for the future and it is easy to let the YOLO principle guide financial decisions. Don’t let present bias derail your good intentions or prevent you from doing any planning for the future.

9. Use the Tax Code to Legally Avoid Taxes and Increase Your Savings

Not everyone has the time, energy, or desire to master the IRS tax code. But if you devote enough time to understanding the basics you will be on the fast track to financial freedom. Start by contributing as much as possible to your 401(k) or retirement plan at work. At a minimum, you should always take full advantage of any matching contributions offered by your employer. Then focus on choosing the right asset location for your retirement savings. The pre-tax vs. Roth 401(k) decision is primarily based on whether you need the tax break now (pre-tax) or in the future (Roth).

If you don’t have a retirement plan available to you through an employer you have the ability to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you are in a high deductible health care plan that is HSA eligible, contribute as much as you can in order to lower your taxes today. The good news with HSAs is that you will be able to take out this money tax-free anytime for health care expenses and they can help supplement your retirement savings.3

From a financial planning standpoint, the years following graduation are an important time to begin laying the foundation to achieve real financial freedom as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, not all schools teach these important financial lessons and experience is often the best way to learn. If you or someone you care about is a recent graduate be sure to celebrate your accomplishments and set the stage as early as possible for an even bigger task—true financial independence.
