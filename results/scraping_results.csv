It’s always a good time to give your student debt repayment plan a check-up. Regardless of your situation, there are some basic steps you can take to avoid stress and save money in the long run.

Understand what makes student loans unique
Take control of your loans
Save yourself time and money
Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)
Get an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans
Exercise your rights as a servicemember
Avoid scams and wasting money
Take action when you run into problems
Understand what makes student loans unique

Student loan interest begins to accrue after the loans are issued, and borrowers can expect to pay more than they originally borrowed. But student loans also have some unique traits, and understanding these can help you make more informed financial decisions.

How does interest work with student loans
Interest accrues daily, in most cases starting the day your loans are disbursed. If you have a subsidized federal loan, the government will pay your interest while your loans are in a deferred status – for example, while you are in still enrolled at least half time in school or in your six-month, post-school grace period. The government also will pay your interest when your loans are placed in deferment due to a return to at least half-time enrollment in college, economic hardship, unemployment, cancer treatment, or military deployment. Whether you have a subsidized loan or unsubsidized federal loan, you will be responsible for the interest that accrues during a forbearance.
Depending on the type of loan, unpaid interest may be capitalized after a period of deferment or forbearance, meaning that it will be added to your loan principal balance when you resume making payments. In other words you will pay interest on interest.
For Direct Loans and other federally-owned loans, interest is capitalized after a deferment on an unsubsidized loan or if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest that accrues during a forbearance, while you are in school or in the post-school grace period is no longer capitalized into the principal balance of your Federal Direct Loans.
If you have certain, older federal loans that are not owned by the federal government, interest may capitalize after the post-school grace period or a deferment on an unsubsidized loan, after certain types of forbearance, or, if you are repaying your loans under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and no longer qualify to make payments based on income or leave the IBR plan.
Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in an example. Suppose you borrow $10,000 for your last year of school, at an annual interest rate of 3.65%, with repayment starting exactly 1 year after you get your loan funds.

With a daily interest rate of 0.01% (3.65% ÷ 365), you will accrue $1 in interest each day, for a total of $365 by the day repayment starts.
If you don’t pay off the $365 before repayment starts, then it will capitalize. Your principal will increase to $10,365, and your daily interest will go up to $1.0365.
If you stay on Standard Repayment Plan, with ten years of equal monthly payments, you will pay about $103 a month, with about $17 going to interest.
But suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR) and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account, causing your loan balance to grow. This is negative amortization.
Negative amortization happens when the total amount you owe increases as you repay your loan if you’re not paying off your interest each month. Your interest charges will be added to the amount you owe, causing your loan to grow over time. This can occur if you are in a deferment for an unsubsidized loan or if you have an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and your payments are not large enough to cover the monthly accruing interest.

Interest under the SAVE repayment plan

Learn more about additional SAVE plan benefits that will go into effect in 2024 .

Interest rate example:

Let’s put these concepts together in a couple examples.

The first example illustrates how much interest can accrue before repayment begins. Suppose you borrow $10,000 under an Unsubsidized Direct Loan for your last year of school at an annual interest rate of 3.65%. Repayment will start exactly one year after your loan is fully disbursed. In this example, you receive half the loan amount on September 1st and second half on January 1st.

The second example shows how interest accrues during repayment. In this case, you have $10,000 in Subsidized Direct Loans when you leave school. You were not charged any interest while in school or the grace period. The interest rate on these loans during your repayment period is 3.65%.

If you enroll in a standard repayment plan, with equal monthly payments over ten years, you will pay about $100 a month for 120 months. During your first year of repayment, about $350 of those payments will go to interest.
However, suppose you apply for income-driven repayment (IDR), other than the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, and qualify for a $5 payment. Your payment will not cover your monthly interest charges, and the remainder will stack up in your account. This will cause your loan balance to grow rather than shrink, even though you’re making regular payments. This is negative amortization.
How do payments and credit reporting work with student loans?
The best way to protect your credit is to always make your payments on time and in full.
When you make a payments, it is applied to fees, then interest, and then principal. Extra payments can save you time and interest. No late fees are charged for loans owned by the Department of Education (ED).
Each loan you receive appears on your credit report as a separate account. Your payments will be recorded this way too, even if you’re making a single payment to one servicer.
When your loan is report delinquent depends on whether it’s a private or federal student loan.
Private student loans may be reported delinquent as early as 30 days without a payment.
Federal loans owned commercially in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program are considered delinquent at day 60.
Federal loans (Direct and FFEL) owned by ED are reported delinquent at day 90 of no payment.
What happens if I miss a student loan payment?
The first day after you miss a payment due date, your loan becomes delinquent.

UPDATE! U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced a one-time temporary program that offers benefits to borrowers with federally-owned student loans who fall behind on their payments during the first 12 months following the end of the pandemic payment pause. From October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, missed monthly payments on your federally owned student loans will not be reported to credit reporting companies, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies. The Department of Education has directed its servicers to apply administrative forbearances to accounts that become delinquent during the on-ramp.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about this temporary “on ramp” period .

After the on-ramp period ends, accounts that become at least 90 days delinquent will be reported to the nationwide credit reporting agencies. Borrowers who continue to miss payments risk defaulting on their federal loans.

When does default occur?
If you continue to miss payments, your loan will eventually enter default. For most federal loans, this occurs after 270 days, or approximately 9 months, although loans are not reported to be in default until they reach the 360th day of delinquency and are sent to collections. Banks and other private lenders typically charge-off private education loans when they become 120 days past due, but charge-off rules vary by lender.
A default note will go on your credit report, which can have a negative impact on your credit score.
Once your loan is in default, the lender can file a lawsuit against you to collect on the debt. This is because student loans are unsecured debt, which means there is no collateral to repossess, such as a car or house.
Defaulting on a federal student loan can have additional consequences. You could lose your eligibility for all federal student aid and face garnishment of your federal tax returns, wages, and Social Security payments.
However, typically there are other options for getting out of default. If you are struggling to afford your student loan payments, reach out to your servicer immediately to ask about your options. Reliable lenders will want to work with you to help you get out of default.
Federal loans offer rehabilitation and consolidation.
Private lenders may be willing to negotiate a deal with you.

Visit ED’s website to learn more about the Fresh Start Initiative .

How can I get rid of my student loans?

Outside of repaying your loans in full, ED offers multiple options for loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge  for your federal student loans.

There are options available for paying off your private student loans. Contact your private loan lender to determine what option is best for you.

Borrowers who expect to be incarcerated for at least 10 years should inform their loan servicer.

Learn more about ways to pay off your student loan debt.

Take control of your loans

Now that you understand the ins and outs of your loans, let’s go over some strategies for getting them paid off as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Know what you owe. Make a list of your student loans. Include whether they’re private or federal, monthly payment and due date, the current and principal balances, the interest rates, and servicer. If you’re not sure, start by checking your free credit report . For federal loans, it will also help to know what type of loan it is (such as PLUS, subsidized, or unsubsidized) and the name of your repayment plan. You can look up your federal loans at studentaid.gov  .

See if your loans fit into your budget and pay schedule. Make a budget and explore strategies for reducing debt to help you see how your student loans fit into your finances. Request a different due date if that would make it easier for you to make your payments on time and in full.

Make sure your federal repayment plan is the best one for you. You can use Education Department’s Loan Simulator  to compare plans by monthly payment, total interest, and more.

Save yourself time and money

Set up direct debit (aka autopay) for 0.25% off your interest rate. With direct debt, your payment is taken automatically from your bank account each month.  All federal direct loans and many private lenders offer this discount.

Extra payments  can get you out of debt faster and save you money on interest—if you can afford them. To get the full benefit, tell your servicer to apply extra payments to your highest interest rate loan(s) first. 

Stay in touch with your servicer. Make sure your servicer has your current mailing address, phone number, and email address. Open their mail and answer their calls so you find out about problems quickly, before consequences snowball.

Keep good records. Save all the mail from your servicer. Take notes when you talk on the phone with them: jot down the date, the name of the person you’re talking to, what you asked, and how they answered.

Claim your student loan interest on your tax return. Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may be able to claim up to $2,500 of the student loan interest you paid in a given year.

If your payment is too high, seek income-driven repayment rather than a pause on payments. Pauses, known as deferment and forbearance, are not long-term solutions. Interest continues to accrue during forbearance for all federal loans and during deferment for unsubsidized loans, which could make them more expensive than enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan, especially the new SAVE plan .

Stay on track with income-driven repayment (IDR)

NEW: Visit ED’s website to learn more about the new one-time income-driven repayment (IDR) Account Adjustment and see if you qualify .

An income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can reduce your monthly payment to as low as $0. Use ED’s Loan Simulator to choose the right plan for you. 

Learn about SAVE, the newest IDR plan, and how to enroll. The SAVE plan is the most affordable student loan repayment plan in history. It may provide you with the lowest monthly payments and reduced times to getting loan forgiveness if you borrowed a small loan. Also, under the SAVE plan, if your monthly payment doesn’t cover the accrued interest, that interest will not be charged to you. Instead, it will be forgiven, meaning your loan balance will not grow. Visit ED’s website to learn more about SAVE and how to enroll .

Automate your IDR recertification. Borrowers enrolled in IDR plans must annually recertify their income and household size. As part of the FUTURE Act, you can provide consent to ED to automatically recertify your IDR payment based on information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By consenting, you allow ED to receive your tax return information and your monthly payment will be automatically adjusted without you having to recertify each subsequent year. If your income has changed from your most-recent tax return, you can always submit additional documentation to have your monthly payment reviewed.

Set a reminder to renew your paperwork. If you don’t consent to the automatic recertification, you will need to confirm your income annually in order to keep your payment based on your income. Failure to recertify will likely result in a significant increase in your monthly payment amount. It can also result in interest capitalization.

Renew your IDR income recertification early if your income goes down or your household grows. Your monthly payment will be recalculated. These plans allow repayment flexibility based on your income (or lack thereof) you may be eligible for a lower monthly payment, possibly as low as $0, through an income-driven repayment  (IDR) plan.

Beware of capitalization. For federal student loans, interest will be capitalized – or added to your principal – under two circumstances: when you exit a period of deferment on an unsubsidized loan or when you are repaying a loan under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and you no longer need financial assistance as determined by the regulations. In other instances, interest may accrue but not be added to the principal. Keep in mind that a monthly payment will be applied against outstanding interest before it will be applied to your loan principal. In the new SAVE plan, any interest that remains after a monthly payment is applied will be forgiven by ED and your balance will not grow. Call your servicer to understand how the SAVE plan can help you reduce the cost of repaying your federal student loans.

Lower your payment by saving for retirement. Your IDR payment is based on your adjusted gross income (AGI). Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), decreases your AGI and your IDR payment too. This could increase the amount forgiven if you are pursuing loan forgiveness through PSLF or IDR.

Getting an IDR plan for Parent PLUS Loans

Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) is the only income-driven repayment plan available to Parent PLUS borrowers. Getting on ICR is also the best way to pursue Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for your Parent PLUS loans. On ICR, your loan balance will also be forgiven after 25 years.

Consolidation is the first step. Parent PLUS loans are not directly eligible for ICR. You must convert them into a Direct Consolidation loan, starting with this free application . The Education Department offers help before and during the consolidation process .

Do not consolidate other federal student loans with Parent PLUS loans. If you do, you will lose other benefits on those other loans, like access to other income-driven plans.

Once you have a consolidation loan, you can request ICR. You can submit your request online  or by calling your servicer.

Set a reminder to renew your enrollment next year. If you fail to recertify your income and household size  , your monthly payment will revert to a payment based on the standard, 10-year payment schedule. Parent Plus borrowers recertify by logging in to your federal student aid account .

Your total loan balance can grow on ICR. If your monthly payment does not cover the accrued interest, your loan balance will go up, even though you’re making payments. Unpaid interest will also capitalize each year until your total balance is 10% higher than the original balance. This means you will pay interest on your interest.

Exercise your rights as a servicemember

Your service counts towards public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). After you make 120 qualifying monthly payments under the PSLF program, you can apply to have your remaining loan balance forgiven, tax free. Learn more about your next steps from the PSLF Help Tool. 

Get your interest rate capped. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) entitles you to have your interest rate reduced to 6% on all debts taken out before your service began, including both federal and private student loans. Federal student loans can be reduced to 0% when you are serving in a hostile area. Reductions in federal student loan interest should happen automatically; check your statements to make sure. Contact your private student loan servicer to request a rate cap.

There are other benefits for active-duty servicemembers with Direct Loans. Check out our guide to student debt for servicemembers  and ED's guide to federal loan benefits for servicemembers. 

Avoid scams and wasting money

Don’t use credit cards or home equity to pay off student loans. Credit cards will cost you way more in interest. If you refinance your loans using home equity and run into trouble paying your mortgage, you could lose your house. Either way, you will lose the flexible repayment options and borrower protections offered by federal student loans.

Don’t go back to school just to avoid loan payments. Even during in-school deferment, your unsubsidized loans will accrue interest. Carefully compare the costs and benefits of more education. Unless it will increase your earnings, more debt could make your financial situation harder in the long run.

Watch out for scams. You may get letters, emails, calls, or text messages advertising loan forgiveness, but you can check those offers against the only federal student loan forgiveness programs.  Never share your loan or bank information, or your studentaid.gov login. Learn the other warning signs of student loan scams.

Don’t pay for help with your student loans. Many companies sell support services, including filling out forms. These services, however, will charge you a fee for something you can do for free.

Free, qualified help is available. Credit counseling nonprofits, which are different from credit repair companies, can help you make a plan to get out of debt. You can look for one near you by searching “credit counseling nonprofit” with the name of your city or town. You can also search for “free student loan advice.”

Take action when you run into problems

First, contact your servicer. Below are some questions to consider asking in different situations. If you’re unsure if the answers you receive are accurate, call back and talk to a different customer service rep, or ask to speak to the servicer’s supervisor.

Questions to ask your servicer about rehabilitation and consolidation
Questions to ask your servicer about pausing student loan payments
You have other options for help
If you have a problem with a student loan, you can also submit a complaint to the CFPB about federal or private student loans.
You can file a complaint with Federal Student Aid  about federal loans. These complaints can be escalated to the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group  .
Contact your state attorney general to file a complaint . Your state may also have a student loan ombudsman. Search the name of your state with “student loan ombudsman.”

Your financial well-being, or overall financial situation, is unique to you. Often, we equate how well we’re doing financially with how much money we make, our credit score, or overall net worth. In reality, your financial well-being is determined by factors that tell a larger story about your relationship to money. This includes how well you’re able to stay on top of your financial obligations, how secure you feel about your financial future, and ultimately whether you have the freedom to make financial choices that allow you to enjoy your life.

The story you tell about your finances doesn’t need to be a scary one. This October, during Financial Planning Month, we’ve pulled together 25 easy-to-follow tips for getting a handle on your money and improving your overall financial well-being. It starts with getting a realistic picture of where your money is coming from and where it’s going. Then, we walk you through how to stay on top of your finances so you can plan—and save—for the future. 

How would you rate your financial well-being? Get started by taking our quiz, and join us online throughout October by following #FinancialPlanningMonth and sharing these tips and tools.

Understand where your money goes 

The prequel to your financial story begins with a look into your past and current finances. What do you spend money on, and where are you getting your income? By tracking these factors, you can get a better sense of your financial picture today so you can plan for the future.

1. Take our quiz to see how healthy your finances are.

Answer just 10 questions to measure your financial well-being and get a few steps for making improvements. Take it now, then take it again later to see if your story has changed.

2. Learn where your money is coming from.

Before you can make any improvements, you need to get an accurate picture of your finances. Start by tracking your sources of income.

3. Learn where your money is going.

Fill out our spending tracker to get a sense of your regular expenses. To get a handle on your money, you need a system that will allow you to track your daily spending on an ongoing basis. Find and stick to a system that works best for you.

4. Write your bill due dates on a calendar.

If you have trouble making ends meet at the end of the month, the timing of your income and expenses may be off. It’s often helpful to see the full picture. Write down the due dates for your bills on a printed calendar that you can look at regularly as you plan for the weeks ahead.

Small changes can make a big difference

There are some easy steps you can take to turn the corner on your finances. Once you have an accurate picture of your money, follow these tips to start aligning your expenses to your income. 

5. Create a working budget that matches your cash flow.

Your cash flow is the timing of when money comes in and when it goes out. Looking at it on a week-by-week basis, especially if you tend to run short, can help you create a working monthly budget .

6. Request due dates for your bills that help you stay on track.

If there are certain weeks when money is especially tight, you can contact your creditors and utility companies and request new due dates that better align with your income .

7. Compare your spending month-to-month.

Track your spending closely for several months. By looking at your spending in real-time and comparing it to the previous month , you’ll start to see places where you can make adjustments and move money into savings.

Save for emergencies

Saving money might feel out of reach at times, but consistently putting away even small amounts of money can make a big impact over time. Check out our tips for making saving a part of your everyday routine, and then watch it grow. 

8. Give yourself financial security with an emergency savings fund.

Start by putting aside what you can afford in order to help cover many common emergencies, such as a car repair or medical bill, that could otherwise become costly debt. Prioritize a dedicated savings account for these unexpected expenses as one of your top savings goals, and as you get a better handle on your overall financial situation, you may decide to set more aside.

9. Set rules for your emergency savings–but don’t be afraid to use it.

Set guidelines for yourself for when you can spend down this savings fund and what constitutes an emergency, but if you need it, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s what it’s there for. Just remember to work to rebuild it.

10. Make saving easy by making it automatic.

Whether it’s through your bank or employer, there are a number of ways to have money automatically transferred into your savings every week or month. Reoccurring transfers are considered one of the most effective ways to build your savings.

11. Put extra money into savings at times when you have it.

There may be weeks when money is tighter than others. Take the opportunity to put money into savings when you have it.

12. Use your tax refund to help you reach financial goals.

For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. Make a plan now to dedicate a portion of that money to saving for some of your larger financial or savings goals.

Reduce your debt 

Paying down debt can seem scary or tough, but with some proven strategies, you can make it happen, bit by bit. Our tips for reducing debt can help you find the right methods to trim your debt into something that feels manageable.

13. Before making a plan to pay down your debts, know what you owe.

Use our debt log  to get a sense of the amount of debt you owe, including interest rate and projected payoff date, and who you owe it to.

14. Choose a debt reduction strategy that works best for you.

There are two common strategies to pay down your debt: the highest interest-rate method and the snowball method. Learn the differences and pick the one that works best for you.

15. Learn about federal and private student loans repayment options.

Whether you have federal or private student loans, or a mix of the two, start with the loans you’re most concerned with, and learn how to optimize paying them off.

16. In the market for a car? Negotiating can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

Plan ahead, and learn what’s negotiable.

Create better money habits 

Improving how you manage your money on a daily basis may take time and dedication, but as you develop better money habits, you’ll create a financial story that you’re proud of. 

17. Apply only for credit you need.

While it’s not the only factor, a good credit score is key to your financial well-being. One way to get and keep a good credit score is to apply only for credit you need.

18. Set an annual reminder to check your credit reports.

You’re entitled to free credit reports every 12 months, so set up an annual reminder to review them for any errors that may be hurting your credit and should be fixed.

19. Set up alerts to stay on top of your checking account balance.

Through most banks and credit unions, you’re able to set up alerts to notify you of your checking account balance at the end of the week or if your balance gets low. This helps you monitor your accounts and also protects you from incurring additional overdraft fees.

20. If you can’t make a bill payment, act fast and call your creditors.

Missing a bill payment can have several negative financial impacts. If you’re experiencing a financial emergency, contact your lenders or creditors before your due date to see what options may be available to you.

21. When shopping for a loan, get quotes from at least three lenders.

One of the best ways to save money on a loan is to shop around and get estimates from several lenders to best compare terms and fees. This is true for home loans as well as other types of loans, including auto loans.

Plan for success

Planning ahead is always helpful, and once you get a handle on your current financial picture, set some goals for what comes next. By building a plan, you have a roadmap to help guide you through the rest of your story. 

22. When planning for the future, set SMART financial goals.

Break down your financial goals  so that they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. While dreams tend to be aspirational and often vague, setting actionable SMART goals can help you reach your dreams.

23. Set up a 529 savings plan for your children.

If you have young children, college may seem far off, but to help reduce their need for student loans, a 529 plan is an investment account where your money can grow tax-free.

24. Make your savings consistent.

Putting even a small amount into savings on a consistent basis is one of the best ways to get your savings to grow so you can meet your goals, small or large. Set your own personal savings rule to live by and make a plan on how to achieve it .

25. Prepare for life events and large purchases by planning ahead.

Once you get a handle on your finances, you can start to map out life events and large purchases , so you can begin saving!

If you’ve taken some time to work through these tips, starting with our financial well-being quiz, we encourage you to go back and take it again at the end of October. Improving your financial health and well-being takes time, but the more you know, the more empowered you’ll be to make informed decisions that’ll improve your financial future.

Prepared Remarks of Richard Cordray
Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Field Hearing on Student Loan Debt

May 8, 2013

Good evening, and thank you for joining us for our field hearing on student loan debt. It has long been ingrained in the fabric of our country that if you work hard, study well, and act responsibly, you can get ahead in life. Benjamin Franklin once said, “An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.” From a young age, we impress upon our children that education can be an important milestone on the pathway to opportunity. That has been true in my own life, and I am sure it is true for many people here in this room.

But a college degree has the potential to become more of a burden than a blessing for those saddled with unmanageable debt in a tough employment market. We have heard from frustrated borrowers across the country. Thousands of private student loan borrowers feel like they have hit a wall. The unfortunate reality is that many private loans do not have the same affordable payment options as federal loans. Many private student loan borrowers have run out of options and are struggling to make ends meet. Student debt has become the defining feature of their lives – the millstone around their necks that holds them back from a full financial future. One borrower, Samantha, told us that she feels like she is “trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose.”

Last year, the Bureau released a study describing practices in the private student loan market that resembled some of the practices in the subprime market for mortgage lending before the financial crisis. Although it appears that those practices may have subsided and new borrowers may not face the same risks, many who took out those high-rate loans remain stuck.

We have also received complaints and stories from thousands of borrowers who have run into trouble repaying their private student loans. They feel trapped by high interest rates and some are frustrated about being unable to navigate issues through their loan servicer. We have seen especially shameful examples of poor servicing performance as servicemembers try to obtain the benefits they have earned under the law, but find themselves thwarted by burdensome paperwork and other obstacles. Many of these borrowers did everything right; they worked hard and made years of monthly payments, but still cannot find any refinancing options to get out of those high-rate loans.

This sounds uncomfortably familiar. When I was a local and then a state official in Ohio, I saw homeowners who hit a rough patch and ended up facing similar circumstances. They were not trying to escape their debt, they just wanted to work out a reasonable deal with their mortgage servicer, but no one would help. Consumers were trapped in exotic mortgages with few options, and the repercussions were felt through the economy. We learned a hard lesson in the wake of the mortgage meltdown.

We cannot just sit by and watch this happen to people again.

The Consumer Bureau was created in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Identifying emerging risks to consumers and our economy is an important part of our mission. So we are concerned that unmanageable student loan debt may be harmful to recovering consumer markets and may be dragging down borrowers’ lives. In February, we asked the public how student debt is affecting individual consumers as well as the broader economy, and what should be done about borrowers seeking to lower their payments on private student loans.

***

The response was overwhelming. We heard from nearly 30,000 Americans who wanted to see Washington try to do something to address this issue. Many told us about their day-to-day struggles with expensive loans and steep monthly payments. They also described the life choices they were forced to make in order to stay current on their loans. Many of them are postponing or forgoing major financial milestones like living on their own, starting a family, or buying a home. Others tried to put those choices into context by describing how high monthly student loan payments can diminish personal savings or crowd out other types of consumer spending. What is clear is that the overhang of high student loan debt can constrict the choices many young graduates are able to make about their careers and the communities in which they live.

The potential domino effect of these choices is a particular concern in the housing market. For example, consumers with student loans traditionally had higher rates of home ownership than those without. Because student loans were an indicator of higher levels of education, those consumers typically had higher income and were therefore more likely to buy a home. Today, however, we are seeing some student loan borrowers shying away from such investments. We heard from one borrower, Debra, who said plainly, “I can’t buy a house because of my student loan. I have to rent.” Daria was another who told us, “These loans are stunting my growth as a citizen. No car. No home.”

Census data tells us that nearly six million Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 lived with their parents in 2011. The National Association of Realtors estimates that this age group made up a mere 27 percent of all homebuyers in 2011, the lowest share in the past decade. First-time homebuyers play a critical role in the market by increasing demand and facilitating “move-up” purchases by existing homeowners. Some of the current generation of first-time homebuyers carries record levels of student debt – and this may inhibit their ability to qualify for a mortgage. On top of that, their high monthly loan payments make it hard to save for a down payment.

We heard that the consequences of high student loan debt do not end with the housing markets. College degrees have helped many people start new businesses over the years, and they continue to do so today. Yet the overhang of substantial debt may also stifle innovation and discourage the formation of new businesses by young people. In any business, it is critical to invest funds to hire employees and market your product. But when you are saddled with sky-high monthly student loan payments, those funds can be hard to come by or even qualify for.

Some commenters noted that unmanageable student debt limits their ability to access small business credit. Student debt burdens may require them to divert cash away from their business so they can make monthly student loan payments. Columba was one respondent who told us, “Student debt has pushed [off] my goal to open a small business by not allowing me to save enough money or even [qualify] for a business loan.”

The economic implications of student loan debt spill well beyond housing and small business development and into retirement savings as well. One woman told us that she had to turn to her mother, who was trying to save for retirement, to help her pay down her student loans. Recent research revealed that only half of workers under 30 have enrolled in their employer’s 401(k) plan and barely four out of ten contribute enough to receive a full employer match. We are concerned that those struggling with high student debt today will have no retirement savings to fall back on in the future.

If the consequences of student debt weigh down individuals and economic markets, it is inevitable that they hold back communities as well. Rural areas in particular struggle to attract and retain doctors, nurses, and other young professionals. In many of these communities, car ownership is a prerequisite for employment and rental housing may be scarce. Young consumers bowing under large debt loads may be unable or unwilling to buy a car or a home. The necessity of doing either may be enough to dissuade them from settling in rural communities.

This week is National Teacher Appreciation Week. I can think of many teachers in my life – and I am sure you can too – who made a strong positive impact on my future. But student debt is hitting teachers too. The problems posed for communities can be seen in the many letters we received from teachers, who often have low starting salaries that increase slowly over time. As a result, their high student loan balances can easily become a permanent fixture in their lives. One teacher who wrote us has been teaching for 12 years and still has over $75,000 in remaining student loan debt. She said that because she has chosen to teach, she does “not make enough money to get in front of [her] student loan debt.”

We received comments noting that programs to make student debt more manageable could lead to higher retention of quality teachers. A school district official described the lack of options on private student loans as a threat to keeping good teachers. She told us “this leaves many of our staff members with high student loan payments that may prevent them from staying in the teaching profession.” So not only does student loan debt affect borrowers’ financial lives, but it may reverberate in profoundly harmful ways through our education system, our communities, and the entire American economy.

***

Consumers told us how high monthly payments have left them trapped by their private student loan debt. They told us how this debt has forced them to sacrifice many of the features of middle-class American life. We heard about how these sacrifices have snowballed to the point where they pose a growing risk to other sectors of the economy. And many offered possible solutions to make private student loan debt more manageable.

The Consumer Bureau will be doing its part. We recently proposed a rule that would allow the agency to oversee many of the country’s larger student loan servicers. This oversight would allow us to keep a watchful eye over any servicing company that engages in unfair or deceptive acts or practices toward student loan borrowers. We will also continue to cooperate with the Justice Department to hold accountable those who violate the rights of our women and men in uniform. This is certainly something. But the public told us resoundingly that more can be done.

The comments we received identify some potential policy and market-based solutions to help struggling borrowers with unmanageable private student loan debt. The solutions target three specific problems. First, market participants, policy experts, and individual borrowers suggest that “refi relief” could be an option to help borrowers with expensive private student loans who have done everything right. Second, a number of people propose a “road to recovery” for borrowers who are in distress on their private student loans. Third, many others outline the need for a “credit clean slate” applicable to borrowers in default on their private student loans – like the rehabilitation option already available to some borrowers with federal student loans. Let me describe each of these ideas in somewhat greater detail.

For borrowers who have dutifully managed to make their monthly payments on high-interest private student loans, one of the ideas that policymakers and market participants could consider is providing “refi relief” for student loan borrowers. This approach could give responsible borrowers the opportunity to refinance their debt at market interest rates.

This approach would make sense because students often apply for private student loans when they are young, have scanty credit history, and have little or no income. Lenders must also consider the possibility that borrowers may not graduate or find a job with a salary that allows them to meet their monthly payments. As a result, lenders price new private student loans as if all young borrowers with limited credit present equally high credit risk, and the interest rate on their loans reflects those assumptions by coming in at consistently higher levels.

As a matter of fact, many of those borrowers do manage to finish school, get a good paying job, and make their payments on time. Nonetheless, they are still paying the interest rate of someone who did not yet have any of these attributes. If these borrowers could refinance, their debt would be much more manageable. Given today’s historically low interest rates, there is a tremendous opportunity for lenders to take advantage of an underserved market. Some people noted in their comments that a robust refinance market for private student loans could provide a break for consumers who have better credit than when they first borrowed and now deserve to have a fair shot at qualifying for lower interest rates.

Another proposal could apply to borrowers in distress, including those who have fallen behind on private loans. Here, people suggested the option of providing distressed borrowers with a road to recovery. One of the reasons private student loan debt can pose such a challenge for consumers is that these loans have less repayment flexibility and other borrower protections than federal student loans. Most private loans have few options available for alternative payment plans, but those who commented said that if lenders had more incentive to work with borrowers trapped in debt, both could benefit. So policymakers might consider creating a potential path forward for those borrowers: a transparent, step-by-step process with affordable payment terms where monthly payments are lowered to match a reasonable debt-to-income ratio.

Some borrowers, however, may need more than just alternative payment options. They may already be in default with severely damaged credit. Damaged credit can be a huge roadblock for consumers, making it impossible for them to borrow money for any other purpose, including the pursuit of even their most sensible aspirations. Some in the industry contend that policymakers should create a way for borrowers to repair their credit and get out of default – what might be called a “credit clean slate.”

Something similar already exists for borrowers with federal student loans – a program that can limit some of the negative credit effects of default. With the option of a clean slate, consumers may be able to qualify for a mortgage or an auto loan that otherwise would have been denied, which could open up new paths forward for them to get a firmer foothold to climb the economic ladder.

***

Everyone who cares about the future of this country should be focused closely on the many problems posed by a growing student loan debt burden borne by some of our best young people. What is at stake is whether some of our most motivated and ambitious citizens – who have the talent to make something of themselves, and lack only the means – will be able to rise and form part of the future leadership of this nation. If instead their hopes and dreams are diverted, discouraged, and defeated by the crushing burdens of a debt that ruins their prospects, we all will be poorer as a result.

So this problem should be sounding an alarm bell for all Americans.

At the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we have been working to address the student debt problem from a variety of angles. We have an array of online tools and resources to help students and their families navigate the complicated college financing process. Whether someone is just starting to think about paying for college or has already graduated and is grappling with loan payments, we have new tools to help inform these decisions. But we know that much more needs to be done to help private student loan borrowers who are finding that they are running out of options.

The ideas discussed today are just a few examples of the ways in which policymakers and market participants can work with borrowers to help manage their student loan debt. The pursuit of higher education should not become an insurmountable roadblock to opportunity for many of our fellow citizens. Indeed, it should be the very opposite: it should be a pathway to progress and personal development that strengthens our society.

At the Consumer Bureau, we are committed to helping students understand debt before they take it on, helping them manage their debt once they have incurred it, and addressing complaints and concerns they may have about their lenders or loan servicers. When we create more options to empower consumers to make responsible decisions about their debt, we all can benefit. But we can clearly see the gravity of what is at stake, not just for these young people, but for all of us, and we must feel the growing urgency around these issues.

I look forward to a vigorous discussion about student loans this evening and to hearing from all of you. Thank you.

What is an emergency fund?

An emergency fund is a cash reserve that’s specifically set aside for unplanned expenses or financial emergencies. Some common examples include car repairs, home repairs, medical bills, or a loss of income.

In general, emergency savings can be used for large or small unplanned bills or payments that are not part of your routine monthly expenses and spending.




Why do I need it?

Without savings, a financial shock—even minor—could set you back, and if it turns into debt, it can potentially have a lasting impact.

Research suggests that individuals who struggle to recover from a financial shock have less savings to help protect against a future emergency. They may rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to debt that’s generally harder to pay off. They may also pull from other savings, like retirement funds, to cover these costs.

Get a sense of your financial well-being

Take our quiz




How much do I need in it?

The amount you need to have in an emergency savings fund depends on your situation. Think about the most common kind of unexpected expenses you’ve had in the past and how much they cost. This may help you set a goal for how much you want to have set aside.

If you’re living paycheck to paycheck or don’t get paid the same amount each week or month, putting any money aside can feel difficult. But, even a small amount can provide some financial security.

Keep reading to find the savings strategy, or strategies, that work best for you.




How do I build it?

There are different strategies to get your savings started. These strategies cover a range of situations, including if you have a limited ability to save or if your pay tends to fluctuate. It may be that you could use all of these strategies, but if you have a limited ability to save, managing your cash flow or putting away a portion of your tax refund are the easiest ways to get started.

Strategy: Create a savings habit

Building a savings of any size is easier when you’re able to consistently put money away. It’s one of the fastest ways to see it grow. If you’re not in a regular practice of saving, there are a few key principles to creating and sticking to a savings habit:

Set a goal. Having a specific goal for your savings  can help you stay motivated. Establishing your emergency fund may be that achievable goal that helps you stay on track, especially when you’re initially getting started. Use our savings planning tool  to calculate how long it’ll take you to reach your goal, based on how much and how often you’re able to put money away.
Create a system for making consistent contributions. There are a number of different ways to save, and as you’ll read below, setting up automatic recurring transfers is often one of the easiest. It may also be that you put a specific amount of cash aside each day, week, or payday period. Aim to make it a specific amount, and if you can occasionally afford to do more, you’ll watch your savings grow even faster.
Regularly monitor your progress. Find a way to regularly check your savings. Whether it’s an automatic notification of your account balance or writing down a running total of your contributions, finding a way to watch your progress can offer gratification and encouragement to keep going.
Celebrate your successes. If you’re sticking with your savings habit, don’t miss the opportunity to recognize what you’ve accomplished. Find a few ways that you can treat yourself, and if you’ve reached your goal, set your next one.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. If you know you have a regular paycheck or money consistently coming in, you can create a habit to put some of that money towards an emergency savings fund.




Strategy: Manage your cash flow


Your cash flow  is essentially the timing of when your money is coming in (your income) and going out (your expenses and spending). If the timing is off, you can find yourself running short at the end of the week or month, but if you’re actively tracking it, you’ll start to see opportunities to adjust your spending and savings .

For example, you may be able to work with your creditors (like your landlord, utility companies, or credit card companies) to adjust the due dates for your bills, or you can use the weeks when you have more money available to move a little extra into savings.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone. This is one important first step in managing your money, regardless of whether you’re living paycheck to paycheck or have a tendency to spend more than your budget allows.




Strategy: Take advantage of one-time opportunities to save

There may also be certain times during the year when you get an influx of money. For many Americans, a tax refund can be one of the largest checks they receive all year. There may be other times of the year, like a holiday or birthday, that you receive a cash gift.

While it’s tempting to spend it, saving all or a portion of that money could help you quickly set up your emergency fund.


Who is this helpful for: Anyone but particularly those with irregular income. If you receive a large check from a tax refund or for some other reason, it’s always good to consider putting all or a portion of it away into savings.

Create a savings plan for your tax refund 




Strategy: Make your saving automatic


Saving automatically is one of the easiest ways to make your savings consistent so you start to see it build over time. One common way to do this is to set up recurring transfers through your bank or credit union so money is moved automatically from your checking account to your savings account. You get to decide how much and how often, but once you have it set up, you’ll be making consistent contributions to your savings.

It’s a good idea to be mindful of your balances, however, so you don’t incur overdraft fees if there’s not enough money in your checking account at the time of the automatic transaction. To help you stay mindful, consider setting up automatic notifications or calendar reminders to check your balance.

Who is this helpful for: Anyone, but particularly those with consistent income. Again, you can determine how much and how often to have money transferred between accounts, but you want to make sure you have money coming in. If your situation changes or your income changes, you can always adjust it.




Strategy: Save through work

Another way to save automatically is through your employer. In addition to employer-based contributions for retirement, you may have an option to split your paycheck between your checking and savings accounts. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, check with your employer to see if it’s possible to divide it between two accounts. If you’re tempted to spend your paycheck when you get it, this is an easy way to put money aside without having to think twice.

Who is this helpful for: Those with consistent income. Again, if you’re getting a check from your employer on a regular basis, pay yourself first by putting a portion of it automatically into savings.




Where should I keep it?

Where you put your emergency fund depends on your situation. You want to make sure this fund is safe, accessible, and in a place where you’re not tempted to spend it on non-emergencies.

Here are a few options for where to put your emergency savings, and you can choose the one that makes the most sense for you:


Bank or credit union account — If you have an account with a bank or credit union—generally considered one of the safest places to put your money—it might make sense to have a dedicated account where you can keep and maintain these funds.
Prepaid card — A prepaid card is a card that you can load money onto. It’s not connected with a bank or credit union, and you can only spend the amount that’s on your card.
Cash — Another option is keeping money on hand for emergencies, either in your home or with a trusted family member or friend. Keep in mind that cash can be stolen, lost, or destroyed.




When should I use it?

Set some guidelines for yourself on what constitutes an emergency or unplanned expense. Not every unexpected expense is a dire emergency but try to stay consistent. Even if it’s not a trip to the emergency room, you may need it to pay for a medical bill that wasn’t covered by insurance.

Having a reserve fund for financial shocks can help you avoid relying on other forms of credit or loans that can turn into debt. If you use a credit card or take out a loan to pay for these expenses, your one-time emergency expense may grow significantly larger than your original bill because of interest and fees.

However, don’t be afraid to use it if you need it. If you spend down what’s in your emergency savings, just work to build it up again. Practicing your savings skills over time will make this easier.

Deceptive marketing practices about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer
Question presented

When do remittance transfer providers violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) in their marketing about the speed and cost of sending a remittance transfer?

Response

Remittance transfer providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer. Providers may be liable under the CFPA for deceptive marketing practices regardless of whether the provider is in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Remittance Rule. For example, among other things, it may be deceptive to:

Market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients;
Market remittance transfers as “no fee” when in fact the provider charges fees;
Market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when an offer is temporary or limited;
Market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free.
Background
Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Pursuant to the CFPB’s Remittance Rule,1 the term “remittance transfer” includes most electronic transfers of funds sent by consumers in the United States to recipients in other countries. Consumers in the United States send hundreds of billions of dollars in remittance transfers to recipients in foreign countries each year.2 Remittance transfers are often consumer-to-consumer transfers of money by immigrants sending financial support to family and friends in other countries. They also include other types of transfers, such as transfers by consumers in the United States to Americans living temporarily abroad, such as students. Consumers may send remittance transfers regularly as an ongoing source of financial assistance or in other circumstances, such as an occasional or emergency form of support. Remittance transfers also include cross-border consumer-to-business payments for goods or services.

Consumers may choose among a range of bank, credit union, and non-bank money transmitters when sending a remittance transfer. Non-bank money transmitters have traditionally dominated the market for remittance transfers from the United States. In recent years, new money transmitters have emerged offering digital remittance transfer services. Many established money transmitters have also added digital services, in addition to in-person options for consumers to go to a store or agent to send remittance transfers.3

When sending remittance transfers, consumers may consider a number of key factors when deciding among different providers, including the speed of the transfer and its cost as well as convenience, security, reliability, and trust.4

The speed of a remittance transfer varies depending on the type of transfer and provider. The World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide database illustrates that a range of transfer speeds can exist within a given remittance corridor, with some providers, for example, offering delivery in less than an hour, and others offering delivery in three to five days.5

Costs can also vary significantly within a remittance corridor. Remittance transfer costs include fees charged by the remittance transfer provider including, if applicable, their agents and third parties. Costs also include any exchange rate costs applied by the provider to the currency conversion and governmental taxes. The exchange rate offered to consumers often reflects a spread – meaning, a percentage difference between the retail exchange rate offered to the consumer and some wholesale exchange rate.6 Remittance transfer providers utilize different pricing strategies when determining the fees and exchange rate they charge to consumers for remittance transfers.

Transparency Concerns Around Remittance Transfer Speed and Costs

Prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), federal consumer protection laws generally did not apply to remittances, and remittance transfer providers were not consistently required to disclose applicable fees, exchange rates, transfer speeds, and the amount to be received in a transaction. Consumers thus did not always know how much money would be received on the other end and were not able to easily comparison shop among providers.

With the Dodd-Frank Act’s amendments to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the promulgation of the Remittance Rule, remittance transfer providers are now generally required to disclose certain information to consumers before the consumer pays for a transfer and also when payment is made.7 Before the consumer pays for a transfer, the information a remittance transfer provider must disclose includes (but is not limited to): as applicable, the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded; any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer; the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of the amount that will be transferred and any fees imposed and any taxes collected, in the funding currency; the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer; any covered third-party fees; and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The receipt that consumers generally receive when payment is made must contain the same information. In addition, the receipt must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient.

Compliance with the Remittance Rule disclosure requirements does not obviate the obligation to refrain from misleading marketing practices. In particular, remittance transfer providers must ensure their marketing practices do not violate the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in the CFPA.8

The CFPB has identified problems with transparency and accuracy in marketing practices about the speed of a remittance transfer in its supervision of remittance transfer providers and enforcement of the CFPA’s prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. In the CFPB’s Spring 2022 Supervisory Highlights, the CFPB discussed examiners’ findings that remittance transfer providers made false and misleading representations about the speed of remittance transfers.9 In October 2023, the CFPB issued a consent order against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, finding that the remittance transfer provider made misleading statements in advertisements about the speed and cost of its services, in violation of the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices.10 This provider claimed in social media marketing that remittance transfers would be delivered “instantly,” in “30 seconds” or “within seconds,” and would incur “no fees,” when in fact transfers often took much longer, and the provider charged a fee.11

In addition, consumers have reported, and the CFPB has observed, problems with price transparency in the marketing practices of remittance transfer providers, resulting in consumers encountering unexpected costs.12 The CFPB has received consumer complaints about promotional pricing by remittance transfer providers who do not sufficiently inform consumers that the advertised fee or exchange rate is only a limited scope or temporary offer. The CFPB has also observed marketing claims by remittance transfer providers that may mislead consumers about the scope or duration of a temporary low or “no fee” offer or promotional exchange rate.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about marketing that omits or obscures the cost of a remittance transfer. Marketing claims by remittance transfer providers may fail to communicate the full cost of a remittance transfer, such as advertising that transfers are “free” or advertising that prominently emphasizes zero fees while only including a vaguely worded statement that additional costs related to the exchange rate may apply. Some of these statements use technical jargon or feature confusing language.

The CFPB has also received consumer complaints about companies that market “free” remittance transfers through digital wallet and other prepaid products, but that fail to sufficiently disclose costs for currency conversion or for withdrawing funds from the product. Companies that offer remittance transfers through digital wallets and other prepaid products often market them as a faster and cheaper way to send remittance transfers. Certain companies’ websites market “free account-to-account transfers” or that “receiving money from a friend” is free. Providers may disclose only in fine print, however, that these transfers are only free when there is no currency conversion, and that for the recipient to withdraw and use funds in their local currency, they must pay a currency conversion fee. In addition, some digital wallet providers may not make clear that recipients of a remittance transfer must pay a fee to withdraw funds from the digital wallet or other prepaid product. Examples of such fees include fees to transfer funds to an external bank account, credit card, or prepaid card. Consumers have complained to the CFPB that these fees are unexpected when they convert currencies and withdraw funds transmitted through digital wallets and other prepaid products.13

Analysis

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for a provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in deceptive acts or practices.14 A representation, omission, act, or practice is deceptive if it misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is reasonable under the circumstances; and the misleading representation, omission, act, or practice is material.15

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to be made available to recipients

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as being delivered within a certain time frame, when transfers actually take longer to reach recipients. The CFPB “presumes that express claims are material.”16 Furthermore, as noted above, the speed of a remittance transfer is often a crucial consideration for consumers sending remittance transfers.17 Recipients may rely on remittance transfers for day-to-day expenses or for time-sensitive emergencies.

As illustrated in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, marketing claims about the speed of remittance transfers may violate the prohibition on deceptive acts or practices under the CFPA when the actual time for delivery is longer than advertised.

In the Sendwave case, the provider told consumers that transfers would be delivered “instantly,” “in 30 seconds,” or “within seconds.” These statements were false and misleading because, although a reasonable customer might expect delivery within the time frame advertised, in many instances, transfers were not actually delivered instantly or within seconds for many consumers.18 In addition, as an express marketing statement regarding a central characteristic of the product – when funds would be available to a recipient – the misleading representation was material.19

Providers must thus take care not to engage in deceptive acts or practices in their marketing claims about the speed of a remittance transfer.

It is deceptive to market transfers as “no fee” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer

Remittance transfer providers violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices if they market remittance transfers as having “no fee,” when in fact the remittance transfer provider charges consumers fees to send the remittance transfer. The cost of sending a remittance transfer is a central consideration for consumers,20 and, as discussed above, fees are an important component of the cost of a remittance transfer.21 Expressly misleading price claims violate the prohibition on deceptive practices.22

For example, as alleged in the CFPB’s action against Chime Inc., d/b/a Sendwave, from at least 2021 to 2022, Sendwave’s website advertised that consumers could transfer funds from the United States to Nigeria “with no fees.” In fact, consumers were charged fees on all transfers from the United States to Nigeria, despite Sendwave continuing to promote its product as having “no fees” on its website with no qualification or disclaimer.23

The CFPB found that Sendwave’s representations were likely to mislead the consumer and that the consumer’s interpretation would be reasonable under the circumstances. Although Sendwave disclosed a 1% transfer fee in the FAQ section of its website, this did not correct the misleading statement or communication made at the top of its webpage and on a graphic depicting its mobile app.24 And as an express marketing statement regarding a central consideration for consumers when sending a remittance transfer – cost –, the misleading representation about transfer fees was material.25

It may be deceptive to market promotional fees or promotional exchange rates for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying when the offer is only limited or temporary

Remittance transfer providers may violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by advertising promotional pricing for remittance transfers without sufficiently clarifying that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope, even if the promotional nature of the offer is disclosed in fine print or later in the transaction.26 In such cases, consumers may not understand the pricing is limited and promotional and they may not understand that the cost of sending a remittance transfer through the provider rises after the first or first few transactions.

As the CFPB has articulated, consumers may be reasonably misled when financial service providers fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose material terms in advertising, such as when and by how much charges will increase.27 Written disclosures or fine print in marketing materials would often be insufficient to correct a misleading statement or representation in marketing communications.28 When a consumer’s first contact with a remittance transfer provider involves deception, “the law may be violated even if the truth is subsequently made known” to the consumer.29

Representations in advertising about “no fee” remittance transfers or specific promotional exchange rates without sufficiently clarifying, when applicable, that the offer is only limited or temporary in scope are presumed to be material, as they relate to cost, a key consumer consideration.

In addition, such statements are likely to be material because of their likely impact on a consumer’s initial and subsequent choice of remittance transfer provider. The impact could be particularly significant for promotions offered to first-time customers who seek to continue using the provider to send remittance transfers. Such consumers may face unexpected higher costs after the expiration of the promotion and may also face unexpected hurdles in searching for a different provider. Had they been aware of the limited promotional nature of the offer, a reasonable consumer may have chosen a different provider.

It is deceptive to market remittance transfers as “free” if they are not in fact free

Remittance transfer providers would also violate the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by marketing remittance transfers as “free” if they are not actually free for the consumer. For example, it may be deceptive to market a remittance transfer as “free” if the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs on consumers through the exchange rate spread for the transfer or, with respect to digital wallets or other prepaid products, if the provider imposes costs to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product.

The FTC has articulated that, under the FTC Act, offers of “free” services “must be made with extreme care so as to avoid any possibility that consumers will be misled or deceived.”30 “The word ‘free’ is a lure. It is the bait. It is a powerful magnet that draws the best of us against our will ‘to get something for nothing.’” Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 48 F.T.C. 1297, 1312 (1952), aff’d, 202 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1953).

A consumer should generally expect that a “free” product or service is indeed free, and that the seller “will not directly and immediately recover, in whole or in part, the cost of [] the service.”31 The FTC has explained that terms, conditions, and obligations that apply to a “free” item should be set forth clearly, conspicuously, and in close conjunction with the offer of the “free” item, and they should further be made clear at the outset of the offer “so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood.”32 The same analysis applies to the use of terms that are similar to “free,” such as “gift” or “given without charge.”33

The FTC has recently reiterated that representations of “free” in marketing are deceptive when the offer is not in fact free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed, such that the claim is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer about information important to them when choosing a product.34 As applied here, marketing representations of remittance transfers as free are deceptive under the CFPA if they are not actually free or when limitations, restrictions, or hidden charges are inadequately disclosed.

Marketing a remittance transfer as “free” is likely to cause a reasonable consumer to believe they are sending a remittance transfer without the provider imposing a cost to the consumer. Such interpretation would be incorrect – but reasonable – in instances where the remittance transfer provider is imposing costs through the exchange rate spread for the transfer. In this situation, a remittance transfer provider’s claim that the transfer is “free” would be false and thus likely to be deceptive because there was a cost imposed on the transfer through the exchange rate spread.35

Remittance transfer providers should also be aware of the risk of deception when marketing “free” remittance transfers for digital wallets or other prepaid products. A claim that remittance transfers are “free” may be misleading if the provider in fact imposes costs for recipients to convert funds into a different currency or to withdraw funds from the product. In these circumstances, marketing “free” transfers may constitute a misrepresentation of the terms for the remittance transfer provider’s services that may mislead a reasonable consumer, even with subsequent disclosure of such fees.

About Consumer Financial Protection Circulars

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are issued to all parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the principal federal regulator responsible for administering federal consumer financial law, see 12 U.S.C. 5511, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices, 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B), and 18 other “enumerated consumer laws,” 12 U.S.C. 5481(12). However, these laws are also enforced by state attorneys general and state regulators, 12 U.S.C. 5552, and prudential regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5516(d), 5581(c)(2) (exclusive enforcement authority for banks and credit unions with $10 billion or less in assets). Some federal consumer financial laws are also enforceable by other federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Agriculture. In addition, some of these laws provide for private enforcement.

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are intended to promote consistency in approach across the various enforcement agencies and parties, pursuant to the CFPB’s statutory objective to ensure federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently. 12 U.S.C. 5511(b)(4). Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are also intended to provide transparency to partner agencies regarding the CFPB’s intended approach when cooperating in enforcement actions. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5552(b) (consultation with CFPB by state attorneys general and regulators); 12 U.S.C. 5562(a) (joint investigatory work between CFPB and other agencies).

Consumer Financial Protection Circulars are general statements of policy under the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. 553(b). They provide background information about applicable law, articulate considerations relevant to the Bureau's exercise of its authorities, and, in the interest of maintaining consistency, advise other parties with authority to enforce federal consumer financial law. They do not restrict the Bureau’s exercise of its authorities, impose any legal requirements on external parties, or create or confer any rights on external parties that could be enforceable in any administrative or civil proceeding. The CFPB Director is instructing CFPB staff as described herein, and the CFPB will then make final decisions on individual matters based on an assessment of the factual record, applicable law, and factors relevant to prosecutorial discretion.­

This blog was originally posted on April 3, 2020 and was updated on May 5, 2020.

If you’ve been on the fence about doing your banking online or through a mobile app, now is a good time to get started as financial institutions change their branch hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online and mobile banking allow you to handle your finances from the comfort of home.

Begin online banking with a few steps

As long as you have a computer or smartphone with access to the Internet and an account with a bank or credit union account eligible for internet banking, it’s easy to get started.

Gather your account numbers

Your account numbers should be on your paper statement. Your account number will also be on the bottom of your checks or deposit slips. They are needed to enroll your account.

Find your bank or credit union’s website

Look on one of your paper statements or on the back of your debit or credit card to find the website, rather than googling or clicking on links in an email or text. If you visit your bank’s website from your smartphone, you may be prompted to download the bank or credit union’s mobile app that you can use from your phone.

Register for access to your bank or credit union's online banking platform

The first time you visit, you’ll follow the prompts to create an online account. You will answer questions to prove it’s really you, choose a username and password, and set up security features and preferences . Be sure to create strong passwords and do not use the same password for all accounts. Don’t use information such as addresses and birthdays in your passwords. For more tips on how to create strong passwords read more from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) .

Log in and take a tutorial

If it’s offered by your bank or credit union to learn your way around the platform.

What can you do with online and mobile app banking?

Most transactions can be done online or through your financial institution’s mobile app on your smartphone.

Check your account balances online at any time. You now can catch errors such as unauthorized activity earlier – without having to wait for your paper statement. You usually can notify your bank or credit union account of errors through the online or mobile banking app or chat functions.
Often, you can see deposits and charges that are pending, meaning they have not posted to your account yet. Note that for pending debit card transactions, the amounts you see may not be the same as the final amount that posts to your account. Be sure to check your bank’s or credit union’s funds availability policy before assuming that pending deposits are available for making payments or withdrawals.
Consider whether you would like to continue to receive paper versions of your periodic statements and other documents. Your bank or credit union may prompt you to go paperless while you set up online banking.
Most banks and credit unions allow you to set up automatic notifications to help you manage your account and alert you when any of the following happen: a direct deposit is received, a large payment is charged, your balance falls below a certain amount, your account is in overdraft, and more. Often, bank and credit union online portals offer you the ability to sign up to get these alerts via text, email, or both. These alerts can help ensure you stay informed without having to log in to your account several times a day.
Most banks and credit unions will allow you to deposit checks using your smartphone and a mobile app. You might not be able to deposit all types of checks this way, so check with your bank or credit union if you have any questions. The mobile app makes it easy to deposit a check in a few steps:
Download your bank or credit union’s app on your smartphone if you haven’t already.
Understand any rules your bank or credit union has about mobile check deposit.
Follow the directions in the mobile app to deposit the check
Hold onto the check for several days after deposit until you are sure it has posted to your account meaning that it is no longer pending and any holds your institution has placed have expired.
Destroy the check once it’s cleared by shredding it or tearing or cutting it up.
If you need to transfer money between accounts, or even between financial institutions, your online banking or mobile app likely offers you options to do that. Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of your transfer and double check that you are using the correct account and routing numbers when making any transfers.
There’s a good chance your financial institution offers a way to send money person to person, too. Before you use any mobile payment services, check out our best practices guide to make sure your transactions are done safely. You can test it out by transferring a small amount, like a dollar, back and forth. That way you’ll be sure your money goes where you want and you receive money you’re owed.
Instead of writing checks and mailing them, you can pay most bills online or through the mobile app for your financial institution.
Banking online or through your mobile device is secure, as long as you follow best practices  for keeping the information on your mobile device safe. Your financial institution may offer additional services to help you keep your account safe, including turning off your debit card if you suspect fraud. Check with your bank or credit union to learn more about additional protections they may offer.
How do I get help with online banking?

If you run into any issues, ask for help! If you need specific guidance, contact your bank or credit union directly. Customer service associates are available by phone, online chat, or video in some cases. The financial institution staff will help you set up your account and answer questions. They will also help you figure out what you can and cannot do online or through their app. Please note that during this pandemic crisis, many bank and credit union call centers are experiencing high call volumes and may be delayed in responding to inquiries.

Helping someone else bank

If you are a financial caregiver, either in a traditional formal role of managing someone else’s money or on an informal basis, speak with the person you’re helping and their financial institution to determine what you can and cannot do. Keep in mind that even during the current national health emergency, you’ll have to follow all of the required steps to have access to another person’s account. That could include having documents prepared, notarized, or other more formal steps – and it could take some time due to the large volume of consumer inquiries financial institutions are receiving.

Some banks and credit unions offer “view-only” online banking, which lets you see what’s going on without having access to the money. If you are a fiduciary, you may be able to gain online access to accounts and help manage money while observing social distancing or quarantine practices.

If you do need to bank in person, call or visit your bank or credit union’s website to see if your branch is closed, offering special hours for older customers or members, offering services in person by appointment, or serving customers through the drive-thru windows only.

Here’s what you need to know.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-partner-8612447,"Having open conversations about finances is essential for any healthy romantic relationship. But no matter how long you’ve been lovebirds, bringing up money can feel awkward and uncomfortable.

A February 2023 study by Bread Financial found that baby boomers tend to discuss finances with their partners the least of any generation—only 13% of those surveyed admitted to talking about finances daily. Millennials were a different story; 39% claimed to discuss money daily with their partners. Yet, the study also found that “58% of millennials and 57% of Gen Z’ers report arguments with their partner over finances at least occasionally, whereas only 30% of boomers do the same.” 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Open communication about money is crucial for a healthy relationship.
Building trust about money matters and setting shared financial goals can strengthen your relationship.
Approach the conversation about money with empathy and understanding.
Create financial transparency by discussing income, expenses, and budgeting.

Not all money conversations are good ones, and there is such a thing as talking about the topic too much. Rather than prioritize frequency, it is best to focus on quality.

Certified financial planner R.J. Weiss says one of the easiest ways to start is to “Concentrate on future goals instead of past spending habits. Start with a question like, ‘What do we want our finances to look like in three years?’” This kind of open-ended question avoids finger pointing and provides a neutral starting point to discuss how each of you values money.

Regular and healthy talks about money can help you and your partner unpack financial fears and money scripts, as well as plan for financial independence and shared milestones.

Talking About Money Matters

A recent Forbes Advisor survey of 1,000 divorcees found that their number one reason for getting married was financial security (42%). Although finances didn’t top the reasons why they divorced, money matters played a significant role in common conflicts among couples who wound up divorcing. Forty-six percent reported career choices as the most prevalent topic of disagreement, while 43% said the division of household labor, and 28% named finances.

If not addressed proactively, money issues like conflicting spending habits, opposing views on saving and investing, and dead-end jobs can breed resentment over time. Keeping lines of communication open within couples is essential to the overall solvency of a committed relationship, but it is just the first step. Discussing spending priorities, savings goals, and debt management can help you find compromises and solutions as a team.

Next, you may need to have financial conversations with children, aging parents, ex-spouses, co-parents, business partners, and anyone else who relies on your household income. Setting priorities within your partnership can help you speak with one voice when discussing boundaries with dependents.

Establish a Foundation of Trust

Many people were raised to believe that talking about money is rude or taboo. Raising the topic of money before your relationship is on solid emotional ground can feel like a recipe for disaster.

Yet, early transparency around money can help you determine if this partnership is going to work in the long term. It is less about how much money is in each bank account and more about whether you both see eye to eye about how you spend, save, and value money.

Starting these conversations from a nonjudgmental place helps both partners feel safe to reveal the emotions behind their money habits and to shift to more sustainable patterns in the future.

Weiss says it’s best to make financial discussions a regular part of your relationship routine, at least monthly. This normalizes conversations—rather than arguments—about money. You can use a common monthly billing cycle as the anchor to review your numbers. If you want to dig deeper into concepts, you can agree to read a personal finance book or listen to a money-focused podcast and discuss it monthly.

These periodic check-ins are opportunities to disclose money woes and craft strategies together. There are also times to acknowledge wins like promotions, investment growth, and debt paydown. Knowing your partner can handle the good and the bad is really what healthy relationships are made of.

However, you must expect that these conversations are going to be emotional. Try not to lash out in fear or anger when gathering new information about your partner’s money hygiene. Also, don’t beat yourself up about any slip-ups throughout the month. Listen with empathy and devise a plan to set things right. The intention is to build a culture of accountability and discipline, not one of extreme austerity or shame.

It may take time and care, but openly sharing money experiences without blame ultimately builds trust and strengthens intimacy.

Get Excited About Shared Financial Goals

The best part of sharing a life with someone is the prospect of doing what you love with someone you love.

Chances are, shared interests are what brought you and your partner together in the first place. Hone in on the meaningful life events and accomplishments you’d like to share with each other, and build conversations around the part each of you will play in ensuring that those milestones come to pass.

Once you get past the initial awkwardness, setting shared money goals can be incredibly bonding.

“Couples should set goals both individually and together and should understand what each of them is trying to accomplish and work towards,” says Lawrence D. Sprung, a wealth advisor and the host of the Mitlin Money Mindset podcast. “Although income and salaries may be different, as long as your goals are aligned, the combined incomes should be viewed as being available towards both your individual goals [and your goals] as a couple.”

Talking about money with your partner ensures that you both have a solid game plan to advance your lives as a couple.

Use These Tips to Talk to Your Partner About Money


Choosing the right time and place for money discussions ensures a nonconfrontational and supportive environment to tackle what could be a sensitive topic for you or your partner. These are effective strategies for initiating a conversation about money with your partner:

Work Through the Details

At first glance, figuring out the nitty-gritty of budgeting and expenses together can feel really overwhelming.

To make combining your finances more manageable, both partners have to be honest about their incomes, debts, and other financial obligations. Excessive privacy or vagueness breeds mistrust. Trust that you can share the details with your partner and that they won’t judge you but instead serve as a supportive sounding board.

Married couples can file their U.S. taxes jointly or separately. While filing jointly is most common, filing separately can be advantageous if there are large differences in medical bills, debts, and income between partners. The details matter.

Discuss Debt

“The important thing here is to have an honest and transparent conversation about your respective debt,” Sprung says. “Put it all on the table and begin to have a conversation about who is going to take care of the debt, one of you or both, and put a plan together to start extinguishing it immediately so you can start off on a clean slate as a couple.”

Couples approach debt in various ways. Some combine finances and include premarital debt in their joint financial goals, while others choose not to work together to pay off individual debt.

“Another approach I’ve seen work is to split debt repayment based on each partner’s income level,” Weiss says. “This method makes a lot of sense when the partner with higher debt, often due to student loans, also has a higher income.”

If either of you is carrying debt from a prior relationship, expect that these discussions might be more heated than those related to the debt you accumulate together. Rely on the foundation of trust to create a plan that you both can commit to.

Use Technology

Gone are the days of spreadsheets and shoe boxes full of receipts. Instead, you can use trackers on your credit and bank cards to closely monitor spending. If you share cards, all the transactions will be visible and accessible to discuss at your monthly money meeting. If you want to combine your finances, try apps that combine bank accounts and track spending as you swipe. 

The budgeting app Mint switched to Credit Karma in 2024 and no longer offers the same budgeting features. However, it will keep past data around net worth and add new finance trackers. The EveryDollar app and YNAB (You Need a Budget) are paid alternatives.

To curb frivolous spending or celebrate debt paydown, you can agree to set spending alerts on your accounts. Establish autopay to avoid any penalties or late fees. Don’t rely solely on memory and willpower to reach your collective goals, especially long-term ones like retiring, buying a house, or paying off student loans and consumer debt.

Swap ‘Shoulds’ for ‘Coulds’

Personal finance conversations are often laden with regret, no matter how much or how little money a person has. Hindsight is 20/20, and most people recognize that they could have made smarter money decisions at some point.

Rather than focus on what you or your partner should have done in the past, focus on the future. Consider what you could do now and which strategies resonate most with your financial goals. When talking about money, trade past-oriented shoulds with forward-thinking coulds.

For example, instead of criticizing yourself (or your partner) for not sticking to the budget last month, focus on adjustments that will help you stay on track next month. Keep a positive and hopeful attitude when addressing household finances.

Don’t Wait

It is easy to put off money conversations, but don’t wait too long. It’s better to have early and regular communication about finances in flux than to wait for a perfect moment that isn’t likely to come.

There will always be a payment that hasn’t cleared or an account issue to troubleshoot. That’s the very purpose of having these conversations regularly. Together, you can build solid money habits within your partnership and share oversight of your financial life.

Make It an Occasion

“Make these conversations something you look forward to. I’ve seen couples order takeout from one of their favorite restaurants, get dressed up, or open a bottle of wine,” Weiss says.

These money chats on a date night can be great for confirming if your timeline for the future will match up with the growth of your savings and investment accounts. They can also mark money wins for one or both of you. And these enjoyable settings can mute the blow of financial setbacks.

However, these occasions aren’t ideal for crunching numbers or tackling highly sensitive points of contention. In both cases, you should work with a professional. Accountants, couples counselors, and even tax preparers should be consulted in their offices or in a quiet, private setting where you can get the most value from their expertise.

Seek Outside Help When Needed

Sometimes, you and your partner might feel stuck on money issues even after repeated constructive attempts to work through things together. To get unstuck, consider getting unbiased guidance from a financial professional. Certified experts are required to stay abreast of the latest trends, tools, and tactics to make the most of any situation.

If talks consistently get heated and communication breaks down, try couples counseling to have a neutral party on hand to moderate difficult conversations. A therapist can help reveal the root issues driving money conflicts and provide tools to discuss finances in a healthy manner.

Meeting with a couples financial advisor can offer an impartial outside perspective. An expert can assess your complete financial picture collaboratively and map out customized strategies to help you gain clarity on financial decisions or overcome hurdles.

Other professionals you should seek include career counselors, headhunters, investment advisors, bank account managers, and more.

How Can I Start the Money Talk without Causing a Fight?

Don’t spring it on your spouse or partner suddenly, and don’t come on too strong. Ease into it by mentioning that you’d like to set aside time to casually discuss your hopes and goals related to money. Pick a relaxed day without distractions. Frame it as a chance to dream together, not point fingers.

What Are Some Usual Challenges That Couples Have with Money?

Some of the most common money issues between couples include fears about the economy, saving vs. spending, and how to communicate about money, according to an Orion survey. Nearly half of couples surveyed said that they considered dishonesty about money a form of infidelity.

How Can Shared Goals Help?

Having a common vision to work toward builds unity and teamwork. It motivates you to compromise or make sacrifices for each other’s benefit. Having a singular and shared goal can also highlight your money strengths and weaknesses. Together, you can improve habits that will sustain your relationship.

Are There Resources for Managing Money as a Couple?

Yes. Try apps like Honeydue or Zeta. They help couples budget and track finances together. Sites like CoupleWise offer courses and tips. Or meet with a financial advisor or counselor for personalized guidance.

When Should We Seek Outside Help with Money Issues?

If you constantly argue about the same topics, don’t struggle alone. Seek counseling or financial help. Money is a top cause of relationship problems, but professionals can help.

What Are Financial Red Flags in a Partner That I Shouldn’t Ignore?

Secrecy about money, uncontrolled spending, reckless gambling or investing, avoiding paying debts, and repeated unwillingness to discuss finances openly can be problematic. Use caution if these are ongoing concerns.

The Bottom Line

Transparent communication is crucial for a healthy relationship, money talks included.

Start with trust and empathy. These early discussions can focus on establishing a baseline of understanding about how your individual money scripts need to change if you’re going to share a future. Raising financial matters with your partner isn’t just about discussing debt. You also need to set shared financial goals, discuss career and income changes, and adjust budgets to suit your needs.

Since financial plans change over a lifetime, expect that the discussion will always continue. Pace yourself. If some topics are heavier than others, give it time and patience before revisiting intractable issues with the help of experts. Whether you combine finances or keep them separate, neither partner should be kept in the dark. Financial transparency is a pillar of a successful relationship.

However, with the right ground rules, you can use these discussions to gain valuable perspective and advice.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-friends-8608029,"Money is a deeply personal topic. But by keeping our finances under wraps from friends, we may be missing out on valuable advice, deeper relationships, and new perspectives.

“Having a friend or a group of friends that you can talk to about money can radically shift your relationship with it,” says Grant Sabatier, author of Financial Freedom and creator of Millennial Money. “The more you think about money and talk about money, the more comfortable that you get with it.”

Here are some helpful tips on how to start the conversation, set boundaries, and help one another toward financial independence.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Discussing money with friends can help you build stronger relationships and foster financial well-being.
Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is crucial for open and honest money conversations.
Starting the conversation with interesting and indirect questions can help break the ice and encourage participation.
Setting boundaries and expectations can prevent conflicts and ensure productive discussions.
Seeking educational resources and working with financial advisors and financial therapists can enhance your financial journey.
How to Start the Conversation

Before deciding what you want to talk about, you will want to determine who you want to talk with.

Casually incorporating personal finance topics into your conversations with friends can help you figure out which friends share your financial values and what tone you want the conversation to have. Here are some questions to open the conversation without getting into the nitty-gritty:

Are you more of a spender or a saver?
What’s more worth it: an experience or an item?
Can money buy happiness?

For me and many of my college-aged friends, investing in a Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), opening a high-yield savings account, or amassing a strong credit score are points of pride. As Sabatier suggests, speaking with friends in similar financial situations to your own helps you relate to one another without a sense of competition.

“Talking with people who were in the exact same situation as me about money was very, very effective,” Sabatier says. “It’s being on a life journey with someone else who’s where you’re at.”

How to Create a Judgment-Free Environment

Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is key to having constructive conversations and building relationships with your friends. Here are some tips for setting the tone and building trust.

Set Ground Rules 

Before you jump into a conversation, some financial experts advise setting ground rules and objectives.1 Here are some sample rules that I have used with my friends:

Keep the conversation confidential
Speak using “I” statements
Actively listen without interrupting
Do not pass judgment
Avoid comparisons

This step may feel overly formal, but it can help define the conversation’s terms and avoid later discomfort.

Lead by Example

Sabatier says that by embodying the tone that you want the conversation to take, your friends will be able to pick up on your language and demeanor to support a constructive conversation.

Especially if you’re initiating the conversation, you may need to demonstrate to your friends that an easy and comfortable money chat is achievable in the first place. Imagine if one of your friends approached you to discuss personal finance, and they immediately began passing judgments on your expenses, insisting that you use the same budget tracker that they do, or complaining about their own financial situation (which you know is more stable than your own). That would be horrible!

Modeling practices can help you avoid these situations and lay a foundation for success.

Adopt a Growth Mindset

You have a whole financial future ahead of you, and nothing is set in stone. Your financial situation will likely ebb and flow throughout your life, and centering growth and positivity in conversations with friends can improve your mindset and help you cultivate stronger financial relationships with your friends.

According to Kristin Wong, author of Get Money, a financial freedom guide for young people, confiding in friends about financial situations can be very helpful and reassuring.

“It can be really hard not to internalize our money challenges and see them as personal shortcomings,” Wong says. “Talking about those issues openly with a friend can make you feel a little less alone. Most of us have been there, and there’s a good chance your friends have, too.”

Set Boundaries and Expectations

The greatest risk when discussing money with friends is that the conversation becomes uncomfortable, and it jeopardizes your friendship. According to Sabatier and Wong, setting expectations and boundaries for money conversations can stop this problem at the root.

Personally, my precise account balances are off-limits to friends. Some of my friends are uncomfortable speaking about their financial support from their parents, and other friends choose not to talk about their college financial aid packages.

We each have different preferences, and being upfront about them can benefit your relationships in the long run.

“You can still have a candid conversation about money without sharing the nitty-gritty details of your financial life,” Wong says. “If you’re talking to the right person, you should feel comfortable setting boundaries on specific details, like your income or debt amounts, to maintain privacy and prevent any potential discomfort.”

If you do run into issues with navigating sensitive topics, it’s best to tackle any miscommunication or discomfort head-on. Some conflicts may represent a flaw in your approach to financial conversations with friends, and they could be signs to reevaluate boundaries or limits on advice.

Set Financial Goals Together

Setting financial goals with your friends can keep you motivated and improve your financial literacy. According to Wong, by sharing financial successes and failures, you can better evaluate your financial strategies.

“Friends in the same age group often face similar financial challenges: student loans, entry-level salaries, budget constraints, and so on,” Wong says. “Most young adults have a shared understanding of what it is to struggle financially, so you can create a community that fosters financial literacy and cheers each other on when it comes to financial goals.”

Address Differences in Financial Situations

When you’re in college, you and your friends all live in the same dorms and eat the same dining hall food, but when you’re in the real world, financial disparities between you and your friends will probably become more obvious—especially as you embark on different career paths.

It’s certainly not impossible to navigate money conversations with friends in different financial situations, especially if you share the same values. However, you should address financial differences head-on and approach these conversations intentionally, to prevent feelings of pity or resentment.

“You really have to come to it from a place of love, and respect, and understanding. Try to put yourself in the person’s shoes that you’re talking with, and recognize how you talk about money will make them feel,” Sabatier says. “If you have more money than them, often talking with someone who doesn’t have as much money can come off as bragging or make them feel bad because they’re not in this similar position.”

Seek Professional Help If Needed

While speaking about money with friends can be very helpful, these relationships have their limits, and you may want or need additional support from a financial advisor or educational source.

“You can get valuable insight from friends while also seeking help from a professional,” Wong says. “It’s like going to a therapist, right? A good therapist is going to help you process whatever you’re going through, but your friends can be there for you, too.”

Here are some helpful resources for finding a financial planner:

National Association of Personal Financial Advisors
CFP Board
XY Planning Network

Of course, hiring a financial advisor may not be financially realistic for many young people. According to Wong, older friends or colleagues can be helpful resources. You can also look into robo-advisor programs, which can help you manage your money for much less than a traditional financial advisor.

As Sabatier notes, a financial advisor can be very helpful, but you should always try to do your own research before seeking out a professional.

“​​Unfortunately, the financial industry is so predatory, and it’s really built around exploiting people and exploiting what they don’t know,” Sabatier says. “So if you know a little bit, you’re not gonna get scammed or the likelihood is gonna be a lot less, and you’re gonna be able to ask better questions for yourself.”

How Do You Start a Conversation Asking for Money?

Asking for money can be hard and often embarrassing. If you want to ask a friend or family member, it is important to approach the matter seriously, being direct and honest. You should explain why you need the money, provide a clear timeline for repayment, and thank the person for hearing you out.

Still, some experts in financial planning for young adults warn against lending or borrowing from friends and family.

“I think it’s probably best to avoid co-signing or lending money to friends because it has the potential to ruin friendships, and our friendships are more important than money,” Wong says.

Can a Friend or Family Member Help Me with Bill Paying and Banking?

You can ask a friend or family member to help you with bill paying and banking, but you should know that this move could come with uncomfortable consequences or power imbalances in your personal relationships.

If you have already decided that you want to ask a friend or family member for help with bill paying and banking, you have both formal and informal options.

Informal loans could involve your close friend cutting you a check with an informal agreement that you will pay the money back in a set amount of time.

More formal options could include a convenience account that allows you to designate a person to help you with depositing, withdrawing, and writing checks. Alternatively, adding a friend or family member to your account as a trusted contact would notify that person if your bank suspects a financial scam, and granting a person close to you power of attorney would give them the ability to act on your behalf regarding your finances.2


Who Is the Best Person to Talk to About Finances?

While there is no “best” person to talk to about finances, some financial experts say that you may find it helpful to consult your friends and family about personal finance questions. Given that these people are deeply familiar with your values and character, they may be able to provide you with more candid and personalized advice than a financial advisor or therapist.

Regardless of who you talk to about your personal finances, you should make an effort to educate yourself on different financial products and services before entering into a conversation. Resources like Investopedia’s Financial Literacy Resource Center, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Endowment for Financial Education provide foundational finance knowledge, so you can know your options and control your money.

The Bottom Line

Friends can be a great resource for personal finance matters. However, it’s essential to recognize the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations when engaging in financial discussions with friends. By openly communicating personal preferences and boundaries, you can foster healthier relationships and avoid potential discomfort or misunderstandings.

Beyond friends, you may want to seek professional guidance from financial advisors and external financial education resources. Ultimately, by navigating financial discussions with friends sensitively, you can strengthen your friendships while enhancing your financial well-being."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,4 Easy Budgeting Techniques,"To create and stick to a budget, it’s helpful to have some tricks up your sleeve. Here are some easy tactics to keep you on track.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112116/four-easy-budgeting-techniques-you-should-master.asp,"For some people, budgeting money comes naturally; they like being organized and tracking data. For others, it’s a bit more challenging. Facts and figures aren’t their forte and constant monitoring is tedious. Even if you fall into the latter category, the process can be made easier with a few quick tricks.

Here are four easy techniques that will make budget planning a breeze.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Dump the receipts. Use an app to track your expenses.
Automate your bill-paying and monthly savings.
Be flexible, but if you constantly bust your budget revise it.
1. Automate Your Tracking

There's no real reason these days to save your receipts in a pile and wade through them later. There are apps for that.

A smartphone app or software program can help you track your budget. These programs often use the same security systems that online banks do, so if you choose a reputable tracker, you should not be concerned with the safety of your information.

The programs will not only track your spending but will help you categorize your purchases, send you alerts when you are nearing your budget limits, and help you set long-term financial goals and keep to them.

2. Automate Your Spending

Automatic bill payment and automatic transfers of money into a checking account can take some of the difficulty out of sticking to a budget.

After all, if you never see the money in your checking account you won’t spend it on things that are not in your budget. Just be sure to keep enough funds in the account to cover your automated expenses so that you aren’t hit with overdraft fees. 

Coordinate Deposits and Withdrawals

One way to avoid this risk is to set all automatic withdrawals to hit at the same time that your paycheck is deposited so that your money goes directly toward the bills and your savings goals at a time that you know you will have sufficient funds in your account.

Some employers will even direct deposit a designated amount into a savings account each pay period while putting the balance into your checking account.

3. Be Flexible

Your budget has to be flexible enough to absorb some of life's nasty little surprises. Inevitably, unforeseen expenses will come up and bust your budget.

It's important to recognize that a budget is a tool that can be adjusted if it isn’t aligning with your spending.

If you go over budget a few times, don’t beat yourself up. Instead, plan for a slightly larger emergency fund as a cushion. If you continually go over, it’s time to reassess your spending. You're paying out more than you can afford and you need to make some adjustments.

4. Consider Your Future

Most people understand the difference between wants and needs when it comes to budgeting. However, many people incorrectly place savings in the optional spending category.

The Bottom Line

Planning for your retirement, building an emergency fund, and saving for long-term goals are all critical for your financial health. They should not be considered optional expenses that can be eliminated when they're inconvenient.

Even if it means forgoing dinner out or cutting the cable bill, saving money needs to be a mandatory part of your budget. You want to be financially prepared to meet your long-term goals, whether you want to buy a house, travel the world, or pay off debts."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,How to Start a Family and Save for Retirement,"To start a family and save for retirement, you’ll need to plan ahead and take advantage of cost reduction strategies, tax benefits, and budgeting techniques.",https://www.investopedia.com/family-and-retirement-8599280,"Starting a family while saving for retirement comes with challenges and benefits. In most cases, time is on your side.

If you start early, you still have plenty of time to grow your retirement savings and benefit from compound interest. And there are a number of tax-advantaged plans out there to help you do so without incurring a huge tax bill.

On the other hand, starting relatively young means you may still be building your career and income. According to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2023” report, the average retirement savings account balance for ages 35–44 is $76,354. For ages 25–34, that number is just $30,017. On top of that, there’s buying a home, a car, and paying for your children’s college and weddings to account for.

The good news is that with the right tools and strategies, planning for both your family’s needs and your retirement is entirely possible.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Plan ahead and start saving early to balance starting a family with building a successful retirement plan.
Understand common costs for individuals and couples who want to raise children while saving for retirement.
Assess your financial situation, set goals as a family, and create a budget to meet those goals.
Take advantage of cost reduction strategies and tax benefits available to families.
Use tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for retirement.
Costs to Consider

In general, the stereotypical American Dream is becoming more expensive. Take the average cost of raising two children until age 18, estimated at $576,896. The average amount needed to retire is even higher, clocking in at $715,968, according to Investopedia’s recent analysis.

Understanding the various costs you may face is the first step to preparing for them. Couples or individuals who are starting a family should consider the following.

Having a Baby or Adopting

If you’re enrolled in a large group plan, out-of-pocket costs for a hospital birth average $2,854 per child. When it comes to adoption, costs vary widely depending on whether you adopt via the public child welfare system, a private agency, independent adoption, or intercountry adoption.

According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adoption from a private agency may cost $30,000 to $60,000.

Independent or intercountry adoption ranges from $20,000 to $50,000, whereas adopting a child from the welfare system is virtually free. The associated expenses may include home study, court and legal fees, and social work or counseling services.

Paying for Child Care

Child care has long been a substantial expense for families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deems child care as “affordable” when it costs no more than 7% of a family’s household income. Yet many families spend 10% to 24% of household income on child care.

Child care costs vary by state. For example, the average cost of infant care in Alabama is around $500 per month and $432 each month for a 4-year-old. In California, the average monthly cost of infant care is $1,412, and $956 for a 4-year-old. And in Michigan, you’d pay an average of $905 per month for infant care or $741 per month for a 4-year-old.

Saving for Higher Education

Putting your kids through college is a major cost, no matter how you slice it. For academic year 2021–22, the average total cost for full-time undergraduate attendance was $32,900 at a private for-profit institution and $55,800 at a private nonprofit institution. Meanwhile, public institutions had an average total cost of $26,000.

These amounts represent the sum of tuition and required fees, books, supplies, and the average cost of room and board for students living on campus at four-year institutions.

Keep in mind that this amount doesn’t reflect the various types of financial aid that students may receive.

Assess Your Financial Situation

Evaluating your current financial situation is a crucial step toward reaching your personal financial goals. A thorough assessment of your income, expenses, and savings potential will provide valuable insights into your overall financial health and areas for improvement.

Here are key aspects to consider when assessing your finances:

Income

Calculate your gross annual income by adding up all sources of earnings, such as wages, salaries, self-employment profits, interest, dividends, and rental income. Be sure to account for any changes in employment status, promotions, or new job opportunities throughout the year.

Expenses

Create a detailed list of all ongoing and ad hoc expenses, categorizing them accordingly. Common categories include housing, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, healthcare, debt payments, entertainment, subscriptions, and miscellaneous expenses.

To get a clear picture of your spending habits, track your expenses over several months by using budgeting tools like spreadsheets, mobile apps, or online resources provided by banks and credit unions.

Savings Potential

Determine your disposable income by calculating the amount left from your income after paying taxes and necessary expenses. Then, evaluate whether you have enough funds available for emergency savings, retirement planning, investments, and discretionary spending.

Establish Family Priorities

With an understanding of the costs involved and a clear picture of your financial situation, you can begin to prioritize and outline future goals—both for your family and your retirement. Specific goals will depend on you, your partner, and your financial situation. But the following are a good place to start:

Start or Grow Your Emergency Fund 

If an unexpected car repair, pet expense, or medical emergency suddenly popped up, would you have enough cash to cover it? What if you got laid off next month?

If you aren’t prepared, an unexpected expense could derail your savings plans. That's why financial experts always recommend having an emergency fund to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses. If you’re self-employed or your income is unpredictable, you’ll want to save even more.

Having a safety net set aside keeps you from having to use credit cards or dipping into your retirement savings. The best place for an emergency fund is a liquid and thus easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings or other interest-earning account.


Put Retirement First

When setting financial goals, it’s natural for parents to want to put their children first. But financial planners recommend prioritizing your own retirement over saving for a child’s education.

While students have access to loans, grants, and scholarships, there are no such resources for parents. Saving for retirement falls largely on the individual—with some help from your employer if you’re lucky.

So, contribute as much as you can to your retirement savings accounts, and take advantage of any 401(k) or Health Savings Account (HSA) matching programs that your company offers.

Plan Ahead for Education Savings 

Once you hit your retirement savings goals, the next step is saving for your kids’ college tuition. A 529 plan is a great way to do this, since it’s specifically designed to help pay for higher education.

This tax-advantaged account allows contributions to grow federal income tax-deferred, with tax-free withdrawals for qualified higher education expenses (such as tuition and room and board).

Establish Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Goals for Your Family 

For families who may feel overwhelmed by competing financial goals—like buying a home, saving for a child's education, or retirement—Mike Kojonen, founder of Principal Preservation Services, recommends setting goal milestones.

“For example, rather than seeing retirement as a distant, abstract aim, break it down into actionable steps like increasing retirement contributions annually or setting up a dedicated college savings fund for their children,” he says.

These targets can be broken down into specific short-, medium-, and long-term financial objectives for your family. For instance, building an emergency fund, contributing to employer-matched retirement plans, and establishing a consistent saving habit might serve as short-term goals.

Long-term goals often include caring for aging parents or, if your children are young, saving for their college education. Medium-term goals (say, five years) could include a family vacation, buying a new car, or remodeling your home.

Consider having a conversation with family members or a financial advisor to help outline these priorities and get on the same page.

Mark Damsgaard, head of client advisory at Global Residence Index, also recommends that couples discuss whether they’ll keep some assets separate or share all assets.

“It’s not wrong to not share the entirety of your assets, especially if you worked hard for them on your own. And then you may talk about having joint accounts for the earnings and assets you acquire when you enter your marriage or partnership,” Damsgaard says.


Revisit Your Budget

Achieving financial goals is often easier when you have a budget to give structure and clarity to your spending habits. A budget works best when it’s based on the specifics of your situation.

Use what you’ve learned about known costs for major goals like family and retirement, your financial situation, and your long- and short-term goals to set a realistic budget. Compare the following common budgeting models to see what works best for you.

50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% of income to needs (such as housing, food, and utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, and hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment (including retirement savings). While it may not work for everyone, this rule is popular because of its simplicity.

Progressive Budgeting

With progressive budgeting, you gradually increase savings and retirement contributions as your income grows or your family’s financial situation improves. Progressive budgeting is particularly useful in working against lifestyle creep, a common phenomenon that can eat into your retirement and family savings if you aren’t careful.

Pay Yourself First

Pay yourself first is exactly what it sounds like. You set aside money from your income for debt payments and savings, including retirement contributions, before taking care of other bills.

Of course, you still need to account for rent and other ongoing expenses. But this method, sometimes called reverse budgeting, makes it easy to prioritize savings goals. For example, you could set up automatic transfers or contributions to retirement accounts before allocating money for other uses.


Tips for Balancing Saving for a Family and Retirement

Reducing costs and maximizing tax benefits mean more money that you can put toward retirement or family goals.

See Where You Can Reduce Costs 

Lowering your child care bill can amount to major savings. Consider enlisting help from neighbors and family members or arranging child care swaps with other parents. Some states also offer government-funded assistance programs to help families pay for child care.

Government resources include Head Start and Early Head Start programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, military child care financial assistance programs, and government vouchers or subsidies. You should also see if your employer offers a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA).

To save money beyond child care costs, look into other possibilities like:

Mortgage refinancing to reduce your monthly payment
Adjusting your thermostat or using energy-efficient bulbs to save on utility bills
Carpooling, using public transportation, or walking/cycling to trim transportation costs
Cutting food costs by cooking at home, buying store brands, and planning meals ahead of time

Maximize Tax Benefits 

There are tax benefits designed to help families save money, including:

Child Tax Credit (CTC): The CTC provides a tax credit of up to $2,000 per qualifying child under the age of 17. For 2024, up to $1,700 of the tax credit may be refundable, depending on your tax situation.
Child and Dependent Care Credit: This credit covers expenses for child care services, such as babysitting, daycare, or preschool, for children under age 13 or disabled spouses or parents. The credit ranges from 20% to 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents.
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Low- and moderate-income working families can benefit from the EITC, which reduces the amount of tax owed and may result in a tax refund. The credit is based on a percentage of earned income, with higher income phaseouts for taxpayers with children.
Credit for Other Dependents: This is available to taxpayers with a dependent who doesn’t qualify for the Child Tax Credit, such as children age 17 or older, qualifying relatives, or dependent parents.
Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction: This permits self-employed parents to deduct 100% of the cost of health insurance premiums paid for family members, including children under age 27.

Take Advantage of Retirement Savings Options

Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts to maximize savings and growth.

401(k) Plans: Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary toward retirement savings, often with employer matching contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Traditional IRAs are personal retirement accounts that provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA: SEP and SIMPLE IRAs let small business owners and self-employed individuals save for retirement while receiving tax benefits.
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): For families or individuals with a high-deductible health plan, HSAs offer flexible options for saving money on healthcare or boosting retirement savings.

How Much Should I Save Monthly for Retirement?

The amount you should save monthly for retirement will vary based on your income, age, and retirement goals. Financial experts recommend saving at least 10% to 15% of your income for retirement—including your employer match, if you have one. If possible, bumping that up to 20% of your income can help you save significantly more over time. This is especially helpful if you’ve started later on saving for retirement.

What Are the Best Retirement Savings Options for Families?

You can use a number of strategies to help you save for retirement, including tax-advantaged retirement accounts like traditional or Roth 401(k)s and IRAs, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs (if you’re self-employed), HSAs, or other investment accounts. For parents who want to start putting money away for their children, custodial IRAs offer tax-advantaged savings.

The best retirement plan to build your nest egg will depend on your financial situation, your goals for retirement, and other factors. Understand the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, and tax rules surrounding accounts to help you make the best decision. You may want to consult a financial advisor.


What Is the 5% Rule for Retirement Savings?

The 5% rule is a frequently used rule of thumb for calculating how much you can withdraw from retirement savings each year without running out of money. A modified version of the traditional 4% rule, the 5% rule allows for a higher annual withdrawal rate, which may work for long-term investors with diversified portfolios. Work with a financial advisor to assess whether the 5% withdrawal rate aligns with your retirement objectives, investment strategy, and overall financial plan.

The Bottom Line

Armed with knowledge about your goals, potential costs, financial situation, and available tools for investing, you can achieve a comfortable retirement while also growing a family. Start early and contribute consistently to retirement savings in order to maximize your savings and growth potential. If needed, seek professional financial advice to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning and evaluate the best decisions based on your specific situation."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,Budgeting Calculator,This free budgeting calculator shows how to divide your income between savings and spending.,https://www.investopedia.com/budgeting-calculator-5101411,"A Monthly Budgeting Calculator to Help Take Control of Your Finances

Are you struggling to keep your spending below your income? Do you strategize about how to increase your savings? Our free budgeting calculator will help you save time and avoid mistakes when you need to understand where your money is going every month.

How the Budgeting Calculator Works 

To use our free budgeting calculator, just enter your monthly income and expenses. We’ll show you what percentage of your income you’re spending (or saving) in each category and whether you’re living within or beyond your means.

The output from using the budgeting calculator shows the percentage of your income that goes toward each category. Seeing the results in pie-chart form makes it easy to tell where most of your money goes. It breaks down your total monthly income and total monthly expenses while displaying the percentages of your income that are spent in specific areas. And it shows the total monthly funds that remain after you've accounted for all those expenses. The bigger the gap, the more extra funds you may have.

Key Components of a Budget Calculation

The categories below offer a basic framework that you can use to organize your expenses and think about the amounts that might be reasonable for you in each category. Everyone’s finances are different, and this calculator is a tool to help you, so use it in the way that makes the most sense for how you think about your money. You don’t have to allocate your expenses exactly as we describe.

Start by filling in the budgeting calculator with your real expenses. If some are uneven (you buy more clothes some months than others), calculate an annual average. Take a screenshot of the results. Then see how you can improve your remaining monthly funds by adjusting expenses that are discretionary—what budget experts call ""wants."" Where are your savings opportunities?

Total Monthly Income

Make sure to use your after-tax income for the whole family here—your budget is about the money you have available to spend. This should include your income from wages and salaries, gig work or part-time jobs, bonuses, child support, alimony, tips, Social Security, distributions, settlements, and any other sources of income.

Housing

Four walls, a floor, and a roof comprise most people’s biggest expense. A common rule of thumb is to limit housing costs to 30% of your income. For many households this is a challenge: Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies considers a household “moderately cost-burdened” when housing costs 31% to 49% of income, and “severely cost-burdened” when housing takes up 50% or more of income. In 2021, about 23% of U.S. households were cost burdened.1 Include your rent or mortgage payment in this category as well as renter’s insurance or homeowners insurance. Homeowners will also include any maintenance fees in this category.

Electricity, natural gas, water service, trash pickup, and the like are added together and go into this category. It can be hard to make a dent in these monthly bills without significant changes to your energy use, and some of those changes require upfront investments that take a long time to pay off, such as energy-efficient light bulbs, appliances, and heating and cooling systems. Caulking and weather stripping to seal gaps around doors and windows is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to achieve savings here, even if you’re not handy and on a tight budget.

Line items like property taxes or homeowners association fees can fill in the other area, including any other housing-related costs that need to be counted.

Food

In this category, add your essential groceries for the whole family. Add in any prepared meal kits and restaurant meals. Don't forget to account for takeout deliveries.

Transportation

The average household spent $12,295 on transportation in 2022 (the most recently available data), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average income before taxes was $94,003, meaning the average person’s transportation spending takes up 11.6% of their income.2 In this category, you’ll include costs such as public transit, car payments, auto insurance, parking, tolls, and gasoline or fuel. If you use taxis and ride-sharing services, be sure to add those into the line item for other/miscellaneous expenses, along with any additional transportation expenses.

Education

Many people have no education expenses. Others are funding their children’s (or grandchildren’s) education or paying back student loans. There’s no rule of thumb for the percentage of your budget that should go toward schooling. Good options for keeping these costs down include creating a 529 savings plan and refinancing private student loans.

Personal and Family

If you have dependents, include expenses here that you haven’t already included in other categories. These might be costs for cellphone bills, clothes and shoes, household supplies, and vacation planning funds. Do you spend money on entertainment? Account for streaming services, museum and fitness memberships, and tickets to events in this section. Personal care (haircuts, toiletries, manicures) and pet care (vet visits, pet food, pet insurance) can also go in this category.

Debt payments outside of mortgages and student loans should go in this section. This involves adding together credit cards and personal loan payments. Add in costs such as child care, adult day care, tutoring and lessons, and charitable donations into the ""other"" section.

Healthcare

Medical, dental, and vision care insurance premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance or copays should go in this category, along with any medications (prescription and over-the-counter ones) and medical devices you use. Your premiums will be the same every month, but the other expenses can fluctuate depending on whether you get sick, need a health screening, require new glasses, or something else. Use past spending or make your best guess at your annual cost in this category, then divide by 12.

Savings and Investments

If your income allows for it, a good rule of thumb is to allocate 20% of your income to savings and investments. In addition to keeping cash in the bank for emergencies, you should funnel money into a tax-advantaged retirement account for investments. If you’ve covered those bases, you might allocate extra money to a college savings account, save for a down payment on a home, or funnel money to a taxable brokerage account in which you hold tax-free or low-tax investments, such as municipal bonds and Treasury securities. You can use the ""other"" section for any additional savings goals you might have.

Budgeting Techniques and Philosophies

Here are some helpful methods for creating a personal spending plan. Would one of these work for you?

50/30/20 Method

This method says you should aim to spend roughly 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and investments. If you live with your parents or have a paid-off mortgage, you might spend less on needs and more on wants and savings. If your housing takes up 50% of your income, you’ll have to spend less on wants and possible savings. You can adjust the percentages to suit your situation; the idea is to take a big-picture approach to your spending instead of nitpicking every category.

80/20 Method

For this method, you save and invest 20% of your income, then spend the other 80% however you want. It’s an even simpler method than the 50/30/20 method. It can work well for people who don’t have the time or desire to account for their expenses in detail. You can change the numbers to achieve your own savings goals. People who want to achieve financial independence and retire early—or those who are trying to catch up on retirement savings later in life—might use a 70/30, 60/40, or 50/50 split.

Zero-based Budgeting

A zero-based budget assigns a purpose to every last dollar of your income. When you subtract your savings and expenses from your income, the result will be zero. It’s helpful for people who prefer something more detailed than the 50/30/20 or 80/20 methods. If your income and expenses are complicated (for example, you have multiple, variable sources of income and more than 100 expenses per month), this method may be too time-consuming for you.

The Envelope System

If you use this budgeting system, you’ll allocate a specific amount of money to each budget category at the beginning of the month. When you’ve spent what you’ve allocated to a category, you’re done for the month, unless you can move money out of another category. For example, if your electric bill is $100 and you only put $80 in your literal or figurative electricity envelope, you’ll have to take $20 out of the grocery envelope (or some other envelope). 

The envelope system is a good method for people who are on a tight budget or trying to stop overspending. It originated with the idea of literally putting cash in envelopes, but you can keep your cash safely in the bank and use software or a pencil and paper instead.

It's easy to get off track if you don't follow a budget when you make one. Tech tools for budgeting can help make tracking a budget easier—even fun. Find a budgeting app or budgeting software that you find easy and helpful to use.

Benefits of Using a Budget

Budgeting adds one more thing to your to-do list, and who has time for that? You should, because the extra time and effort it takes to make a budget are worth it. For the skeptics, here are four main benefits of budgeting.

Benefit 1: Maximize your returns from working—You probably spend 20 to 50 hours a week earning money. If you’re not spending and saving consciously and carefully, you’re not getting the maximum benefit from the time you spend working. That means you’re probably going to spend even more time working and less time enjoying friends, family, hobbies, and sleep.
Benefit 2: Gain a sense of control—It’s easy to feel like expenses are happening to you, especially if money is tight. Planning your budget at the beginning of every month can make you feel like you’re choosing where your money goes. It can also help you see where you might be able to make room for saving more or paying down debt faster so that unexpected costs become less likely to set you way back.
Benefit 3: Achieve your goals—You might have a goal of traveling to Tokyo, buying a car, or becoming a one-income household instead of a two-income household. Whatever motivates you, budgeting can help you get there by helping you set financial goals and prioritize where your money is going.
Benefit 4: Spot problems before they catch you off guard—When you create a budget, you’ll be able to see clearly that only having $30 left at the end of the month to put toward your credit card bill puts you at serious risk of being unable to get out of debt or lack the money you'll need to help put your kid through school. You might not be able to solve the problem immediately, but you could start taking steps in the right direction, whether it’s learning how to improve your credit score so you can refinance your debt at a lower interest rate or researching options for a less expensive education."
snowball method debt repayment success rate,investopedia,"Debt Avalanche: Meaning, Pros and Cons, and Example",A debt avalanche is an accelerated system of paying down debt that is based on paying the loan with the highest interest rate first. Learn how to use the debt avalanche.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp,"What Is a Debt Avalanche?

A debt avalanche is a type of accelerated debt repayment plan. Essentially, a debtor allocates enough money to make the minimum payment on each source of debt, then devotes any remaining repayment funds to the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the debt avalanche approach, once the debt with the highest interest rate is entirely paid off, then the extra repayment funds go toward the next highest interest-bearing loan. This process continues until all the debts are paid off.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The debt avalanche is a systematic way of paying down debt to save money on interest.
Individuals who use the debt avalanche strategy make the minimum payment on each debt, then use any remaining available funds to pay the debt with the highest interest rates.
A debt avalanche is different from a debt snowball, which is when a borrower pays down the smallest debt first.
How Debt Avalanches Work

Paying off your debts can be a daunting task, especially when you're faced with multiple debts, high balances, and sky-high interest rates. Making only the minimum monthly payments each month can make the process seem even more overwhelming, as the majority of your payments go toward interest rather than the principal balance.

This is why it's important to have a strategy in place that will help you become debt-free. Using the debt avalanche strategy is just one possibility. This tactic allows you to concentrate on the debts with the highest rates first. You can then target the one with the second-highest rate until you're left with the one that charges the lowest rate.

The debt avalanche allows you to focus on lowering the debt you have by paying less interest over time. Here's how you should structure the strategy:

The first step in starting a debt avalanche strategy is to make a list of all the debts you owe along with the individual interest rate for each.
Next, designate an amount of your available monthly income to pay debts. This amount should come from any funds not currently obligated for living and household expenses like rent, grocery, daycare, or transportation. 
Make a lump-sum payment (above the minimum required payment) to the debt with the highest interest rate. Ensure that the payment is significant but within your means.
Continue making minimum payments on your other obligations until the highest debt is paid off.
Move on to the debt with the next highest interest rate until all your debts are clear.

This strategy takes time, so it's important to be patient and not lose your focus.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

There are benefits and drawbacks that you must weigh out before you begin tackling your debts using this strategy. We've highlighted some of the key pros and cons of using a debt avalanche strategy to pay off your debts below.

Advantages of Debt Avalanches

The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it reduces the total interest you pay in the long term. Interest adds to your debts because most lenders use compound interest. The accrual rate depends on the frequency of compounding—the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest.

A debt avalanche repayment strategy also reduces the amount of time it will take you to get out of debt—assuming you make consistent payments—because less interest accumulates.


If you find yourself overburdened with debt, consider speaking to a financial professional or an organization that specializes in debt relief. Investopedia has a list of debt relief companies that may be able to help you out.

Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

One of the main disadvantages of using the debt avalanche as a repayment strategy is that it only targets interest rates rather than balances. As such, you may not necessarily put a dent in the debt with the highest balance as it only receives the minimum payment. This can be daunting and cause you to feel like you're not making any progress.

The debt avalanche method requires discipline for consistency, which can be a downside for some people. Even with the best intentions of sticking with the debt-avalanche system, you may revert to making minimum payments on all the debts, especially if your financial situation changes. That’s why most financial planners recommend to first save up a six-month emergency fund before attempting any accelerated debt payoff plan.


Pros

Reduces total interest paid

Less time spent getting out of debt

Cons

Targets interest rates rather than (high) balances

Requires discipline and consistency

Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

The debt avalanche is different from the debt snowball. This is another accelerated debt payoff plan that requires a focused, dedicated approach.

With the debt snowball strategy, the debtor uses money beyond the minimum payments to pay off debts with the lowest balance first before moving on to the one(s) with the largest outstanding balance.

This means that you'll pay more than the minimum payment on the debt with the lowest balance until it's paid in full. You'll then move on to the next smallest debt until you eventually reach the one with the highest balance. As with the debt avalanche, you must continue making the minimum payments on the other debts as you paid down the smallest one in the bunch.

Although the debt snowball method doesn't save as much as the debt avalanche in terms of total interest charges, it can be a better strategy for staying motivated by eliminating small debts more quickly.

Most credit card balances compound interest daily, but there are loans where the interest can compound monthly, semiannually, or annually.

Example of a Debt Avalanche

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a debt avalanche works. Let's imagine you have $500 available every month (after you factor in your living expenses) to put toward paying down your debt. Say your current loans include:

$1,000 on a credit card with a 26% annual percentage rate (APR)
$1,250 on a personal loan with a 12% APR
$5,000 line of credit (LOC) with an 8% interest rate

For simplicity’s sake, assume each debt has a minimum monthly payment of $50. You would need to allot $150 toward paying each loan's minimum monthly payment ($50 x 3). The remaining $350 would also be put toward your credit card, the highest-interest debt. After the credit card balance is cleared, you would put the extra money toward the personal loan until it's paid off. Finally, you would put all $500 toward your line of credit, which has the smallest interest rate.

What Is the Difference Between the Debt Avalanche and the Debt Snowball?

The debt avalanche method involves paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. With the debt snowball method, you focus on putting your extra money toward your smallest debt first. The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it saves more in interest in the long term, while the benefit of the debt snowball method is that it can be more motivating.

What Is the Disadvantage of Debt Avalanche?

The major disadvantage of the debt avalanche method can be seen in cases where your highest-interest debt is also your largest debt. If you start putting your extra money toward paying down this debt first, you may save money on interest, but you may not feel like you're making strides toward paying down the loan.

What Is an Example of Debt Avalanche?

For this example of a debt avalanche, say you have three credit cards and are carrying balances on each. The first credit card has a $600 balance with an APR of 24%, the second has a $1,000 balance with an APR of 26%, and the third has a $1,200 balance with an APR of 19%. Using this method, you would first pay down the second credit card because it has the highest interest rate.

The Bottom Line

Whether the debt avalanche or the debt snowball method is the best strategy for paying off debt will depend on your financial situation. Using the debt avalanche method will save you the most money in interest in the long term, but some people find more success with the debt snowball method, which can be more motivating because you'll pay off smaller debts sooner.

Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt. We’ll go over the costs for five popular debt relief options: debt settlement, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt payoff apps, and bankruptcy.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Debt settlement companies: Often 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Many services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and—for balance transfer credit cards—balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, although there is much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1

Investopedia / Zoe Hansen

The term “debt relief” often refers to debt settlement companies, but it’s also used as an umbrella term to describe just about anything meant to help ease the financial strain from debt. Many types of loans have specific debt relief options, such as recasting a mortgage or the different income-driven payment plans available for federal student loans. When it comes to anything other than simple unsecured debt (like personal loans and credit cards), it’s best to research the specific debt and contact your lender for assistance. 

Costs of Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?2

Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.

Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.

Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:

Settlement fees: These fees range from 14% to 30% of your debt, but they’re only paid on debts that the company successfully negotiates. Some debt settlement companies base this fee on the amount of settled debt, while others base it on the amount of enrolled debt (again, only concerning accounts that are settled; if the company can’t negotiate one of your debts, you wouldn’t pay fees for that debt).
Monthly account fees: You may be charged a setup and/or monthly fee for the third-party savings account that debt settlement companies require you to use to build up your lump sum payment.

More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:

Income taxes: You’ll generally be required to pay taxes on the amount of debt your creditors forgive when you file your taxes at the end of the year.3 Depending on your tax bracket, that could amount to 10% to 37% (in 2024) of the amount that your creditors forgave.4
Credit damage: Creditors will report late payments, defaults, collections, and debt settlements on your credit reports, which can cause serious damage to your credit. A closed, delinquent account will generally stay on your credit reports for seven years.5
Late payment fees: Creditors will charge late payment fees, which can cause the amount you owe to increase while you’re not making payments on your debt. These fees add to your balance and can be included in settlements, but if the debt settlement company isn’t successful, you’ll owe all those extra fees, too.
Unsuccessful debt settlement: Although old, one 2007 Federal Trade Commission analysis found that only about half of people successfully completed a debt relief and settlement program.6 People who don’t complete the program can end up with worse credit and in more debt than they started with.

If you’re considering debt settlement, it’s important to work with a trustworthy company that doesn’t charge extra-high fees. See the best debt relief companies to explore our top picks.

Costs of Credit Counseling

Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.

Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.7

Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.8 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:

Debt management plan setup fee: $0 to $99
Debt management plan monthly fee: $0 to $75

You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.

Costs of Debt Consolidation/Refinance

Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.

Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.

If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.

Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:

Loan interest: Loans charge interest from the start, albeit at a lower overall rate on average than credit cards (unless you get a 0% APR credit card).9
Origination fees: Loans often come with origination fees ranging from 1% to 6% or more, especially if you don’t have good or excellent credit.

And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:

Annual fees: Balance transfer cards may come with annual fees, which are sometimes waived in the first year. The best cards don’t charge such a fee, however.
Balance transfer fees: Most balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically ranging from 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
Credit card interest: A 0% APR balance transfer card will start charging interest at the end of the 0% intro period, giving you a good incentive to pay down as much as you can during the interim. It’s also possible to lose your 0% rate if you miss a payment. And, if you make any purchases with the card, that spending will accrue interest at the purchase APR (which may or may not be 0%).

The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 

If you don’t qualify for a 0% APR balance transfer, you may still be able to transfer a balance to a credit card—but it probably won’t be a cost-saving move, because normal credit card rates tend to be relatively high.9

Costs of Debt Payoff Apps

Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.

Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.

Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.

App	How It Works	Cost
Undebt.it	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $12/year for premium subscription
Debt Payoff Planner	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $2/month for premium subscription
Qapital	Create an automated holistic financial plan, including a debt payoff plan	Free 30-day trial, then $3–$12/month
Bright Money	Create an automated financial plan, including round-ups to pay down debt faster	$10/month–$89/year
Debt Payoff Assistant	Very basic debt snowball planning tool	Free
Costs of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.10

After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:

Court costs: You’ll typically need to pay over $300 to file various documents with your local bankruptcy court (fee waivers or installment payments are sometimes accepted).
Attorney fees: Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,000—or more—to hire an attorney.
Credit counseling/debtor education course fees: Those who file bankruptcy must enroll in credit counseling and debtor education courses. The price for each course is capped at $50, although you’ll often pay less than half of that.1

Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.11 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:

Credit damage: Bankruptcy stays on your credit reports for up to 10 years.12 During that period, it may be difficult for you to get approved for credit, utilities, and even rental housing. The severity of the negative effects decreases over time, however.
Social stigma: People who file for bankruptcy may be treated poorly by others, even if the debt wasn’t their fault in the first place.

Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.

If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”

Don’t forget to look up free legal aid clinics and support available in your area, especially if you’re on a limited income or from an underserved community.

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 

“There are debt relief options for just about anyone who owes money,” said Tayne. “Generally, though, once you know there’s an issue with keeping up on payments, that’s the best time to look for a debt relief option.”

It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.

Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:

Starting (or refining) a budget
Asking for help from family and friends
Cutting expenses and increasing income

The average household was $23,317 in the red, excluding mortgage debt, in the second quarter of 2023.13 That kind of debt can add unhealthy stress to your life, making it harder to make ends meet and get ahead in life.

The Bottom Line

You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 

Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. 

Do Debt Relief Companies Charge a Fee?

Generally, yes; most types of debt relief companies charge some type of fee, although some options are free. Here’s a quick rundown of the costs you can expect, according to Investopedia research:

Debt settlement companies: Typically 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Certain services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and for balance transfer cards, balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, with much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1
How Does Debt Relief Affect Your Credit?

Different debt relief methods have different effects on your credit. Debt payoff apps, credit counseling, and debt management plans don’t have any direct impact on your credit score.14 At the other end of the extreme, bankruptcy and debt settlement have the potential to cause severe damage to your credit that can take years to overcome.

How Long Does Debt Relief Last?

Depending on the type of debt relief program you choose, it could be very quick or take a long time. If you’re just looking for help in making your payments, consolidating your high-interest debt into one personal loan can sometimes be completed in a day. On the other hand, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan can take up to five years to complete.12

Is Debt Relief Worth It?

“In general, if you take the time to research your options and choose a reputable organization or professional, the initial costs will be transparent from the get-go and well worth the savings and relief you get as a result,” said Tayne. To ensure you’re happy with your decision, it’s important to compare all your options and research the full range of costs, including indirect ones such as taxes owed on settled debt. 

How Much Debt Is Too Much?

If you’re having trouble making your monthly payments, you have too much debt. A more specific number to keep in mind, especially for would-be homebuyers, is a debt-to-income ratio of 43%; above this mark, most lenders won’t approve you for a conventional mortgage.15 Some debt-averse people are more concerned about the total amount of their debt. By paying down their debt faster they may be able to sleep better at night, even if their monthly payments are currently manageable. "
best practices for creating an emergency fund,investopedia,How to Build Generational Wealth,Help your heirs benefit from your success by building a strong financial foundation that includes an estate plan and maximizes tax savings.,https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-build-generational-wealth-8417999,"Generational wealth refers to assets passed down from one generation to the next. Building generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and opportunities for your children, grandchildren, and beyond.

Generational wealth is about more than just financial resources, according to Taylor Kovar, certified financial planner (CFP) and CEO of 11 Financial in Lufkin, Texas. “Its value extends beyond the monetary aspect—it’s also about imparting enduring family values and wisdom, creating a legacy that benefits and shapes the lives of future generations,” he said.

Learn more about why generational wealth is important, how to lay the foundations to build wealth for your family, and how to ensure that your legacy is passed on in the most efficient way.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generational wealth refers to passing down assets from one generation to the next.
Before you can build generational wealth, you must create a strong financial foundation by prioritizing savings, growing an emergency fund, and thinking through future plans.
Generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and open opportunities for your children and beyond.
Strategies for building generational wealth include investing in education, financial markets, and real estate, and creating and preserving assets.
Maximizing tax benefits and avoiding debt are crucial for building generational wealth.
The Importance of Building Generational Wealth

Achieving financial success takes a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and planning. Not only can it help you enjoy things in your lifetime, but it can also help your heirs reap the benefits of your legacy and enjoy a financially secure lifestyle after you’re gone.

Think of it as a wealth snowball. For example, generational wealth paves the way for enhanced educational opportunities and, consequently, greater earning potential for your kids, according to Kovar. And then they can continue building upon that foundation for their kids (your grandkids).

The Challenges of Building Generational Wealth 

Building generational wealth is not an easy undertaking, but it’s especially challenging if you grow up in poverty or face systemic barriers. Unfortunately, that has been the experience of many marginalized groups in this country.

For instance, in 2019, the median wealth of White families was 6.5 times that of Black families, 5.5 times that of Hispanic families, and 2.7 times that of Asian and other families, according to the Congressional Budget Office.1

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, data from the St. Louis Fed showed that Black families owned about 23 cents for every $1 of White family wealth, on average. Hispanic families owned about 19 cents for every $1 of White family wealth.2 

Contributing to this racial wealth gap is the fact that Black Americans are less likely to own a home, which is one of the major ways that people pass on wealth.3 The underlying reason for this is, in part, systemic discriminatory practices in home selling, home lending, and appraisals that have been well-documented in recent decades.

Black Americans and other marginalized groups have also historically had less access to banking and financial services and lower credit scores, which has locked them out of various investment opportunities.

If building generational wealth is a goal of yours, there are a few financial moves you can make that can help you achieve this.

Build a Strong Financial Foundation

Building generational wealth is as much about setting a strong example as it is about making the right financial decisions. You can model the building blocks of healthy personal finances to your family, which includes the following best practices.

Prioritize Savings

“It’s not how much you make, but how much you keep. That’s the key to accumulating savings and wealth,” says J.B. Beckett, founder of Beckett Financial Group in West Columbia, South Carolina.

Many people fall into the trap of saying they’ll save what’s left over at the end of the month but never end up getting around to it, or they spend beyond their means. A better approach is to create a budget to control your spending so that you have guaranteed funds available to save and set up an automatic payment to yourself each month.

Here’s how to get started:

Pick a percentage or dollar amount that you are able to allocate toward savings goals after your expenses are covered.
If you have more than one savings goal, create separate accounts for each one.
Consider a high-yield savings account that earns interest on top of your contributions.
Set up automatic payments to each savings account and watch them grow.

For longer-term savings goals, you might consider putting money in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts for a guaranteed return.

Build an Emergency Fund

One of the most important tools for building generational wealth is making sure that you have financial security in case of an emergency or loss of income. That’s where an emergency fund comes in.

Oftentimes, not having an emergency fund is what leads people into debt or causes them to cash out retirement accounts, which not only incurs penalties but also comes with a big opportunity cost.

Ultimately, you want to end up with enough money saved to cover a few months’ worth of expenses, but that will take some time to build up. In the interim, focus on making regular, automated contributions, and save more aggressively if you find ways to trim expenses or develop new income streams. Most important is that you avoid the temptation to withdraw money from the account—it must be reserved for true emergencies.

Involve Kids in Money Conversations

One often-overlooked aspect of building a strong financial foundation is involving your family, and children specifically, in the conversation. This way, they can understand financial basics from a young age, alongside you.

Kevin M. Curley II, certified financial planner and financial advisor at Global Wealth Advisors in Dallas, Texas, recommends including children in the family finances from a young age through fun and games.

“Play Monopoly and teach them poker at the kitchen table,” Curley says. “Consider giving them an allowance and discuss how they plan to spend it. Later, let them invest a small amount in their favorite video game designer or cosmetics manufacturer and track wins and losses together.”

Invest in Education

Once you’ve made some progress on your emergency fund, you can allocate some of your discretionary income toward other big financial goals. A popular one is to save for your children’s education. If you’re aiming to build generational wealth, you can think of college savings for your kids as an investment in their future earning power.

That’s because degree attainment is directly correlated with an increase in lifetime earnings—in the millions, as a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found. According to the study, someone with a high school diploma can expect to earn $1.3 million over a lifetime; a bachelor’s degree holder will earn $2.3 million; a master’s degree can lead to $2.7 million in lifetime earnings; and a professional degree holder can earn $3.6 million.4

Note

Of course, the costs of education are continuing to rise, and it may not be the best option for everyone. It’s best to take a comprehensive look at your financial situation and life goals before deciding to invest in education.

Consider opening a 529 plan, which is a tax-advantaged account that is tax-free when used for eligible educational expenses.5 

Invest in Financial Markets

To build wealth in a meaningful way, the sooner you get started, the better. “Starting early and consistently saving, even in smaller amounts, can lead to significant growth over time, thanks to the power of compound interest,” Kovar says.

While investing in the stock market comes with some risk, if you diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, you can balance risk with growth potential. One popular strategy for beginners is to invest in index funds, which is a collection of many stocks designed to mimic the performance of major market indexes like the S&P 500.

The key to investing in the stock market is to think of it in the long term by riding out the downturns since, historically, it usually bounces back.

Invest in Real Estate

Another popular investment avenue to explore is real estate, thanks to its potential rental income and appreciation in property value. Plus, it’s a strong investment to pass on to your next of kin.

“Exploring various property types, from residential to commercial, can diversify your real estate portfolio,” Kovar says.

If you’re not ready for that level of investment or don’t want the commitment of running a property, Beckett suggests looking into real estate investment trusts (REITs).

Create and Preserve Assets

Building wealth is just step one in creating generational wealth. The next part is making sure that your assets are protected so that they remain available to pass on to future generations. You also want your heirs to be able to retain as much of their inheritance (if relevant) as possible, which is why tax implications come into play.

To ensure your children are protected and set up in the best possible way financially, consider the following actions.

Build an Estate Plan

As your assets grow and become more complex, working with financial professionals and attorneys on estate planning is the smart move. Some considerations include:

Creating a business that you can pass down 
Considering life insurance. “Life insurance is one of the most tax-efficient vehicles to pass on wealth,” Beckett says.
Making sure other insurance needs are met. Make sure you’re covered in case of a catastrophic event involving your home, car, or a medical event. If not, one incident or lawsuit could wipe out your savings.
Maximize Tax Benefits

A number of tax-efficient investing strategies and vehicles can help you retain a greater share of your returns. Some strategies include:

Tax-deferred accounts: Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, offering you an upfront tax break as you invest. You pay taxes when you withdraw your money in retirement.67
Tax-exempt accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are tax-exempt when you withdraw, since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.8
Health savings accounts (HSAs): You contribute tax-free and enjoy tax-free growth. Then, if used for eligible medical expenses, money comes out tax-free, too.9

Work with a tax accountant or financial advisor to learn what strategies are best for you, and ultimately shield the most money from taxes as possible.

Avoid Debt and Financial Pitfalls

Living within your means and having a healthy emergency fund are the two best ways to avoid unnecessary, high-interest debt like high credit card balances. Those types of borrowing costs can prevent you from making progress on your savings and wealth-building goals.

If you do have some debt to contend with, prioritize paying your highest-interest accounts, while still maintaining your contributions to your emergency fund and retirement accounts (though it’s OK to scale back temporarily). Try to use any windfalls of money such as tax returns or monetary gifts to pay off large chunks when those opportunities become available. 

How to Pass Down Generational Wealth

The last aspect of generational wealth is making sure it goes where you want it to go. This involves getting your wishes documented legally. At a very basic level, you can start with a will. But as finances get more complex, you’ll want to go beyond that, according to Curley.

Beckett recommends setting up a trust. “A trust can be efficient for bypassing probate if it’s set up properly,” he says. “And it’s private. If it’s in a trust, it’s not public record.”

Once you have your affairs in order, keep the lines of communication open with your family, letting them know your plans and how to access your documents. This is beneficial on the off chance that a sudden emergency happens and your family needs to take over the financial plans.

How Can I Start Building Generational Wealth If I Have Limited Financial Resources?

Take it one small step at a time. Create a budget that allows you to allocate money toward savings each month. Make lifestyle choices that help fuel your financial goals. And invest in your retirement as early as possible to give it time to grow.

What Are Some Tax-Efficient Strategies for Maximizing Generational Wealth?

There are many tax-efficient strategies that you may consider adopting, such as investing in tax-deferred accounts or Health Savings Accounts. The route you choose to go will depend on your own personal financial situation, so you may want to work with a tax professional or financial advisor. Plus, these individuals can help you stay current with any new tax rules as they are established.

How Can I Protect My Assets and Ensure They Are Passed Down to Future Generations?

Making sure you’re properly insured (through home, auto, and life insurance) and working with an estate planner are the two best ways to protect your assets. In addition, be sure you at least have a will, and consider establishing a trust.

The Bottom Line

If you’re a first-generation wealth builder, committing to taking those first steps of saving money, building an emergency fund, and starting to invest for the long term and following through with consistency will eventually pay off.

Though it might take some sacrifice upfront, building generational wealth has both short- and long-term benefits that make it worth the effort. In your lifetime, you’ll get to enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that your loved ones will be well taken care of financially. You can also share your knowledge and insights with your children and grandchildren to help instill strong financial habits that can help them keep the family legacy strong for the next generation."

Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.

Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.

The core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection.
Smart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more.
Being disciplined is important, but it’s also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines.

The Importance of Personal Finance

Personal finance is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).

Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:

Credit card balances: Up by $27 billion
Auto loans: Up by $10 billion
Consumer loans and store cards: Up by $1 billion
Total non-housing: Up by $28 billion
Mortgages: Up by $77 billion

Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.

Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.


Areas of Personal Finance

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.

Income

Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.

Spending

Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.

Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.

Saving

Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.

Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.

Investing

Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.

Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.

Protection

Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.

Personal Finance Services

Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:

Wealth Management
Loans and Debt
Budgeting
Retirement
Taxes
Risk Management
Estate Planning
Investments
Insurance
Credit Cards
Home and Mortgage
Personal Finance Strategies

The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.

The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey surveyed 4,000 adults and found that most Americans are concerned about personal finance basics, retirement funding, and investing in crypto.

1. Know Your income

It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.

2. Devise a Budget

A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:

Fifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.
Thirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.
Twenty percent goes toward the future—paying down debt and saving for retirement and emergencies.

It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:

YNAB (You Need a Budget) helps you track and adjust your spending to control every dollar you spend.
PocketGuard is available in both free and paid versions. It uses an algorithm to help you avoid overspending by analyzing your income, bills, goals, and budget.
3. Pay Yourself First

It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.

Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.

4. Limit and Reduce Debt

It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.

On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.

Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it. There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.

Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:

Graduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years
Extended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years
Income-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)
5. Only Borrow What You Can Repay

Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.

Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).

Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.

Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs, and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your credit score is to constantly pay bills late—or even worse, miss payments.

Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.

6. Monitor Your Credit Score

Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.

Factors that determine your FICO score include:

Payment history (35%)
Amounts owed (30%)
Length of credit history (15%)
Credit mix (10%)
New credit (10%)

FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850. Here’s how your credit is rated:

Exceptional: 800 to 850
Very good: 740 to 799
Good: 670 to 739
Fair: 580 to 669
Poor: 579 and below

To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.

Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three major credit bureaus are providing free credit reports weekly. The program was extended twice in 2022 and it is now permanent.

7. Plan for Your Future

To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.

Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.

Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.

Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).

While your children are young, take the time to teach them about the value of money and how to save, invest, and spend wisely.

If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.

Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.

8. Buy Insurance

As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.

Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt. If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.

9. Maximize Tax Breaks

Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.

You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.

After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.

10. Give Yourself a Break

Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.

Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.

Personal Finance Skills

The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.

Finance Prioritization: This means that you can look at your finances, discern what keeps the money flowing in, and make sure that you stay focused on those efforts.
Assessing the Costs and Benefits: This key skill keeps professionals from spreading themselves too thin. Ambitious individuals always have a list of ideas about other ways that they can hit it big, whether it is a side business or an investment idea. While there is a place and time for taking a flier, running your finances like a business means stepping back and honestly assessing the potential costs and benefits of any new venture.
Restraining Your Spending: This is the final big-picture skill of successful business management that must be applied to personal finances. Time and again, financial planners sit down with successful people who still manage to spend more than they make. Earning $250,000 a year won’t do you much good if you spend $275,000 annually. Learning to restrain spending on non-wealth-building assets until after you’ve met your monthly savings or debt reduction goals is crucial in building net worth.
Personal Finance Education

Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.

Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.

Online Blogs

Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.

Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.

Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.

At the Library

You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.

Free Online Classes

If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:

Morningstar Investing Classroom offers a place for beginning and experienced investors alike to learn about stocks, funds, bonds, and portfolios. Some of the courses you’ll find include “Stocks Versus Other Investments,” “Methods for Investing in Mutual Funds,” “Determining Your Asset Mix,” and “Introduction to Government Bonds.” Each course takes about 10 minutes and is followed by a quiz to help you make sure that you understood the lesson.
EdX is an online learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It offers at least three courses that cover personal finance: 'Personal Finance, Part 1: Investing in Yourself"" from Wellesley College, “Personal Finance” from Purdue University, and “Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making” from the University of Michigan. These courses will teach you how credit works, which types of insurance you might want to carry, how to maximize your retirement savings, how to read your credit report, and what the time value of money is.
“Planning for a Secure Retirement” is an online course from Purdue University. It’s broken up into 10 main modules, and each has four to six sub-modules on topics such as Social Security, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs. You’ll learn about your risk tolerance, think about what kind of retirement lifestyle you want, and estimate your retirement expenses.
Podcasts

Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:

Freakonomics Radio and NPR’s Planet Money both make economics enjoyable by using it to explain real-world phenomena such as “how we got from mealy, nasty apples to apples that actually taste delicious,” the Wells Fargo fake-accounts scandal, and whether we should still be using cash.
American Public Media’s Marketplace helps make sense of what’s happening in the business world and the economy.
So Money with Farnoosh Torabi combines interviews with successful business people, expert advice, and listeners’ personal finance questions.

The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.

Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.

What Personal Finance Classes Can’t Teach You

Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:

Discipline

One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.

There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).

To be eligible for a health savings account, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).

Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.

Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.

A Sense of Timing

Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""

However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.

The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.

Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.

Emotional Detachment

Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.

Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.

The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.

Many people have loved ones who always seem to need financial help—it is difficult to refuse to help them. If you include planning to assist them in real emergencies using your emergency fund, it can make the burden easier.

Breaking Personal Finance Rules

The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.

Saving or Investing a Set Portion of Your Income

An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.

For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.

Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.

Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.

Long-term Investing/Investing in Riskier Assets

The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.

Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.

The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.

At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.

What Is an Example of Personal Finance?

One of the key ideas behind personal finance is not to spend more than you make. For instance, if you make $50,000 a year but spend $65,000, you'll end up with debt that continues to compound because you'll be spending more than you make to pay for past expenses.

Why Is Personal Finance So Important?

The concepts behind managing your personal finances can guide you in making intelligent financial decisions. In addition, the decisions you make throughout your life on what to buy, sell, hold, or own can affect how you live when you can no longer work.

The Bottom Line

Understanding how to manage your finances is an important life-planning tool that can help set you up for a life without debt; you gain control of financial stresses and have a way to manage the expensive surprises that life can throw at you."
best practices for creating an emergency fund,investopedia,"Best Practices: Definition in Business, How To Develop, Examples","Best practices are a set of guidelines, ethics, or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action for a business or investor.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp,"What Are Best Practices?

Best practices are a set of guidelines, ethics, or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action in a given business situation.

Best practices may be established by authorities, such as regulators, self-regulatory organizations (SROs), or other governing bodies, or they may be internally decreed by a company's management team.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Best practices are the working standards or ethical guidelines that provide the best course(s) of action in a given situation.
Companies, regulators, or governing bodies can all set best practices for businesses.
Best practices serve as a roadmap for a company on how to do business and provide the best way to deal with problems and issues that arise.
Steps to setting best practices include researching the industry and competitors, communicating the standards to all employees, setting metrics, managing change, evaluating and refining the best practices.
Two common best practices that have been implemented for inventory management include ""just in time"" and ""kaizen.""
How Best Practices Work

Best practices serve as a general framework for a variety of situations. For instance, in businesses that produce physical products, best practices that highlight efficient ways to complete tasks might be given to employees. Best practices lists may also outline safety procedures in order to minimize employee injuries.

For corporate accountants, the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) represent best practices. GAAP is a common set of accounting standards which aim to improve the clarity, consistency, and comparability of the communication of financial information.

GAAP facilitates the cross-comparison of financial information across different companies within the same sector. This benefits investors and the companies they invest in by promoting transparency.

Investment managers may follow best practices when handling a client's money by prudently investing in a well-diversified portfolio and adhering to a client's risk tolerances, time horizons, and retirement goals.

Corporate governance or a code of ethics can serve as best practices for an organization.

Special Considerations

""Best practices"" is a term that can be applied broadly and across a swath of industries. In the world of business, the phrase is used in connection with everything from project management to audit functions to explain the most efficient method of completing a business task.

With the advent of newer quality control systems came the need for a way to apply measurable benchmarks and communicate ways to rapidly implement new standards of excellence across an organization. This is done by identifying problems, quantifying their frequencies, cultivating solutions, and monitoring the execution of those solutions to ensure they solve the issues at hand.

Best Practices as Industry Benchmarks

Best practices can also be used as a benchmark where one company can share actionable solutions with other organizations. Say there's a firm well-known for its best-in-class product distribution infrastructure. When asked to precisely describe the best practices that led to their hyper-efficiency, the company reveals that it outfits all fulfillment staffers with red markers that they may use to sign off on their highest priority deliveries.

Consequently, all red ink orders are given higher levels of scrutiny than others. As more eyes reflexively search for errors when they see red ink, more mistakes can be flagged and corrected.

Although companies share their best practices as a matter of routine, revealing trade secrets that might be easily replicated by the competition would be unwise.

Steps for Developing Best Practices

Here are eight steps for developing best practices:

Do your homework: Research what companies in your industry do regarding best practices, in terms of customer service, hiring, promotions, production, and anything else of import.
Share your information: Once you have determined what best practices are important, communicate this to key individuals in your company so that everyone is on the same page.
Define your metrics: When you determine your best practices make sure they are measurable so you can keep track of progress towards their implementation, and to boost accountability.
Manage change: Employees and others are typically resistant to change. Prepare for this resistance and develop a strategy to move forward when you implement new practices.
Modify and customize for your business: When implementing a best practice, modify it so that it meets the characteristics of your business and fits with your intended goals.
Involve everyone: Like sharing your information, make certain that everyone in the organization is aware of best practices and that they have agreed to abide by them.
Align business and customer needs: Seek guidance from other businesses or customers that might be able to help you refine and better implement your best practices.
Evaluate and refine: As your business evolves, take stock of your best practices and refine if necessary to meet the ways that your organization has changed.
Examples of Best Practices
Just in Time

Just in time (JIT) is a best practices solution focused on inventory that seeks to align materials ordered from suppliers to a production schedule. The goal of JIT is to ensure efficiency and reduce waste by only receiving materials when needed. While this trims inventory costs, it requires businesses to forecast demand for their goods accurately to ensure proper amounts of supplies are on hand.

Kaizen

Kaizen is a Japanese management philosophy that seeks to improve productivity gradually and methodically. It is a Japanese word that means ""change for the better"" or ""continuous improvement.""

Kaizen seeks to involve all employees and improve operations on a continuous basis. Characteristics of kaizen include designing a workplace to be more efficient and impactful by creating a team atmosphere, improving everyday procedures, making sure employees are engaged, and seeking to make jobs more fulfilling, safer, and less tiring.

Best Practices for Investors

With so many stocks to choose from, it can be hard to know which one to pick for your portfolio. In choosing a stock, it's important to know what you want your portfolio to look like and to keep that in mind as time goes by.

As an investor, it's critical to be aware of daily news, not only for the companies you are analyzing or have already invested in but also for world and financial news, as these impact stocks as well. Reading the news is probably the first step in deciding what stock to pick. Understanding which companies are trending, what sectors are primed to do well, and where the economy is heading, will give you an idea of where to start looking.

From there, start compiling a list of stocks that interest you. For example, if you read that new technology has emerged that has made another product obsolete (for example, smartphones making traditional landlines obsolete), you may start looking into such companies.

You can find stocks through research of who the main players are in the sector you are interested in. Conversely, you can look at exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the sector. You can also use screeners to sort through companies based on a variety of factors, such as market cap and earnings. From there, a detailed analysis of a company's financial statements would provide you with information you need regarding the company's health.

What Are Best Practices in Education?

Best practices in education include staying proactive by ensuring your next teaching activity is prepared and set to go before the current one finishes. This allows students to be engaged by reducing disruptions. Encourage communication by involving students in the classroom setting. This can include varying the way in which they provide answers (e.g. verbal, written, visual, in groups, etc.). Work backward by setting an end goal and figuring out how to reach that goal with your students. Always keep your resources, such as lesson plans, so you can build upon what you have done before and refine the way you approach teaching. And lastly, be a role model by setting the examples you want your students to exhibit.

What Are Best Practices in Healthcare?

Best practices in healthcare include training your staff so that they know how to deliver great service and put patient care and experience as their main priority. Ensure patient education, which has been proven to improve the overall healthcare experience. A patient that understands the what and why of their health and the care they are getting are usually happier and more comfortable. Establish a care-orientated environment by incorporating small details, such as remembering a patient's name, smiling, listening carefully, and incorporating follow-up calls.

What Are Best Practices in Customer Service?

Good customer service starts with good employees. Ensure you are hiring the best people and incentivizing them to join your firm and stay. This can be done through good pay and benefits as well as the overall corporate environment.

Manage customer expectations. Telling a customer that everything will be taken care of is easy, but this isn't always the case. Being upfront and honest with a customer will always keep them grounded and prevent them from being disappointed.

With customer service, first impressions count. Make sure the first impression is perfect. This sets the tone for future engagement and shapes customers' opinions of the service they're receiving. Collect as much data as you can to help them and also personalize the experience.

debt-free strategy mindset shifts effectiveness,investopedia,How to Talk About Money with Your Partner,"Learning how to talk about money with your partner can help you manage conflict, create more meaningful financial goals, and build trust. Here’s what you need to know.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-partner-8612447,"Having open conversations about finances is essential for any healthy romantic relationship. But no matter how long you’ve been lovebirds, bringing up money can feel awkward and uncomfortable.

A February 2023 study by Bread Financial found that baby boomers tend to discuss finances with their partners the least of any generation—only 13% of those surveyed admitted to talking about finances daily. Millennials were a different story; 39% claimed to discuss money daily with their partners. Yet, the study also found that “58% of millennials and 57% of Gen Z’ers report arguments with their partner over finances at least occasionally, whereas only 30% of boomers do the same.”1 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Open communication about money is crucial for a healthy relationship.
Building trust about money matters and setting shared financial goals can strengthen your relationship.
Approach the conversation about money with empathy and understanding.
Create financial transparency by discussing income, expenses, and budgeting.

Not all money conversations are good ones, and there is such a thing as talking about the topic too much. Rather than prioritize frequency, it is best to focus on quality.

Certified financial planner R.J. Weiss says one of the easiest ways to start is to “Concentrate on future goals instead of past spending habits. Start with a question like, ‘What do we want our finances to look like in three years?’” This kind of open-ended question avoids finger pointing and provides a neutral starting point to discuss how each of you values money.

Regular and healthy talks about money can help you and your partner unpack financial fears and money scripts, as well as plan for financial independence and shared milestones.

Talking About Money Matters

A recent Forbes Advisor survey of 1,000 divorcees found that their number one reason for getting married was financial security (42%). Although finances didn’t top the reasons why they divorced, money matters played a significant role in common conflicts among couples who wound up divorcing. Forty-six percent reported career choices as the most prevalent topic of disagreement, while 43% said the division of household labor, and 28% named finances.2

If not addressed proactively, money issues like conflicting spending habits, opposing views on saving and investing, and dead-end jobs can breed resentment over time. Keeping lines of communication open within couples is essential to the overall solvency of a committed relationship, but it is just the first step. Discussing spending priorities, savings goals, and debt management can help you find compromises and solutions as a team.

Next, you may need to have financial conversations with children, aging parents, ex-spouses, co-parents, business partners, and anyone else who relies on your household income. Setting priorities within your partnership can help you speak with one voice when discussing boundaries with dependents.

Establish a Foundation of Trust

Many people were raised to believe that talking about money is rude or taboo. Raising the topic of money before your relationship is on solid emotional ground can feel like a recipe for disaster.

Yet, early transparency around money can help you determine if this partnership is going to work in the long term. It is less about how much money is in each bank account and more about whether you both see eye to eye about how you spend, save, and value money.

Starting these conversations from a nonjudgmental place helps both partners feel safe to reveal the emotions behind their money habits and to shift to more sustainable patterns in the future.

Weiss says it’s best to make financial discussions a regular part of your relationship routine, at least monthly. This normalizes conversations—rather than arguments—about money. You can use a common monthly billing cycle as the anchor to review your numbers. If you want to dig deeper into concepts, you can agree to read a personal finance book or listen to a money-focused podcast and discuss it monthly.

These periodic check-ins are opportunities to disclose money woes and craft strategies together. There are also times to acknowledge wins like promotions, investment growth, and debt paydown. Knowing your partner can handle the good and the bad is really what healthy relationships are made of.

However, you must expect that these conversations are going to be emotional. Try not to lash out in fear or anger when gathering new information about your partner’s money hygiene. Also, don’t beat yourself up about any slip-ups throughout the month. Listen with empathy and devise a plan to set things right. The intention is to build a culture of accountability and discipline, not one of extreme austerity or shame.

It may take time and care, but openly sharing money experiences without blame ultimately builds trust and strengthens intimacy.

Get Excited About Shared Financial Goals

The best part of sharing a life with someone is the prospect of doing what you love with someone you love.

Chances are, shared interests are what brought you and your partner together in the first place. Hone in on the meaningful life events and accomplishments you’d like to share with each other, and build conversations around the part each of you will play in ensuring that those milestones come to pass.

Once you get past the initial awkwardness, setting shared money goals can be incredibly bonding.

“Couples should set goals both individually and together and should understand what each of them is trying to accomplish and work towards,” says Lawrence D. Sprung, a wealth advisor and the host of the Mitlin Money Mindset podcast. “Although income and salaries may be different, as long as your goals are aligned, the combined incomes should be viewed as being available towards both your individual goals [and your goals] as a couple.”

Talking about money with your partner ensures that you both have a solid game plan to advance your lives as a couple.

Use These Tips to Talk to Your Partner About Money


Choosing the right time and place for money discussions ensures a nonconfrontational and supportive environment to tackle what could be a sensitive topic for you or your partner. These are effective strategies for initiating a conversation about money with your partner:

Work Through the Details

At first glance, figuring out the nitty-gritty of budgeting and expenses together can feel really overwhelming.

To make combining your finances more manageable, both partners have to be honest about their incomes, debts, and other financial obligations. Excessive privacy or vagueness breeds mistrust. Trust that you can share the details with your partner and that they won’t judge you but instead serve as a supportive sounding board.

Married couples can file their U.S. taxes jointly or separately. While filing jointly is most common, filing separately can be advantageous if there are large differences in medical bills, debts, and income between partners. The details matter.

Discuss Debt

“The important thing here is to have an honest and transparent conversation about your respective debt,” Sprung says. “Put it all on the table and begin to have a conversation about who is going to take care of the debt, one of you or both, and put a plan together to start extinguishing it immediately so you can start off on a clean slate as a couple.”

Couples approach debt in various ways. Some combine finances and include premarital debt in their joint financial goals, while others choose not to work together to pay off individual debt.

“Another approach I’ve seen work is to split debt repayment based on each partner’s income level,” Weiss says. “This method makes a lot of sense when the partner with higher debt, often due to student loans, also has a higher income.”

If either of you is carrying debt from a prior relationship, expect that these discussions might be more heated than those related to the debt you accumulate together. Rely on the foundation of trust to create a plan that you both can commit to.

Use Technology

Gone are the days of spreadsheets and shoe boxes full of receipts. Instead, you can use trackers on your credit and bank cards to closely monitor spending. If you share cards, all the transactions will be visible and accessible to discuss at your monthly money meeting. If you want to combine your finances, try apps that combine bank accounts and track spending as you swipe. 

The budgeting app Mint switched to Credit Karma in 2024 and no longer offers the same budgeting features. However, it will keep past data around net worth and add new finance trackers.3 The EveryDollar app and YNAB (You Need a Budget) are paid alternatives.

To curb frivolous spending or celebrate debt paydown, you can agree to set spending alerts on your accounts. Establish autopay to avoid any penalties or late fees. Don’t rely solely on memory and willpower to reach your collective goals, especially long-term ones like retiring, buying a house, or paying off student loans and consumer debt.

Swap ‘Shoulds’ for ‘Coulds’

Personal finance conversations are often laden with regret, no matter how much or how little money a person has. Hindsight is 20/20, and most people recognize that they could have made smarter money decisions at some point.

Rather than focus on what you or your partner should have done in the past, focus on the future. Consider what you could do now and which strategies resonate most with your financial goals. When talking about money, trade past-oriented shoulds with forward-thinking coulds.

For example, instead of criticizing yourself (or your partner) for not sticking to the budget last month, focus on adjustments that will help you stay on track next month. Keep a positive and hopeful attitude when addressing household finances.

Don’t Wait

It is easy to put off money conversations, but don’t wait too long. It’s better to have early and regular communication about finances in flux than to wait for a perfect moment that isn’t likely to come.

There will always be a payment that hasn’t cleared or an account issue to troubleshoot. That’s the very purpose of having these conversations regularly. Together, you can build solid money habits within your partnership and share oversight of your financial life.

Make It an Occasion

“Make these conversations something you look forward to. I’ve seen couples order takeout from one of their favorite restaurants, get dressed up, or open a bottle of wine,” Weiss says.

These money chats on a date night can be great for confirming if your timeline for the future will match up with the growth of your savings and investment accounts. They can also mark money wins for one or both of you. And these enjoyable settings can mute the blow of financial setbacks.

However, these occasions aren’t ideal for crunching numbers or tackling highly sensitive points of contention. In both cases, you should work with a professional. Accountants, couples counselors, and even tax preparers should be consulted in their offices or in a quiet, private setting where you can get the most value from their expertise.

Seek Outside Help When Needed

Sometimes, you and your partner might feel stuck on money issues even after repeated constructive attempts to work through things together. To get unstuck, consider getting unbiased guidance from a financial professional. Certified experts are required to stay abreast of the latest trends, tools, and tactics to make the most of any situation.

If talks consistently get heated and communication breaks down, try couples counseling to have a neutral party on hand to moderate difficult conversations. A therapist can help reveal the root issues driving money conflicts and provide tools to discuss finances in a healthy manner.

Meeting with a couples financial advisor can offer an impartial outside perspective. An expert can assess your complete financial picture collaboratively and map out customized strategies to help you gain clarity on financial decisions or overcome hurdles.

Other professionals you should seek include career counselors, headhunters, investment advisors, bank account managers, and more.

Tip

Debtors Anonymous offers free in-person, online, and phone-based fellowship for singles and couples looking to change their mindset about money.

How Can I Start the Money Talk without Causing a Fight?

Don’t spring it on your spouse or partner suddenly, and don’t come on too strong. Ease into it by mentioning that you’d like to set aside time to casually discuss your hopes and goals related to money. Pick a relaxed day without distractions. Frame it as a chance to dream together, not point fingers.

What Are Some Usual Challenges That Couples Have with Money?

Some of the most common money issues between couples include fears about the economy, saving vs. spending, and how to communicate about money, according to an Orion survey. Nearly half of couples surveyed said that they considered dishonesty about money a form of infidelity.4

How Can Shared Goals Help?

Having a common vision to work toward builds unity and teamwork. It motivates you to compromise or make sacrifices for each other’s benefit. Having a singular and shared goal can also highlight your money strengths and weaknesses. Together, you can improve habits that will sustain your relationship.

Are There Resources for Managing Money as a Couple?

Yes. Try apps like Honeydue or Zeta. They help couples budget and track finances together. Sites like CoupleWise offer courses and tips. Or meet with a financial advisor or counselor for personalized guidance.

When Should We Seek Outside Help with Money Issues?

If you constantly argue about the same topics, don’t struggle alone. Seek counseling or financial help. Money is a top cause of relationship problems, but professionals can help.

What Are Financial Red Flags in a Partner That I Shouldn’t Ignore?

Secrecy about money, uncontrolled spending, reckless gambling or investing, avoiding paying debts, and repeated unwillingness to discuss finances openly can be problematic. Use caution if these are ongoing concerns.

The Bottom Line

Transparent communication is crucial for a healthy relationship, money talks included.

Start with trust and empathy. These early discussions can focus on establishing a baseline of understanding about how your individual money scripts need to change if you’re going to share a future. Raising financial matters with your partner isn’t just about discussing debt. You also need to set shared financial goals, discuss career and income changes, and adjust budgets to suit your needs.

Since financial plans change over a lifetime, expect that the discussion will always continue. Pace yourself. If some topics are heavier than others, give it time and patience before revisiting intractable issues with the help of experts. Whether you combine finances or keep them separate, neither partner should be kept in the dark. Financial transparency is a pillar of a successful relationship.

debt-free strategy mindset shifts effectiveness,investopedia,Getting Real: How to Talk About Money with Friends,"Talking about money with friends can be tricky. However, with the right ground rules, you can use these discussions to gain valuable perspective and advice.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-friends-8608029,"Money is a deeply personal topic. But by keeping our finances under wraps from friends, we may be missing out on valuable advice, deeper relationships, and new perspectives.

“Having a friend or a group of friends that you can talk to about money can radically shift your relationship with it,” says Grant Sabatier, author of Financial Freedom and creator of Millennial Money. “The more you think about money and talk about money, the more comfortable that you get with it.”

Here are some helpful tips on how to start the conversation, set boundaries, and help one another toward financial independence.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Discussing money with friends can help you build stronger relationships and foster financial well-being.
Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is crucial for open and honest money conversations.
Starting the conversation with interesting and indirect questions can help break the ice and encourage participation.
Setting boundaries and expectations can prevent conflicts and ensure productive discussions.
Seeking educational resources and working with financial advisors and financial therapists can enhance your financial journey.
How to Start the Conversation

Before deciding what you want to talk about, you will want to determine who you want to talk with.

Casually incorporating personal finance topics into your conversations with friends can help you figure out which friends share your financial values and what tone you want the conversation to have. Here are some questions to open the conversation without getting into the nitty-gritty:

Are you more of a spender or a saver?
What’s more worth it: an experience or an item?
Can money buy happiness?

For me and many of my college-aged friends, investing in a Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), opening a high-yield savings account, or amassing a strong credit score are points of pride. As Sabatier suggests, speaking with friends in similar financial situations to your own helps you relate to one another without a sense of competition.

“Talking with people who were in the exact same situation as me about money was very, very effective,” Sabatier says. “It’s being on a life journey with someone else who’s where you’re at.”

How to Create a Judgment-Free Environment

Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is key to having constructive conversations and building relationships with your friends. Here are some tips for setting the tone and building trust.

Set Ground Rules 

Before you jump into a conversation, some financial experts advise setting ground rules and objectives.
1
 Here are some sample rules that I have used with my friends:

Keep the conversation confidential
Speak using “I” statements
Actively listen without interrupting
Do not pass judgment
Avoid comparisons

This step may feel overly formal, but it can help define the conversation’s terms and avoid later discomfort.

Lead by Example

Sabatier says that by embodying the tone that you want the conversation to take, your friends will be able to pick up on your language and demeanor to support a constructive conversation.

Especially if you’re initiating the conversation, you may need to demonstrate to your friends that an easy and comfortable money chat is achievable in the first place. Imagine if one of your friends approached you to discuss personal finance, and they immediately began passing judgments on your expenses, insisting that you use the same budget tracker that they do, or complaining about their own financial situation (which you know is more stable than your own). That would be horrible!

Modeling practices can help you avoid these situations and lay a foundation for success.

Adopt a Growth Mindset

You have a whole financial future ahead of you, and nothing is set in stone. Your financial situation will likely ebb and flow throughout your life, and centering growth and positivity in conversations with friends can improve your mindset and help you cultivate stronger financial relationships with your friends.

According to Kristin Wong, author of Get Money, a financial freedom guide for young people, confiding in friends about financial situations can be very helpful and reassuring.

“It can be really hard not to internalize our money challenges and see them as personal shortcomings,” Wong says. “Talking about those issues openly with a friend can make you feel a little less alone. Most of us have been there, and there’s a good chance your friends have, too.”

Set Boundaries and Expectations

The greatest risk when discussing money with friends is that the conversation becomes uncomfortable, and it jeopardizes your friendship. According to Sabatier and Wong, setting expectations and boundaries for money conversations can stop this problem at the root.

Personally, my precise account balances are off-limits to friends. Some of my friends are uncomfortable speaking about their financial support from their parents, and other friends choose not to talk about their college financial aid packages.

We each have different preferences, and being upfront about them can benefit your relationships in the long run.

“You can still have a candid conversation about money without sharing the nitty-gritty details of your financial life,” Wong says. “If you’re talking to the right person, you should feel comfortable setting boundaries on specific details, like your income or debt amounts, to maintain privacy and prevent any potential discomfort.”

If you do run into issues with navigating sensitive topics, it’s best to tackle any miscommunication or discomfort head-on. Some conflicts may represent a flaw in your approach to financial conversations with friends, and they could be signs to reevaluate boundaries or limits on advice.

Set Financial Goals Together

Setting financial goals with your friends can keep you motivated and improve your financial literacy. According to Wong, by sharing financial successes and failures, you can better evaluate your financial strategies.

“Friends in the same age group often face similar financial challenges: student loans, entry-level salaries, budget constraints, and so on,” Wong says. “Most young adults have a shared understanding of what it is to struggle financially, so you can create a community that fosters financial literacy and cheers each other on when it comes to financial goals.”

Address Differences in Financial Situations

When you’re in college, you and your friends all live in the same dorms and eat the same dining hall food, but when you’re in the real world, financial disparities between you and your friends will probably become more obvious—especially as you embark on different career paths.

It’s certainly not impossible to navigate money conversations with friends in different financial situations, especially if you share the same values. However, you should address financial differences head-on and approach these conversations intentionally, to prevent feelings of pity or resentment.

“You really have to come to it from a place of love, and respect, and understanding. Try to put yourself in the person’s shoes that you’re talking with, and recognize how you talk about money will make them feel,” Sabatier says. “If you have more money than them, often talking with someone who doesn’t have as much money can come off as bragging or make them feel bad because they’re not in this similar position.”

Seek Professional Help If Needed

While speaking about money with friends can be very helpful, these relationships have their limits, and you may want or need additional support from a financial advisor or educational source.

“You can get valuable insight from friends while also seeking help from a professional,” Wong says. “It’s like going to a therapist, right? A good therapist is going to help you process whatever you’re going through, but your friends can be there for you, too.”

Here are some helpful resources for finding a financial planner:

National Association of Personal Financial Advisors
CFP Board
XY Planning Network

Of course, hiring a financial advisor may not be financially realistic for many young people. According to Wong, older friends or colleagues can be helpful resources. You can also look into robo-advisor programs, which can help you manage your money for much less than a traditional financial advisor.

As Sabatier notes, a financial advisor can be very helpful, but you should always try to do your own research before seeking out a professional.

“​​Unfortunately, the financial industry is so predatory, and it’s really built around exploiting people and exploiting what they don’t know,” Sabatier says. “So if you know a little bit, you’re not gonna get scammed or the likelihood is gonna be a lot less, and you’re gonna be able to ask better questions for yourself.”

Here are some resources for self-education:

How Do You Start a Conversation Asking for Money?

Asking for money can be hard and often embarrassing. If you want to ask a friend or family member, it is important to approach the matter seriously, being direct and honest. You should explain why you need the money, provide a clear timeline for repayment, and thank the person for hearing you out.

Still, some experts in financial planning for young adults warn against lending or borrowing from friends and family.

“I think it’s probably best to avoid co-signing or lending money to friends because it has the potential to ruin friendships, and our friendships are more important than money,” Wong says.

Can a Friend or Family Member Help Me with Bill Paying and Banking?

You can ask a friend or family member to help you with bill paying and banking, but you should know that this move could come with uncomfortable consequences or power imbalances in your personal relationships.

If you have already decided that you want to ask a friend or family member for help with bill paying and banking, you have both formal and informal options.

Informal loans could involve your close friend cutting you a check with an informal agreement that you will pay the money back in a set amount of time.

More formal options could include a convenience account that allows you to designate a person to help you with depositing, withdrawing, and writing checks. Alternatively, adding a friend or family member to your account as a trusted contact would notify that person if your bank suspects a financial scam, and granting a person close to you power of attorney would give them the ability to act on your behalf regarding your finances.

Who Is the Best Person to Talk to About Finances?

While there is no “best” person to talk to about finances, some financial experts say that you may find it helpful to consult your friends and family about personal finance questions. Given that these people are deeply familiar with your values and character, they may be able to provide you with more candid and personalized advice than a financial advisor or therapist.

Regardless of who you talk to about your personal finances, you should make an effort to educate yourself on different financial products and services before entering into a conversation. Resources like Investopedia’s Financial Literacy Resource Center, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Endowment for Financial Education provide foundational finance knowledge, so you can know your options and control your money.

The Bottom Line

Friends can be a great resource for personal finance matters. However, it’s essential to recognize the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations when engaging in financial discussions with friends. By openly communicating personal preferences and boundaries, you can foster healthier relationships and avoid potential discomfort or misunderstandings.

Beyond friends, you may want to seek professional guidance from financial advisors and external financial education resources. Ultimately, by navigating financial discussions with friends sensitively, you can strengthen your friendships while enhancing your financial well-being."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,4 Easy Budgeting Techniques,"To create and stick to a budget, it’s helpful to have some tricks up your sleeve. Here are some easy tactics to keep you on track.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112116/four-easy-budgeting-techniques-you-should-master.asp,"For some people, budgeting money comes naturally; they like being organized and tracking data. For others, it’s a bit more challenging. Facts and figures aren’t their forte and constant monitoring is tedious. Even if you fall into the latter category, the process can be made easier with a few quick tricks.

Here are four easy techniques that will make budget planning a breeze.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Dump the receipts. Use an app to track your expenses.
Automate your bill-paying and monthly savings.
Be flexible, but if you constantly bust your budget revise it.
1. Automate Your Tracking

There's no real reason these days to save your receipts in a pile and wade through them later. There are apps for that.

A smartphone app or software program can help you track your budget. These programs often use the same security systems that online banks do, so if you choose a reputable tracker, you should not be concerned with the safety of your information.

The programs will not only track your spending but will help you categorize your purchases, send you alerts when you are nearing your budget limits, and help you set long-term financial goals and keep to them.

2. Automate Your Spending

Automatic bill payment and automatic transfers of money into a checking account can take some of the difficulty out of sticking to a budget.

After all, if you never see the money in your checking account you won’t spend it on things that are not in your budget. Just be sure to keep enough funds in the account to cover your automated expenses so that you aren’t hit with overdraft fees. 

Coordinate Deposits and Withdrawals

One way to avoid this risk is to set all automatic withdrawals to hit at the same time that your paycheck is deposited so that your money goes directly toward the bills and your savings goals at a time that you know you will have sufficient funds in your account.

Some employers will even direct deposit a designated amount into a savings account each pay period while putting the balance into your checking account.

3. Be Flexible

Your budget has to be flexible enough to absorb some of life's nasty little surprises. Inevitably, unforeseen expenses will come up and bust your budget.

It's important to recognize that a budget is a tool that can be adjusted if it isn’t aligning with your spending.

If you go over budget a few times, don’t beat yourself up. Instead, plan for a slightly larger emergency fund as a cushion. If you continually go over, it’s time to reassess your spending. You're paying out more than you can afford and you need to make some adjustments.

4. Consider Your Future

Most people understand the difference between wants and needs when it comes to budgeting. However, many people incorrectly place savings in the optional spending category.

The Bottom Line

Planning for your retirement, building an emergency fund, and saving for long-term goals are all critical for your financial health. They should not be considered optional expenses that can be eliminated when they're inconvenient.

Even if it means forgoing dinner out or cutting the cable bill, saving money needs to be a mandatory part of your budget. You want to be financially prepared to meet your long-term goals, whether you want to buy a house, travel the world, or pay off debts."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,How to Start a Family and Save for Retirement,"To start a family and save for retirement, you’ll need to plan ahead and take advantage of cost reduction strategies, tax benefits, and budgeting techniques.",https://www.investopedia.com/family-and-retirement-8599280,"Starting a family while saving for retirement comes with challenges and benefits. In most cases, time is on your side.

If you start early, you still have plenty of time to grow your retirement savings and benefit from compound interest. And there are a number of tax-advantaged plans out there to help you do so without incurring a huge tax bill.

On the other hand, starting relatively young means you may still be building your career and income. According to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2023” report, the average retirement savings account balance for ages 35–44 is $76,354. For ages 25–34, that number is just $30,017. On top of that, there’s buying a home, a car, and paying for your children’s college and weddings to account for.1

The good news is that with the right tools and strategies, planning for both your family’s needs and your retirement is entirely possible.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Plan ahead and start saving early to balance starting a family with building a successful retirement plan.
Understand common costs for individuals and couples who want to raise children while saving for retirement.
Assess your financial situation, set goals as a family, and create a budget to meet those goals.
Take advantage of cost reduction strategies and tax benefits available to families.
Use tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for retirement.
Costs to Consider

In general, the stereotypical American Dream is becoming more expensive. Take the average cost of raising two children until age 18, estimated at $576,896. The average amount needed to retire is even higher, clocking in at $715,968, according to Investopedia’s recent analysis.

Understanding the various costs you may face is the first step to preparing for them. Couples or individuals who are starting a family should consider the following.

Having a Baby or Adopting

If you’re enrolled in a large group plan, out-of-pocket costs for a hospital birth average $2,854 per child.2 When it comes to adoption, costs vary widely depending on whether you adopt via the public child welfare system, a private agency, independent adoption, or intercountry adoption.

According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adoption from a private agency may cost $30,000 to $60,000.3

Independent or intercountry adoption ranges from $20,000 to $50,000, whereas adopting a child from the welfare system is virtually free. The associated expenses may include home study, court and legal fees, and social work or counseling services.4

Paying for Child Care

Child care has long been a substantial expense for families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deems child care as “affordable” when it costs no more than 7% of a family’s household income.5 Yet many families spend 10% to 24% of household income on child care.6

Child care costs vary by state. For example, the average cost of infant care in Alabama is around $500 per month and $432 each month for a 4-year-old. In California, the average monthly cost of infant care is $1,412, and $956 for a 4-year-old. And in Michigan, you’d pay an average of $905 per month for infant care or $741 per month for a 4-year-old.7

Saving for Higher Education

Putting your kids through college is a major cost, no matter how you slice it. For academic year 2021–22, the average total cost for full-time undergraduate attendance was $32,900 at a private for-profit institution and $55,800 at a private nonprofit institution. Meanwhile, public institutions had an average total cost of $26,000.8

These amounts represent the sum of tuition and required fees, books, supplies, and the average cost of room and board for students living on campus at four-year institutions.

Keep in mind that this amount doesn’t reflect the various types of financial aid that students may receive.

Assess Your Financial Situation

Evaluating your current financial situation is a crucial step toward reaching your personal financial goals. A thorough assessment of your income, expenses, and savings potential will provide valuable insights into your overall financial health and areas for improvement.

Here are key aspects to consider when assessing your finances:

Income

Calculate your gross annual income by adding up all sources of earnings, such as wages, salaries, self-employment profits, interest, dividends, and rental income. Be sure to account for any changes in employment status, promotions, or new job opportunities throughout the year.

Expenses

Create a detailed list of all ongoing and ad hoc expenses, categorizing them accordingly. Common categories include housing, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, healthcare, debt payments, entertainment, subscriptions, and miscellaneous expenses.

To get a clear picture of your spending habits, track your expenses over several months by using budgeting tools like spreadsheets, mobile apps, or online resources provided by banks and credit unions.

Savings Potential

Determine your disposable income by calculating the amount left from your income after paying taxes and necessary expenses. Then, evaluate whether you have enough funds available for emergency savings, retirement planning, investments, and discretionary spending.

Establish Family Priorities

With an understanding of the costs involved and a clear picture of your financial situation, you can begin to prioritize and outline future goals—both for your family and your retirement. Specific goals will depend on you, your partner, and your financial situation. But the following are a good place to start:

Start or Grow Your Emergency Fund 

If an unexpected car repair, pet expense, or medical emergency suddenly popped up, would you have enough cash to cover it? What if you got laid off next month?

If you aren’t prepared, an unexpected expense could derail your savings plans. That's why financial experts always recommend having an emergency fund to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses.9 If you’re self-employed or your income is unpredictable, you’ll want to save even more.

Having a safety net set aside keeps you from having to use credit cards or dipping into your retirement savings. The best place for an emergency fund is a liquid and thus easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings or other interest-earning account.


Put Retirement First

When setting financial goals, it’s natural for parents to want to put their children first. But financial planners recommend prioritizing your own retirement over saving for a child’s education.

While students have access to loans, grants, and scholarships, there are no such resources for parents. Saving for retirement falls largely on the individual—with some help from your employer if you’re lucky.

So, contribute as much as you can to your retirement savings accounts, and take advantage of any 401(k) or Health Savings Account (HSA) matching programs that your company offers.

Plan Ahead for Education Savings 

Once you hit your retirement savings goals, the next step is saving for your kids’ college tuition. A 529 plan is a great way to do this, since it’s specifically designed to help pay for higher education.

This tax-advantaged account allows contributions to grow federal income tax-deferred, with tax-free withdrawals for qualified higher education expenses (such as tuition and room and board).10

Establish Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Goals for Your Family 

For families who may feel overwhelmed by competing financial goals—like buying a home, saving for a child's education, or retirement—Mike Kojonen, founder of Principal Preservation Services, recommends setting goal milestones.

“For example, rather than seeing retirement as a distant, abstract aim, break it down into actionable steps like increasing retirement contributions annually or setting up a dedicated college savings fund for their children,” he says.

These targets can be broken down into specific short-, medium-, and long-term financial objectives for your family. For instance, building an emergency fund, contributing to employer-matched retirement plans, and establishing a consistent saving habit might serve as short-term goals.

Long-term goals often include caring for aging parents or, if your children are young, saving for their college education. Medium-term goals (say, five years) could include a family vacation, buying a new car, or remodeling your home.

Consider having a conversation with family members or a financial advisor to help outline these priorities and get on the same page.

Mark Damsgaard, head of client advisory at Global Residence Index, also recommends that couples discuss whether they’ll keep some assets separate or share all assets.

“It’s not wrong to not share the entirety of your assets, especially if you worked hard for them on your own. And then you may talk about having joint accounts for the earnings and assets you acquire when you enter your marriage or partnership,” Damsgaard says.


Revisit Your Budget

Achieving financial goals is often easier when you have a budget to give structure and clarity to your spending habits. A budget works best when it’s based on the specifics of your situation.

Use what you’ve learned about known costs for major goals like family and retirement, your financial situation, and your long- and short-term goals to set a realistic budget. Compare the following common budgeting models to see what works best for you.

50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% of income to needs (such as housing, food, and utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, and hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment (including retirement savings). While it may not work for everyone, this rule is popular because of its simplicity.

Progressive Budgeting

With progressive budgeting, you gradually increase savings and retirement contributions as your income grows or your family’s financial situation improves. Progressive budgeting is particularly useful in working against lifestyle creep, a common phenomenon that can eat into your retirement and family savings if you aren’t careful.

Pay Yourself First

Pay yourself first is exactly what it sounds like. You set aside money from your income for debt payments and savings, including retirement contributions, before taking care of other bills.

Of course, you still need to account for rent and other ongoing expenses. But this method, sometimes called reverse budgeting, makes it easy to prioritize savings goals. For example, you could set up automatic transfers or contributions to retirement accounts before allocating money for other uses.


Tips for Balancing Saving for a Family and Retirement

Reducing costs and maximizing tax benefits mean more money that you can put toward retirement or family goals.

See Where You Can Reduce Costs 

Lowering your child care bill can amount to major savings. Consider enlisting help from neighbors and family members or arranging child care swaps with other parents. Some states also offer government-funded assistance programs to help families pay for child care.

Government resources include Head Start and Early Head Start programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, military child care financial assistance programs, and government vouchers or subsidies. You should also see if your employer offers a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA).

To save money beyond child care costs, look into other possibilities like:

Mortgage refinancing to reduce your monthly payment
Adjusting your thermostat or using energy-efficient bulbs to save on utility bills
Carpooling, using public transportation, or walking/cycling to trim transportation costs
Cutting food costs by cooking at home, buying store brands, and planning meals ahead of time

Maximize Tax Benefits 

There are tax benefits designed to help families save money, including:

Child Tax Credit (CTC): The CTC provides a tax credit of up to $2,000 per qualifying child under the age of 17. For 2024, up to $1,700 of the tax credit may be refundable, depending on your tax situation.11
Child and Dependent Care Credit: This credit covers expenses for child care services, such as babysitting, daycare, or preschool, for children under age 13 or disabled spouses or parents. The credit ranges from 20% to 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents.12
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Low- and moderate-income working families can benefit from the EITC, which reduces the amount of tax owed and may result in a tax refund. The credit is based on a percentage of earned income, with higher income phaseouts for taxpayers with children.13
Credit for Other Dependents: This is available to taxpayers with a dependent who doesn’t qualify for the Child Tax Credit, such as children age 17 or older, qualifying relatives, or dependent parents.14
Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction: This permits self-employed parents to deduct 100% of the cost of health insurance premiums paid for family members, including children under age 27.15

Take Advantage of Retirement Savings Options

Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts to maximize savings and growth.

401(k) Plans: Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary toward retirement savings, often with employer matching contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Traditional IRAs are personal retirement accounts that provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA: SEP and SIMPLE IRAs let small business owners and self-employed individuals save for retirement while receiving tax benefits.16
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): For families or individuals with a high-deductible health plan, HSAs offer flexible options for saving money on healthcare or boosting retirement savings.17

How Much Should I Save Monthly for Retirement?

The amount you should save monthly for retirement will vary based on your income, age, and retirement goals. Financial experts recommend saving at least 10% to 15% of your income for retirement—including your employer match, if you have one. If possible, bumping that up to 20% of your income can help you save significantly more over time. This is especially helpful if you’ve started later on saving for retirement.18

What Are the Best Retirement Savings Options for Families?

You can use a number of strategies to help you save for retirement, including tax-advantaged retirement accounts like traditional or Roth 401(k)s and IRAs, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs (if you’re self-employed), HSAs, or other investment accounts. For parents who want to start putting money away for their children, custodial IRAs offer tax-advantaged savings.

The best retirement plan to build your nest egg will depend on your financial situation, your goals for retirement, and other factors. Understand the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, and tax rules surrounding accounts to help you make the best decision. You may want to consult a financial advisor.


What Is the 5% Rule for Retirement Savings?

The 5% rule is a frequently used rule of thumb for calculating how much you can withdraw from retirement savings each year without running out of money. A modified version of the traditional 4% rule, the 5% rule allows for a higher annual withdrawal rate, which may work for long-term investors with diversified portfolios.1920 Work with a financial advisor to assess whether the 5% withdrawal rate aligns with your retirement objectives, investment strategy, and overall financial plan.

The Bottom Line

Armed with knowledge about your goals, potential costs, financial situation, and available tools for investing, you can achieve a comfortable retirement while also growing a family. Start early and contribute consistently to retirement savings in order to maximize your savings and growth potential. If needed, seek professional financial advice to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning and evaluate the best decisions based on your specific situation."

snowball method debt repayment success rate,investopedia,"Debt Avalanche: Meaning, Pros and Cons, and Example",A debt avalanche is an accelerated system of paying down debt that is based on paying the loan with the highest interest rate first. Learn how to use the debt avalanche.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp,"What Is a Debt Avalanche?

A debt avalanche is a type of accelerated debt repayment plan. Essentially, a debtor allocates enough money to make the minimum payment on each source of debt, then devotes any remaining repayment funds to the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the debt avalanche approach, once the debt with the highest interest rate is entirely paid off, then the extra repayment funds go toward the next highest interest-bearing loan. This process continues until all the debts are paid off.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The debt avalanche is a systematic way of paying down debt to save money on interest.
Individuals who use the debt avalanche strategy make the minimum payment on each debt, then use any remaining available funds to pay the debt with the highest interest rates.
A debt avalanche is different from a debt snowball, which is when a borrower pays down the smallest debt first.
How Debt Avalanches Work

Paying off your debts can be a daunting task, especially when you're faced with multiple debts, high balances, and sky-high interest rates. Making only the minimum monthly payments each month can make the process seem even more overwhelming, as the majority of your payments go toward interest rather than the principal balance.

This is why it's important to have a strategy in place that will help you become debt-free. Using the debt avalanche strategy is just one possibility. This tactic allows you to concentrate on the debts with the highest rates first. You can then target the one with the second-highest rate until you're left with the one that charges the lowest rate.

The debt avalanche allows you to focus on lowering the debt you have by paying less interest over time. Here's how you should structure the strategy:

The first step in starting a debt avalanche strategy is to make a list of all the debts you owe along with the individual interest rate for each.
Next, designate an amount of your available monthly income to pay debts. This amount should come from any funds not currently obligated for living and household expenses like rent, grocery, daycare, or transportation. 
Make a lump-sum payment (above the minimum required payment) to the debt with the highest interest rate. Ensure that the payment is significant but within your means.
Continue making minimum payments on your other obligations until the highest debt is paid off.
Move on to the debt with the next highest interest rate until all your debts are clear.

This strategy takes time, so it's important to be patient and not lose your focus.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

There are benefits and drawbacks that you must weigh out before you begin tackling your debts using this strategy. We've highlighted some of the key pros and cons of using a debt avalanche strategy to pay off your debts below.

Advantages of Debt Avalanches

The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it reduces the total interest you pay in the long term. Interest adds to your debts because most lenders use compound interest. The accrual rate depends on the frequency of compounding—the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest.

A debt avalanche repayment strategy also reduces the amount of time it will take you to get out of debt—assuming you make consistent payments—because less interest accumulates.


If you find yourself overburdened with debt, consider speaking to a financial professional or an organization that specializes in debt relief. Investopedia has a list of debt relief companies that may be able to help you out.

Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

One of the main disadvantages of using the debt avalanche as a repayment strategy is that it only targets interest rates rather than balances. As such, you may not necessarily put a dent in the debt with the highest balance as it only receives the minimum payment. This can be daunting and cause you to feel like you're not making any progress.

The debt avalanche method requires discipline for consistency, which can be a downside for some people. Even with the best intentions of sticking with the debt-avalanche system, you may revert to making minimum payments on all the debts, especially if your financial situation changes. That’s why most financial planners recommend to first save up a six-month emergency fund before attempting any accelerated debt payoff plan.


Pros

Reduces total interest paid

Less time spent getting out of debt

Cons

Targets interest rates rather than (high) balances

Requires discipline and consistency

Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

The debt avalanche is different from the debt snowball. This is another accelerated debt payoff plan that requires a focused, dedicated approach.

With the debt snowball strategy, the debtor uses money beyond the minimum payments to pay off debts with the lowest balance first before moving on to the one(s) with the largest outstanding balance.

This means that you'll pay more than the minimum payment on the debt with the lowest balance until it's paid in full. You'll then move on to the next smallest debt until you eventually reach the one with the highest balance. As with the debt avalanche, you must continue making the minimum payments on the other debts as you paid down the smallest one in the bunch.

Although the debt snowball method doesn't save as much as the debt avalanche in terms of total interest charges, it can be a better strategy for staying motivated by eliminating small debts more quickly.

Most credit card balances compound interest daily, but there are loans where the interest can compound monthly, semiannually, or annually.

Example of a Debt Avalanche

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a debt avalanche works. Let's imagine you have $500 available every month (after you factor in your living expenses) to put toward paying down your debt. Say your current loans include:

$1,000 on a credit card with a 26% annual percentage rate (APR)
$1,250 on a personal loan with a 12% APR
$5,000 line of credit (LOC) with an 8% interest rate

For simplicity’s sake, assume each debt has a minimum monthly payment of $50. You would need to allot $150 toward paying each loan's minimum monthly payment ($50 x 3). The remaining $350 would also be put toward your credit card, the highest-interest debt. After the credit card balance is cleared, you would put the extra money toward the personal loan until it's paid off. Finally, you would put all $500 toward your line of credit, which has the smallest interest rate.

What Is the Difference Between the Debt Avalanche and the Debt Snowball?

The debt avalanche method involves paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. With the debt snowball method, you focus on putting your extra money toward your smallest debt first. The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it saves more in interest in the long term, while the benefit of the debt snowball method is that it can be more motivating.

What Is the Disadvantage of Debt Avalanche?

The major disadvantage of the debt avalanche method can be seen in cases where your highest-interest debt is also your largest debt. If you start putting your extra money toward paying down this debt first, you may save money on interest, but you may not feel like you're making strides toward paying down the loan.

What Is an Example of Debt Avalanche?

For this example of a debt avalanche, say you have three credit cards and are carrying balances on each. The first credit card has a $600 balance with an APR of 24%, the second has a $1,000 balance with an APR of 26%, and the third has a $1,200 balance with an APR of 19%. Using this method, you would first pay down the second credit card because it has the highest interest rate.

The Bottom Line

Whether the debt avalanche or the debt snowball method is the best strategy for paying off debt will depend on your financial situation. Using the debt avalanche method will save you the most money in interest in the long term, but some people find more success with the debt snowball method, which can be more motivating because you'll pay off smaller debts sooner.

If you're dealing with too much debt and considering debt settlement, Pacific Debt Relief may be able to help. It has stellar customer reviews, but you must have at least $10,000 of debt, so it may not be a good fit if you're struggling to manage a smaller balance.

Excellent customer reviews: Pacific Debt Relief has excellent reviews from clients on both Trustpilot (4.8/5 stars) and the Better Business Bureau (4.93/5).

2
 Many debt settlement companies have lower ratings, so its strong customer support makes Pacific Debt Relief stand out from competitors.
Charges fees based on settled debt: Unlike some other debt settlement companies, Pacific charges fees based on the percentage of settled debt, rather than the initial debt you start the program with. This can save you money compared to a company that charges based on the initial debt (which is a larger amount).
Cons
Not available in all states: Pacific Debt Relief only serves residents in 29 states and the District of Columbia. It serves residents in the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
Higher-than-usual debt minimum: To qualify for debt settlement with Pacific Debt Relief, you must have $10,000 or more in unsecured debt. Some other companies have lower debt minimums.
Does not offer other services: As a debt settlement company, Pacific Debt Relief doesn't help with other areas of finance. For example, if you want to meet with a counselor to discuss budgeting, take homeownership classes, or attend workshops on building credit, you'll need to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency instead.
How Pacific Debt Relief Works

Pacific Debt Relief specializes in debt settlement. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to settle an outstanding debt for less than is owed. Debt settlement companies negotiate with creditors on behalf of their clients.

Depending on your situation and your creditors, debt settlement could slash your outstanding debt by a significant amount. 

As with other debt settlement companies, there are no upfront fees. Pacific Debt Relief only makes money once it has negotiated a settlement and the first settlement payment is made. 

 

Debt settlement can be risky. The fees can be expensive, there's no guarantee your creditors will agree to settle the outstanding debt, and the process can significantly damage your credit.

Accreditations

Pacific Debt Relief is accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI). The International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA) also certifies it.

How to Enroll With Pacific Debt Relief

To get started with Pacific Debt Relief, follow these steps.

Set up a free consultation: Contact customer support via phone or email to arrange a free debt consultation. The representative will review your outstanding debt and finances to determine if you're a good candidate for a debt settlement agreement. 
Sign the agreement: Review the agreement, paying particular attention to the monthly amount you have to deposit in a savings account to build a settlement fund and the fees you'll have to pay Pacific Debt Relief if it successfully negotiates a settlement. If you agree to the terms, sign and return the agreement.
Pay the monthly amount: You’ll have to stop making your existing creditor payments. Instead, pay the agreed monthly amount into the dedicated debt settlement savings account. Pacific Debt Relief will begin negotiations for debt settlement once the account has grown large enough to entice creditors with a lump-sum payoff.
Types of Debt Addressed

Pacific Debt Relief provides debt settlement services for unsecured debt, like credit card balances. Other forms of debt, such as secured debt like mortgages or car loans, aren't eligible for debt settlement.

The following types of debt qualify for Pacific Debt Relief's program.

Unsecured Loans

Unsecured loans, such as personal loans, can qualify for debt settlement since they don't have collateral. 

Credit Card Debt

Credit card balances, including the balances on retail cards, are eligible for debt settlement.

Medical Bills

Outstanding medical bills from hospitals or clinics are usually eligible for debt settlement, as long as they aren't backed by collateral.

Expected Cost

Fees vary based on your enrolled debt and state of registration, but you can expect to pay 15% to 25% of your settled debt. This fee is factored into your monthly payment amount.

 

Debt settlement companies like Pacific Debt Relief cannot legally charge you any fees before they settle your debt.
4

Expected Relief Amount

Pacific Debt Relief cannot guarantee results, nor can any other debt settlement company. But Pacific claims it can help customers reduce up to 50% of their credit card debt. The amount you save depends on your balances owed, the money in your settlement account, and the willingness of your creditors to accept a settlement.

Expected Time to Complete the Program

According to Pacific Debt Relief, its clients typically complete the program within 24 to 48 months. The program timeline depends on your enrolled balances and how much you can set aside each month for a settlement fund.

Additional Services

Pacific Debt Relief only provides debt settlement services. If you don't meet its criteria for debt settlement, it may refer you to other companies, such as debt consolidation or credit repair firms.

 

If you pursue debt settlement, your creditors can still send your account to collections. You could be sued and, if the company wins, your wages could be garnished.

Client Dashboard

When you enroll in a debt settlement program with Pacific Debt Relief, the company will set you up with an account on its client portal. This will help you track your progress (like the amount of money in your settlement account) as Pacific Debt Relief negotiates on your behalf.

Is Debt Settlement Worth It? 

Debt settlement can be expensive, and it can significantly damage your credit. Whether it's worth the drawbacks depends on the type of debt you have, your balance, and the settlement Pacific Debt Relief can negotiate.

The company claims it can reduce your balance by as much as 50%, but there is no guarantee of success. Before contacting Pacific Debt Relief or another company, consider other debt relief options. Depending on your situation, a debt management plan through credit counseling, a repayment strategy like the debt snowball or avalanche, or even bankruptcy may be a better choice. 

Is Debt Relief Through Debt Settlement Taxable?

Yes, debt relief through debt settlement is taxable. If Pacific Debt Relief is successful in negotiating your debt to be repaid to an amount less than you owe, you won't only have to pay the company a fee. You also need to plan for taxes: Canceled or settled debt is taxable as income, and it needs to be reported on your tax return.

The Bottom Line

Pacific Debt Relief may be effective in negotiating a settlement for your outstanding credit card balances or other unsecured debt. But be aware: The company's fees are typically 15% to 25% of your settled debt, and your credit score could decrease drastically during the process. 

Debt settlement should be considered only after weighing the advantages and drawbacks of other approaches.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is Pacific Debt Relief Legit?

Pacific Debt Relief is a legitimate company based out of San Diego. The debt relief firm has been in business since 2002, is accredited by the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators, and has been accredited by the Better Business Bureau since 2010.

How Much Does Pacific Debt Relief Cost?

Pacific Debt Relief charges 15% to 25% of a customer's initial debt, which is typical for the debt relief industry. The company’s fees are paid only after a settlement has been successfully reached and paid.

Does Pacific Debt Relief Hurt Your Credit?

With Pacific Debt Relief, as with any debt settlement company, you must stop making any payments to your creditors while the company negotiates on your behalf. Your creditors will report missed payments to credit bureaus. Those late payments and delinquent accounts can significantly harm your credit score, although the money you save through debt settlement may be worth the price.

Who Is Eligible for Pacific Debt Relief?

To qualify for Pacific Debt Relief's debt settlement program, you must live in one of the states it operates in and have at least $10,000 of outstanding debt. Pacific Debt Relief only works with unsecured debt, like credit cards and personal signature loans; secured debts, such as car loans, aren't eligible. 

How We Determine the Best Debt Relief Companies

To determine the best debt relief companies, we reviewed various databases, competitive analyses, consumer behavior, and more, ultimately narrowing down the list to 40 companies that offered debt settlement and/or credit counseling services. We developed a quantitative model in which we identified 53 important criteria across five categories. We weighted each category as follows for this article:

Costs and fees: 41.00%
Availability: 22.50%
Reputation and stability: 19.00%
Customer experience: 9.50%
Services: 8.00%

We then gathered data for the 53 criteria directly from companies via websites, media contacts, and existing partnerships. Data was collected between Oct. 19, 2023 and Dec. 18, 2023. This resulted in over 2,000 data points in our rubric, which we used to score and determine the best debt relief companies (including debt settlement and credit counseling services) for people looking to manage and get out of debt.

Investopedia / Zoe Hansen

The term “debt relief” often refers to debt settlement companies, but it’s also used as an umbrella term to describe just about anything meant to help ease the financial strain from debt. Many types of loans have specific debt relief options, such as recasting a mortgage or the different income-driven payment plans available for federal student loans. When it comes to anything other than simple unsecured debt (like personal loans and credit cards), it’s best to research the specific debt and contact your lender for assistance. 

Costs of Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?
2

Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.

Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.

Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:

Settlement fees: These fees range from 14% to 30% of your debt, but they’re only paid on debts that the company successfully negotiates. Some debt settlement companies base this fee on the amount of settled debt, while others base it on the amount of enrolled debt (again, only concerning accounts that are settled; if the company can’t negotiate one of your debts, you wouldn’t pay fees for that debt).
Monthly account fees: You may be charged a setup and/or monthly fee for the third-party savings account that debt settlement companies require you to use to build up your lump sum payment.

More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:

Income taxes: You’ll generally be required to pay taxes on the amount of debt your creditors forgive when you file your taxes at the end of the year.
3
 Depending on your tax bracket, that could amount to 10% to 37% (in 2024) of the amount that your creditors forgave.
4
Credit damage: Creditors will report late payments, defaults, collections, and debt settlements on your credit reports, which can cause serious damage to your credit. A closed, delinquent account will generally stay on your credit reports for seven years.
5
Late payment fees: Creditors will charge late payment fees, which can cause the amount you owe to increase while you’re not making payments on your debt. These fees add to your balance and can be included in settlements, but if the debt settlement company isn’t successful, you’ll owe all those extra fees, too.
Unsuccessful debt settlement: Although old, one 2007 Federal Trade Commission analysis found that only about half of people successfully completed a debt relief and settlement program.
6
 People who don’t complete the program can end up with worse credit and in more debt than they started with.

If you’re considering debt settlement, it’s important to work with a trustworthy company that doesn’t charge extra-high fees. See the best debt relief companies to explore our top picks.

Costs of Credit Counseling

Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.

Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.
7

Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.
8
 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:

Debt management plan setup fee: $0 to $99
Debt management plan monthly fee: $0 to $75

You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.

Costs of Debt Consolidation/Refinance

Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.

Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.

If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.

Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:

Loan interest: Loans charge interest from the start, albeit at a lower overall rate on average than credit cards (unless you get a 0% APR credit card).
9
Origination fees: Loans often come with origination fees ranging from 1% to 6% or more, especially if you don’t have good or excellent credit.

And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:

Annual fees: Balance transfer cards may come with annual fees, which are sometimes waived in the first year. The best cards don’t charge such a fee, however.
Balance transfer fees: Most balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically ranging from 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
Credit card interest: A 0% APR balance transfer card will start charging interest at the end of the 0% intro period, giving you a good incentive to pay down as much as you can during the interim. It’s also possible to lose your 0% rate if you miss a payment. And, if you make any purchases with the card, that spending will accrue interest at the purchase APR (which may or may not be 0%).

The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 

If you don’t qualify for a 0% APR balance transfer, you may still be able to transfer a balance to a credit card—but it probably won’t be a cost-saving move, because normal credit card rates tend to be relatively high.

Costs of Debt Payoff Apps

Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.

Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.

Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.

App	How It Works	Cost
Undebt.it	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $12/year for premium subscription
Debt Payoff Planner	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $2/month for premium subscription

Debt Payoff Assistant	Very basic debt snowball planning tool	Free
Costs of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.
10

After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:

Court costs: You’ll typically need to pay over $300 to file various documents with your local bankruptcy court (fee waivers or installment payments are sometimes accepted).
Attorney fees: Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,000—or more—to hire an attorney.
Credit counseling/debtor education course fees: Those who file bankruptcy must enroll in credit counseling and debtor education courses. The price for each course is capped at $50, although you’ll often pay less than half of that.
1

Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
11
 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:

Credit damage: Bankruptcy stays on your credit reports for up to 10 years.
12
 During that period, it may be difficult for you to get approved for credit, utilities, and even rental housing. The severity of the negative effects decreases over time, however.
Social stigma: People who file for bankruptcy may be treated poorly by others, even if the debt wasn’t their fault in the first place.

Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.

If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”

Don’t forget to look up free legal aid clinics and support available in your area, especially if you’re on a limited income or from an underserved community.

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 

“There are debt relief options for just about anyone who owes money,” said Tayne. “Generally, though, once you know there’s an issue with keeping up on payments, that’s the best time to look for a debt relief option.”

It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.

Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:

Starting (or refining) a budget
Asking for help from family and friends
Cutting expenses and increasing income

The average household was $23,317 in the red, excluding mortgage debt, in the second quarter of 2023.
13
 That kind of debt can add unhealthy stress to your life, making it harder to make ends meet and get ahead in life.

The Bottom Line

You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 

Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. 

Do Debt Relief Companies Charge a Fee?

Generally, yes; most types of debt relief companies charge some type of fee, although some options are free. Here’s a quick rundown of the costs you can expect, according to Investopedia research:

Debt settlement companies: Typically 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Certain services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and for balance transfer cards, balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, with much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more
1
How Does Debt Relief Affect Your Credit?

Different debt relief methods have different effects on your credit. Debt payoff apps, credit counseling, and debt management plans don’t have any direct impact on your credit score.
14
 At the other end of the extreme, bankruptcy and debt settlement have the potential to cause severe damage to your credit that can take years to overcome.

How Long Does Debt Relief Last?

Depending on the type of debt relief program you choose, it could be very quick or take a long time. If you’re just looking for help in making your payments, consolidating your high-interest debt into one personal loan can sometimes be completed in a day. On the other hand, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan can take up to five years to complete.
12

Is Debt Relief Worth It?

“In general, if you take the time to research your options and choose a reputable organization or professional, the initial costs will be transparent from the get-go and well worth the savings and relief you get as a result,” said Tayne. To ensure you’re happy with your decision, it’s important to compare all your options and research the full range of costs, including indirect ones such as taxes owed on settled debt. 

How Much Debt Is Too Much?

If you’re having trouble making your monthly payments, you have too much debt. A more specific number to keep in mind, especially for would-be homebuyers, is a debt-to-income ratio of 43%; above this mark, most lenders won’t approve you for a conventional mortgage.
15
 Some debt-averse people are more concerned about the total amount of their debt. By paying down their debt faster they may be able to sleep better at night, even if their monthly payments are currently manageable. "

Building generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and opportunities for your children, grandchildren, and beyond.

Generational wealth is about more than just financial resources, according to Taylor Kovar, certified financial planner (CFP) and CEO of 11 Financial in Lufkin, Texas. “Its value extends beyond the monetary aspect—it’s also about imparting enduring family values and wisdom, creating a legacy that benefits and shapes the lives of future generations,” he said.

Learn more about why generational wealth is important, how to lay the foundations to build wealth for your family, and how to ensure that your legacy is passed on in the most efficient way.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generational wealth refers to passing down assets from one generation to the next.
Before you can build generational wealth, you must create a strong financial foundation by prioritizing savings, growing an emergency fund, and thinking through future plans.
Generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and open opportunities for your children and beyond.
Strategies for building generational wealth include investing in education, financial markets, and real estate, and creating and preserving assets.
Maximizing tax benefits and avoiding debt are crucial for building generational wealth.
The Importance of Building Generational Wealth

Achieving financial success takes a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and planning. Not only can it help you enjoy things in your lifetime, but it can also help your heirs reap the benefits of your legacy and enjoy a financially secure lifestyle after you’re gone.

Think of it as a wealth snowball. For example, generational wealth paves the way for enhanced educational opportunities and, consequently, greater earning potential for your kids, according to Kovar. And then they can continue building upon that foundation for their kids (your grandkids).

The Challenges of Building Generational Wealth 

Building generational wealth is not an easy undertaking, but it’s especially challenging if you grow up in poverty or face systemic barriers. Unfortunately, that has been the experience of many marginalized groups in this country.

For instance, in 2019, the median wealth of White families was 6.5 times that of Black families, 5.5 times that of Hispanic families, and 2.7 times that of Asian and other families, according to the Congressional Budget Office.1

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, data from the St. Louis Fed showed that Black families owned about 23 cents for every $1 of White family wealth, on average. Hispanic families owned about 19 cents for every $1 of White family wealth.2 

Contributing to this racial wealth gap is the fact that Black Americans are less likely to own a home, which is one of the major ways that people pass on wealth.3 The underlying reason for this is, in part, systemic discriminatory practices in home selling, home lending, and appraisals that have been well-documented in recent decades.

Black Americans and other marginalized groups have also historically had less access to banking and financial services and lower credit scores, which has locked them out of various investment opportunities.

If building generational wealth is a goal of yours, there are a few financial moves you can make that can help you achieve this.

Build a Strong Financial Foundation

Building generational wealth is as much about setting a strong example as it is about making the right financial decisions. You can model the building blocks of healthy personal finances to your family, which includes the following best practices.

Prioritize Savings

“It’s not how much you make, but how much you keep. That’s the key to accumulating savings and wealth,” says J.B. Beckett, founder of Beckett Financial Group in West Columbia, South Carolina.

Many people fall into the trap of saying they’ll save what’s left over at the end of the month but never end up getting around to it, or they spend beyond their means. A better approach is to create a budget to control your spending so that you have guaranteed funds available to save and set up an automatic payment to yourself each month.

Here’s how to get started:

Pick a percentage or dollar amount that you are able to allocate toward savings goals after your expenses are covered.
If you have more than one savings goal, create separate accounts for each one.
Consider a high-yield savings account that earns interest on top of your contributions.
Set up automatic payments to each savings account and watch them grow.

For longer-term savings goals, you might consider putting money in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts for a guaranteed return.

Build an Emergency Fund

One of the most important tools for building generational wealth is making sure that you have financial security in case of an emergency or loss of income. That’s where an emergency fund comes in.

Oftentimes, not having an emergency fund is what leads people into debt or causes them to cash out retirement accounts, which not only incurs penalties but also comes with a big opportunity cost.

Ultimately, you want to end up with enough money saved to cover a few months’ worth of expenses, but that will take some time to build up. In the interim, focus on making regular, automated contributions, and save more aggressively if you find ways to trim expenses or develop new income streams. Most important is that you avoid the temptation to withdraw money from the account—it must be reserved for true emergencies.

Involve Kids in Money Conversations

One often-overlooked aspect of building a strong financial foundation is involving your family, and children specifically, in the conversation. This way, they can understand financial basics from a young age, alongside you.

Kevin M. Curley II, certified financial planner and financial advisor at Global Wealth Advisors in Dallas, Texas, recommends including children in the family finances from a young age through fun and games.

“Play Monopoly and teach them poker at the kitchen table,” Curley says. “Consider giving them an allowance and discuss how they plan to spend it. Later, let them invest a small amount in their favorite video game designer or cosmetics manufacturer and track wins and losses together.”

Invest in Education

Once you’ve made some progress on your emergency fund, you can allocate some of your discretionary income toward other big financial goals. A popular one is to save for your children’s education. If you’re aiming to build generational wealth, you can think of college savings for your kids as an investment in their future earning power.

That’s because degree attainment is directly correlated with an increase in lifetime earnings—in the millions, as a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found. According to the study, someone with a high school diploma can expect to earn $1.3 million over a lifetime; a bachelor’s degree holder will earn $2.3 million; a master’s degree can lead to $2.7 million in lifetime earnings; and a professional degree holder can earn $3.6 million.4

Note

Of course, the costs of education are continuing to rise, and it may not be the best option for everyone. It’s best to take a comprehensive look at your financial situation and life goals before deciding to invest in education.

Consider opening a 529 plan, which is a tax-advantaged account that is tax-free when used for eligible educational expenses.5 

Invest in Financial Markets

To build wealth in a meaningful way, the sooner you get started, the better. “Starting early and consistently saving, even in smaller amounts, can lead to significant growth over time, thanks to the power of compound interest,” Kovar says.

While investing in the stock market comes with some risk, if you diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, you can balance risk with growth potential. One popular strategy for beginners is to invest in index funds, which is a collection of many stocks designed to mimic the performance of major market indexes like the S&P 500.

The key to investing in the stock market is to think of it in the long term by riding out the downturns since, historically, it usually bounces back.

Invest in Real Estate

Another popular investment avenue to explore is real estate, thanks to its potential rental income and appreciation in property value. Plus, it’s a strong investment to pass on to your next of kin.

“Exploring various property types, from residential to commercial, can diversify your real estate portfolio,” Kovar says.

If you’re not ready for that level of investment or don’t want the commitment of running a property, Beckett suggests looking into real estate investment trusts (REITs).

Create and Preserve Assets

Building wealth is just step one in creating generational wealth. The next part is making sure that your assets are protected so that they remain available to pass on to future generations. You also want your heirs to be able to retain as much of their inheritance (if relevant) as possible, which is why tax implications come into play.

To ensure your children are protected and set up in the best possible way financially, consider the following actions.

Build an Estate Plan

As your assets grow and become more complex, working with financial professionals and attorneys on estate planning is the smart move. Some considerations include:

Creating a business that you can pass down 
Considering life insurance. “Life insurance is one of the most tax-efficient vehicles to pass on wealth,” Beckett says.
Making sure other insurance needs are met. Make sure you’re covered in case of a catastrophic event involving your home, car, or a medical event. If not, one incident or lawsuit could wipe out your savings.
Maximize Tax Benefits

A number of tax-efficient investing strategies and vehicles can help you retain a greater share of your returns. Some strategies include:

Tax-deferred accounts: Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, offering you an upfront tax break as you invest. You pay taxes when you withdraw your money in retirement.67
Tax-exempt accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are tax-exempt when you withdraw, since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.8
Health savings accounts (HSAs): You contribute tax-free and enjoy tax-free growth. Then, if used for eligible medical expenses, money comes out tax-free, too.9

Work with a tax accountant or financial advisor to learn what strategies are best for you, and ultimately shield the most money from taxes as possible.

Avoid Debt and Financial Pitfalls

Living within your means and having a healthy emergency fund are the two best ways to avoid unnecessary, high-interest debt like high credit card balances. Those types of borrowing costs can prevent you from making progress on your savings and wealth-building goals.

If you do have some debt to contend with, prioritize paying your highest-interest accounts, while still maintaining your contributions to your emergency fund and retirement accounts (though it’s OK to scale back temporarily). Try to use any windfalls of money such as tax returns or monetary gifts to pay off large chunks when those opportunities become available. 

How to Pass Down Generational Wealth

The last aspect of generational wealth is making sure it goes where you want it to go. This involves getting your wishes documented legally. At a very basic level, you can start with a will. But as finances get more complex, you’ll want to go beyond that, according to Curley.

Beckett recommends setting up a trust. “A trust can be efficient for bypassing probate if it’s set up properly,” he says. “And it’s private. If it’s in a trust, it’s not public record.”

Once you have your affairs in order, keep the lines of communication open with your family, letting them know your plans and how to access your documents. This is beneficial on the off chance that a sudden emergency happens and your family needs to take over the financial plans.

How Can I Start Building Generational Wealth If I Have Limited Financial Resources?

Take it one small step at a time. Create a budget that allows you to allocate money toward savings each month. Make lifestyle choices that help fuel your financial goals. And invest in your retirement as early as possible to give it time to grow.

What Are Some Tax-Efficient Strategies for Maximizing Generational Wealth?

There are many tax-efficient strategies that you may consider adopting, such as investing in tax-deferred accounts or Health Savings Accounts. The route you choose to go will depend on your own personal financial situation, so you may want to work with a tax professional or financial advisor. Plus, these individuals can help you stay current with any new tax rules as they are established.

How Can I Protect My Assets and Ensure They Are Passed Down to Future Generations?

Making sure you’re properly insured (through home, auto, and life insurance) and working with an estate planner are the two best ways to protect your assets. In addition, be sure you at least have a will, and consider establishing a trust.

The Bottom Line

If you’re a first-generation wealth builder, committing to taking those first steps of saving money, building an emergency fund, and starting to invest for the long term and following through with consistency will eventually pay off.

Though it might take some sacrifice upfront, building generational wealth has both short- and long-term benefits that make it worth the effort. In your lifetime, you’ll get to enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that your loved ones will be well taken care of financially. You can also share your knowledge and insights with your children and grandchildren to help instill strong financial habits that can help them keep the family legacy strong for the next generation."

These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).

Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:
1

Credit card balances: Up by $27 billion
Auto loans: Up by $10 billion
Consumer loans and store cards: Up by $1 billion
Total non-housing: Up by $28 billion
Mortgages: Up by $77 billion

Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.

Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.


Areas of Personal Finance

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.

Income

Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.

Spending

Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.

Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.

Saving

Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.

Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.

Investing

Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.

Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.

Protection

Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.

Personal Finance Services

Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:

Wealth Management
Loans and Debt
Budgeting
Retirement
Taxes
Risk Management
Estate Planning
Investments
Insurance
Credit Cards
Home and Mortgage
Personal Finance Strategies

The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.

The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey surveyed 4,000 adults and found that most Americans are concerned about personal finance basics, retirement funding, and investing in crypto.

1. Know Your income

It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.

2. Devise a Budget

A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:

Fifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.
Thirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.
Twenty percent goes toward the future—paying down debt and saving for retirement and emergencies.

It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:

YNAB (You Need a Budget) helps you track and adjust your spending to control every dollar you spend.
PocketGuard is available in both free and paid versions. It uses an algorithm to help you avoid overspending by analyzing your income, bills, goals, and budget.
3. Pay Yourself First

It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.

Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.

4. Limit and Reduce Debt

It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.

On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.
2

Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it.
1
 There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.

Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:
3

Graduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years
Extended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years
Income-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)
5. Only Borrow What You Can Repay

Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.

Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).
4

Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.

Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs, and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your credit score is to constantly pay bills late—or even worse, miss payments.

Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.

6. Monitor Your Credit Score

Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.
5

Factors that determine your FICO score include:
6

Payment history (35%)
Amounts owed (30%)
Length of credit history (15%)
Credit mix (10%)
New credit (10%)

FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850.
7
 Here’s how your credit is rated:
8

Exceptional: 800 to 850
Very good: 740 to 799
Good: 670 to 739
Fair: 580 to 669
Poor: 579 and below

To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
9

Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.

Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.
10

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three major credit bureaus are providing free credit reports weekly. The program was extended twice in 2022 and it is now permanent.
11

7. Plan for Your Future

To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.

Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.

Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.

Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).

While your children are young, take the time to teach them about the value of money and how to save, invest, and spend wisely.

If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.

Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.

8. Buy Insurance

As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.

Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt.
12
 If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.

9. Maximize Tax Breaks

Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.

You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.

After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.
13

10. Give Yourself a Break

Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.

Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.

Personal Finance Skills

The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.

Finance Prioritization: This means that you can look at your finances, discern what keeps the money flowing in, and make sure that you stay focused on those efforts.
Assessing the Costs and Benefits: This key skill keeps professionals from spreading themselves too thin. Ambitious individuals always have a list of ideas about other ways that they can hit it big, whether it is a side business or an investment idea. While there is a place and time for taking a flier, running your finances like a business means stepping back and honestly assessing the potential costs and benefits of any new venture.
Restraining Your Spending: This is the final big-picture skill of successful business management that must be applied to personal finances. Time and again, financial planners sit down with successful people who still manage to spend more than they make. Earning $250,000 a year won’t do you much good if you spend $275,000 annually. Learning to restrain spending on non-wealth-building assets until after you’ve met your monthly savings or debt reduction goals is crucial in building net worth.
Personal Finance Education

Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.

Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.

Online Blogs

Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.

Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.

Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.

At the Library

You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.

Free Online Classes

If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:

Morningstar Investing Classroom offers a place for beginning and experienced investors alike to learn about stocks, funds, bonds, and portfolios. Some of the courses you’ll find include “Stocks Versus Other Investments,” “Methods for Investing in Mutual Funds,” “Determining Your Asset Mix,” and “Introduction to Government Bonds.” Each course takes about 10 minutes and is followed by a quiz to help you make sure that you understood the lesson.
14
EdX is an online learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
15
 It offers at least three courses that cover personal finance: 'Personal Finance, Part 1: Investing in Yourself"" from Wellesley College, “Personal Finance” from Purdue University, and “Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making” from the University of Michigan. These courses will teach you how credit works, which types of insurance you might want to carry, how to maximize your retirement savings, how to read your credit report, and what the time value of money is.
16
“Planning for a Secure Retirement” is an online course from Purdue University. It’s broken up into 10 main modules, and each has four to six sub-modules on topics such as Social Security, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs. You’ll learn about your risk tolerance, think about what kind of retirement lifestyle you want, and estimate your retirement expenses.
17
Podcasts

Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:

Freakonomics Radio and NPR’s Planet Money both make economics enjoyable by using it to explain real-world phenomena such as “how we got from mealy, nasty apples to apples that actually taste delicious,” the Wells Fargo fake-accounts scandal, and whether we should still be using cash.
American Public Media’s Marketplace helps make sense of what’s happening in the business world and the economy.
So Money with Farnoosh Torabi combines interviews with successful business people, expert advice, and listeners’ personal finance questions.

The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.

Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.

What Personal Finance Classes Can’t Teach You

Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:

Discipline

One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.

There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).

To be eligible for a health savings account, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).
18

Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.

Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.

A Sense of Timing

Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""

However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.

The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.

Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.

Emotional Detachment

Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.

Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.

The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.

Many people have loved ones who always seem to need financial help—it is difficult to refuse to help them. If you include planning to assist them in real emergencies using your emergency fund, it can make the burden easier.

Breaking Personal Finance Rules

The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.

Saving or Investing a Set Portion of Your Income

An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.

For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.

Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.

Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.

Long-term Investing/Investing in Riskier Assets

The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.

Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.

The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.

At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.

The Bottom Line

Budgeting apps are a great tool to help you get a grasp of your finances. But, they don't work on their own. Rather, you have to put in the work and use them consistently to see a difference. This means you can't reach financial goals automatically unless you commit the time and effort to improve your financial situation.

If you’re serious about budgeting apps, YNAB is a top choice thanks to its detailed budgeting strategy, excellent support, and helpful features. Simplifi by Quicken helps you personalize your spending plan while PocketGuard helps you rein in your spending. Empower gives you the best free option and Zeta works well for couples.


Budgeting can help you spend your money in a way that better aligns with your goals, but it won’t magically make more money appear. To do that, you’ll need to look for ways to increase your income.

 And with the rise in interest rates, borrowing money isn’t as easy as it used to be, making budgeting an increasingly popular alternative.  


Guide to Choosing the Best Budgeting App
What Is a Budgeting App?

Budgeting apps are personal finance tools that allow you to create a budget. Many apps require you to sync your bank accounts so you can track your monthly income and categorize expenses. All of your data is automatically imported into the app, which calculates how much money you have left over each month. This can give you an idea of where you can cut your spending and how much money you can set aside savings.


Budgeting may seem like a daunting task. But, it is necessary and doesn't happen on its own if you want to save money. To make it work, you have to put in the effort and do it consistently. Using a budgeting app can help you track your spending and keep your finances in check. You can assign a maximum dollar value to your monthly expenses, allowing you to save hundreds of dollars each month.

How to Choose a Budgeting App

Consider the following tips as you research budgeting apps to choose the right one for you:

Your goals: Determine why you want to use a budgeting app, whether that's to set savings, create an emergency fund, or help you fund a large purchase for the future.
Availability: Determine how you want to use the app and whether it is compatible with your device. It's always a good idea to see if the apps you're researching have desktop capability if you ever need to use them on a computer.
Free trial: Does the app offer a free trial? Free trials allow you to test the features without committing to or paying for an app.
Features: Your goals and financial situation will dictate which features you should seek. Don't commit or pay for an app with too many bells and whistles if you want to make simple changes to your financial life.
Automation: Ask yourself a few key questions. Do you want the app to work for you automatically or are you willing to manually track your finances? Can the app sync up with your bank account and other financial accounts? Keep in mind that you may have to do some manual tracking with certain automated budgeting apps—especially if you use cash for certain transactions.
Cost: How much are you willing to pay for the app? It doesn't make sense to sign up for a complicated app when you can't afford it, especially if it comes with features you won't use. There are also a lot of free budgeting apps that can help keep you on track.
Security: This is important, especially if you intend to link your bank accounts and credit cards to the app. You want to make sure that your financial information is safe and secure from hackers.

The best way to ensure that you have the right app for you is to read reviews and/or get recommendations. You can also speak to a financial professional to see if they can help guide you in the right direction.


Why Having a Budget is Important


Budgeting allows you to stay on track and meet your financial goals—even if you have money to spare each month. You can use a budget to track your income and expenses each month. This can help you cut back on wasteful spending, save money for the future, and reach some of your financial goals, whether that's to save up for a car, vacation, or a new home.

When you're budgeting, make sure you track every dollar that comes and goes out of your hands and your bank account. This includes any money you earn and your fixed and regular monthly bills (rent/mortgage, utilities, credit cards, loans, etc.) as well as any irregular expenses like travel and dining out.

How to Create a Budget


Follow these steps to create your budget:

List your goals. Why are you creating your budget and what would you like to do with your savings? You may be saving up for a big purchase, a vacation, for retirement, or to set aside a rainy day fund. Whatever your goals are, make sure they are realistic.
Determine your monthly income. This includes all of the money you earn every month. Do not include things like tax refunds as things like this will inflate your monthly earning figure.
Calculate your expenses:
Fixed monthly expenses. This should be all fixed expenses, such as housing, car payments, and student debt. Include any other things you pay for that come at a fixed, predictable cost.
Flexible monthly expenses. This list should include anything you spend money on each month that comes with a flexible cost. Groceries, entertainment, travel, and other similar items fall into this category.
Don't forget expenses that occur semi-regularly. Property taxes, insurance, and other expenses that you don't pay monthly but must still be accounted for should go on this list.
Choose your strategy. With the envelope strategy, you set aside cash each month for specific spending goals, such as groceries and entertainment. The 50/30/20 plan involves spending 50% of your income on necessities, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.
Rework your spending to fit your strategy. Make sure you make adjustments to your habits so you stick to your plan. Consider brown-bagging your lunch rather than buying it or giving up that morning brew from the neighborhood coffee shop to help keep you on track. You may also want to give up the credit card and start using cash.
Automate your payments. Setting up automatic debits can make your life easier because it takes the guesswork out of making your payments and keeping track of them.
Track how you're doing. Keeping tabs on your progress and making minor changes can help you stay on track. For instance, if you've paid off a debt, you can put that money to use in a different category.
Budgeting Apps vs. Expense Tracking Apps


You may have heard about expense tracking apps and are probably wondering how they differ from budgeting apps like the ones we highlighted above.

Budgeting apps allow you to actively manage your money. This means you have a solid grasp of what your income and expenses are each month. This includes setting aside a certain amount of money for groceries and entertainment so you stay within your limits. If you're using budgeting apps, you probably have clear goals about where and how you want to spend your money. Put simply, there are no surprises when it comes to your money because you know how and when it comes in and where it goes.

Expense tracking apps, on the other hand, allow you to paint a picture of how you spend your money each month. These apps record your bill payments and other expenses, such as your nights out, the clothes you buy, and the morning coffee you stop in for on your way to work each morning. At the end of the month, you get a clear picture of where your money went so you can determine if and where you can make adjustments to help you save money.

Check out our list of best expense tracking apps.

If you opt for the cash envelope budgeting method, make sure to keep track of your envelopes very carefully. If you lose an envelope, you can’t get your money back as easily as if you’d used a debit or credit card. 

Pros and Cons of Budgeting Apps
Pros

Ease of access: Mobile access can help at home and while you're on-the-go

Affordable or free: Many options come at a low cost or even free

Fewer errors: Automated syncing and record-keeping eliminates human error

Helpful, automated interfaces: Visuals and insights in real-time can help you with everyday decisions

Cons

Can be difficult to learn: Complex apps can be difficult to navigate and pick up

Cash can be hard to manage: Some apps require extra work if you're using cash

Must have an internet connection for syncing: You can lose access to your app if you don't have a connection

Potential for upsells: Some apps may try to sell you other products and services

Alternatives to Budgeting Apps

Keeping up with a budget is always a great idea but you don’t necessarily need an app to do it. Here are some other popular options in both the digital and analog realms that might work better for you: 

Budgeting software: If you’re not keen on using your phone you can do most—if not more—of the same things on a desktop computer that a mobile app would let you do. You may be able to log in to a program online or download a program on your computer.
Expense tracking apps: Budgeting can seem overwhelming and a good first step for many people is to simply track their spending. If that’s the case, a more streamlined app might be better for you.
Spreadsheet budgeting: Many people choose to make a DIY budget using a paper spreadsheet or a program like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. This lets you customize it how you want, although it is more work to put together and maintain. 
Cash envelope budgeting: You’ll take out paper cash and put it into categorized envelopes such as food, clothing, and gas with this method. This lets you set a stricter budget cap for yourself if you’ve had problems spending too much in the past.
Pay yourself first budgeting: If you hate the idea of budgeting, this method allows you to sidestep it entirely by setting up automated transfers into your savings account, with the remainder left over to spend as you wish. 


You may have heard of the 50/20/30 budget rule. This rule, which was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, suggests dividing your take-home pay three ways: 50% to your needs, 30% to your wants, and 20% to savings.
13
 Needs represent living expenses and other things you must spend on while wants are things that you don't necessarily need.

Why You Should Trust Us

Budgeting is a challenge for many people. While many folks want to reel in spending, it can be tedious to manually track expenses with a spreadsheet, making giving up all too easy. Luckily, there are budgeting apps to automate the process. But, the market is flooded with free and subscription-based apps, and most people don’t have the time or energy to test each out. Fortunately, we did the heavy lifting for you.

We considered 15 of the best companies on the market, comparing each app’s budgeting functionality, pricing, free trials, and user reviews. We compared the features, educational tools, security, and how each app accesses your financial data.

Here’s what you need to know.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-partner-8612447,"Having open conversations about finances is essential for any healthy romantic relationship. But no matter how long you’ve been lovebirds, bringing up money can feel awkward and uncomfortable.

A February 2023 study by Bread Financial found that baby boomers tend to discuss finances with their partners the least of any generation—only 13% of those surveyed admitted to talking about finances daily. Millennials were a different story; 39% claimed to discuss money daily with their partners. Yet, the study also found that “58% of millennials and 57% of Gen Z’ers report arguments with their partner over finances at least occasionally, whereas only 30% of boomers do the same.”1 

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Open communication about money is crucial for a healthy relationship.
Building trust about money matters and setting shared financial goals can strengthen your relationship.
Approach the conversation about money with empathy and understanding.
Create financial transparency by discussing income, expenses, and budgeting.

Not all money conversations are good ones, and there is such a thing as talking about the topic too much. Rather than prioritize frequency, it is best to focus on quality.

Certified financial planner R.J. Weiss says one of the easiest ways to start is to “Concentrate on future goals instead of past spending habits. Start with a question like, ‘What do we want our finances to look like in three years?’” This kind of open-ended question avoids finger pointing and provides a neutral starting point to discuss how each of you values money.

Regular and healthy talks about money can help you and your partner unpack financial fears and money scripts, as well as plan for financial independence and shared milestones.

Talking About Money Matters

A recent Forbes Advisor survey of 1,000 divorcees found that their number one reason for getting married was financial security (42%). Although finances didn’t top the reasons why they divorced, money matters played a significant role in common conflicts among couples who wound up divorcing. Forty-six percent reported career choices as the most prevalent topic of disagreement, while 43% said the division of household labor, and 28% named finances.2

If not addressed proactively, money issues like conflicting spending habits, opposing views on saving and investing, and dead-end jobs can breed resentment over time. Keeping lines of communication open within couples is essential to the overall solvency of a committed relationship, but it is just the first step. Discussing spending priorities, savings goals, and debt management can help you find compromises and solutions as a team.

Next, you may need to have financial conversations with children, aging parents, ex-spouses, co-parents, business partners, and anyone else who relies on your household income. Setting priorities within your partnership can help you speak with one voice when discussing boundaries with dependents.

Establish a Foundation of Trust

Many people were raised to believe that talking about money is rude or taboo. Raising the topic of money before your relationship is on solid emotional ground can feel like a recipe for disaster.

Yet, early transparency around money can help you determine if this partnership is going to work in the long term. It is less about how much money is in each bank account and more about whether you both see eye to eye about how you spend, save, and value money.

Starting these conversations from a nonjudgmental place helps both partners feel safe to reveal the emotions behind their money habits and to shift to more sustainable patterns in the future.

Weiss says it’s best to make financial discussions a regular part of your relationship routine, at least monthly. This normalizes conversations—rather than arguments—about money. You can use a common monthly billing cycle as the anchor to review your numbers. If you want to dig deeper into concepts, you can agree to read a personal finance book or listen to a money-focused podcast and discuss it monthly.

These periodic check-ins are opportunities to disclose money woes and craft strategies together. There are also times to acknowledge wins like promotions, investment growth, and debt paydown. Knowing your partner can handle the good and the bad is really what healthy relationships are made of.

However, you must expect that these conversations are going to be emotional. Try not to lash out in fear or anger when gathering new information about your partner’s money hygiene. Also, don’t beat yourself up about any slip-ups throughout the month. Listen with empathy and devise a plan to set things right. The intention is to build a culture of accountability and discipline, not one of extreme austerity or shame.

It may take time and care, but openly sharing money experiences without blame ultimately builds trust and strengthens intimacy.

Get Excited About Shared Financial Goals

The best part of sharing a life with someone is the prospect of doing what you love with someone you love.

Chances are, shared interests are what brought you and your partner together in the first place. Hone in on the meaningful life events and accomplishments you’d like to share with each other, and build conversations around the part each of you will play in ensuring that those milestones come to pass.

Once you get past the initial awkwardness, setting shared money goals can be incredibly bonding.

“Couples should set goals both individually and together and should understand what each of them is trying to accomplish and work towards,” says Lawrence D. Sprung, a wealth advisor and the host of the Mitlin Money Mindset podcast. “Although income and salaries may be different, as long as your goals are aligned, the combined incomes should be viewed as being available towards both your individual goals [and your goals] as a couple.”

Talking about money with your partner ensures that you both have a solid game plan to advance your lives as a couple.

Use These Tips to Talk to Your Partner About Money


Choosing the right time and place for money discussions ensures a nonconfrontational and supportive environment to tackle what could be a sensitive topic for you or your partner. These are effective strategies for initiating a conversation about money with your partner:

Work Through the Details

At first glance, figuring out the nitty-gritty of budgeting and expenses together can feel really overwhelming.

To make combining your finances more manageable, both partners have to be honest about their incomes, debts, and other financial obligations. Excessive privacy or vagueness breeds mistrust. Trust that you can share the details with your partner and that they won’t judge you but instead serve as a supportive sounding board.

Married couples can file their U.S. taxes jointly or separately. While filing jointly is most common, filing separately can be advantageous if there are large differences in medical bills, debts, and income between partners. The details matter.

Discuss Debt

“The important thing here is to have an honest and transparent conversation about your respective debt,” Sprung says. “Put it all on the table and begin to have a conversation about who is going to take care of the debt, one of you or both, and put a plan together to start extinguishing it immediately so you can start off on a clean slate as a couple.”

Couples approach debt in various ways. Some combine finances and include premarital debt in their joint financial goals, while others choose not to work together to pay off individual debt.

“Another approach I’ve seen work is to split debt repayment based on each partner’s income level,” Weiss says. “This method makes a lot of sense when the partner with higher debt, often due to student loans, also has a higher income.”

If either of you is carrying debt from a prior relationship, expect that these discussions might be more heated than those related to the debt you accumulate together. Rely on the foundation of trust to create a plan that you both can commit to.

Use Technology

Gone are the days of spreadsheets and shoe boxes full of receipts. Instead, you can use trackers on your credit and bank cards to closely monitor spending. If you share cards, all the transactions will be visible and accessible to discuss at your monthly money meeting. If you want to combine your finances, try apps that combine bank accounts and track spending as you swipe. 

The budgeting app Mint switched to Credit Karma in 2024 and no longer offers the same budgeting features. However, it will keep past data around net worth and add new finance trackers.3 The EveryDollar app and YNAB (You Need a Budget) are paid alternatives.

To curb frivolous spending or celebrate debt paydown, you can agree to set spending alerts on your accounts. Establish autopay to avoid any penalties or late fees. Don’t rely solely on memory and willpower to reach your collective goals, especially long-term ones like retiring, buying a house, or paying off student loans and consumer debt.

Swap ‘Shoulds’ for ‘Coulds’

Personal finance conversations are often laden with regret, no matter how much or how little money a person has. Hindsight is 20/20, and most people recognize that they could have made smarter money decisions at some point.

Rather than focus on what you or your partner should have done in the past, focus on the future. Consider what you could do now and which strategies resonate most with your financial goals. When talking about money, trade past-oriented shoulds with forward-thinking coulds.

For example, instead of criticizing yourself (or your partner) for not sticking to the budget last month, focus on adjustments that will help you stay on track next month. Keep a positive and hopeful attitude when addressing household finances.

Don’t Wait

It is easy to put off money conversations, but don’t wait too long. It’s better to have early and regular communication about finances in flux than to wait for a perfect moment that isn’t likely to come.

There will always be a payment that hasn’t cleared or an account issue to troubleshoot. That’s the very purpose of having these conversations regularly. Together, you can build solid money habits within your partnership and share oversight of your financial life.

Make It an Occasion

“Make these conversations something you look forward to. I’ve seen couples order takeout from one of their favorite restaurants, get dressed up, or open a bottle of wine,” Weiss says.

These money chats on a date night can be great for confirming if your timeline for the future will match up with the growth of your savings and investment accounts. They can also mark money wins for one or both of you. And these enjoyable settings can mute the blow of financial setbacks.

However, these occasions aren’t ideal for crunching numbers or tackling highly sensitive points of contention. In both cases, you should work with a professional. Accountants, couples counselors, and even tax preparers should be consulted in their offices or in a quiet, private setting where you can get the most value from their expertise.

Seek Outside Help When Needed

Sometimes, you and your partner might feel stuck on money issues even after repeated constructive attempts to work through things together. To get unstuck, consider getting unbiased guidance from a financial professional. Certified experts are required to stay abreast of the latest trends, tools, and tactics to make the most of any situation.

If talks consistently get heated and communication breaks down, try couples counseling to have a neutral party on hand to moderate difficult conversations. A therapist can help reveal the root issues driving money conflicts and provide tools to discuss finances in a healthy manner.

Meeting with a couples financial advisor can offer an impartial outside perspective. An expert can assess your complete financial picture collaboratively and map out customized strategies to help you gain clarity on financial decisions or overcome hurdles.

Other professionals you should seek include career counselors, headhunters, investment advisors, bank account managers, and more.

Tip

Debtors Anonymous offers free in-person, online, and phone-based fellowship for singles and couples looking to change their mindset about money.

How Can I Start the Money Talk without Causing a Fight?

Don’t spring it on your spouse or partner suddenly, and don’t come on too strong. Ease into it by mentioning that you’d like to set aside time to casually discuss your hopes and goals related to money. Pick a relaxed day without distractions. Frame it as a chance to dream together, not point fingers.

What Are Some Usual Challenges That Couples Have with Money?

Some of the most common money issues between couples include fears about the economy, saving vs. spending, and how to communicate about money, according to an Orion survey. Nearly half of couples surveyed said that they considered dishonesty about money a form of infidelity.4

How Can Shared Goals Help?

Having a common vision to work toward builds unity and teamwork. It motivates you to compromise or make sacrifices for each other’s benefit. Having a singular and shared goal can also highlight your money strengths and weaknesses. Together, you can improve habits that will sustain your relationship.

Are There Resources for Managing Money as a Couple?

Yes. Try apps like Honeydue or Zeta. They help couples budget and track finances together. Sites like CoupleWise offer courses and tips. Or meet with a financial advisor or counselor for personalized guidance.

When Should We Seek Outside Help with Money Issues?

If you constantly argue about the same topics, don’t struggle alone. Seek counseling or financial help. Money is a top cause of relationship problems, but professionals can help.

What Are Financial Red Flags in a Partner That I Shouldn’t Ignore?

Secrecy about money, uncontrolled spending, reckless gambling or investing, avoiding paying debts, and repeated unwillingness to discuss finances openly can be problematic. Use caution if these are ongoing concerns.

The Bottom Line

Transparent communication is crucial for a healthy relationship, money talks included.

Start with trust and empathy. These early discussions can focus on establishing a baseline of understanding about how your individual money scripts need to change if you’re going to share a future. Raising financial matters with your partner isn’t just about discussing debt. You also need to set shared financial goals, discuss career and income changes, and adjust budgets to suit your needs.

Since financial plans change over a lifetime, expect that the discussion will always continue. Pace yourself. If some topics are heavier than others, give it time and patience before revisiting intractable issues with the help of experts. Whether you combine finances or keep them separate, neither partner should be kept in the dark. Financial transparency is a pillar of a successful relationship.

debt-free strategy mindset shifts effectiveness,investopedia,Getting Real: How to Talk About Money with Friends,"Talking about money with friends can be tricky. However, with the right ground rules, you can use these discussions to gain valuable perspective and advice.",https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-talk-about-money-with-friends-8608029,"Money is a deeply personal topic. But by keeping our finances under wraps from friends, we may be missing out on valuable advice, deeper relationships, and new perspectives.

“Having a friend or a group of friends that you can talk to about money can radically shift your relationship with it,” says Grant Sabatier, author of Financial Freedom and creator of Millennial Money. “The more you think about money and talk about money, the more comfortable that you get with it.”

Here are some helpful tips on how to start the conversation, set boundaries, and help one another toward financial independence.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Discussing money with friends can help you build stronger relationships and foster financial well-being.
Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is crucial for open and honest money conversations.
Starting the conversation with interesting and indirect questions can help break the ice and encourage participation.
Setting boundaries and expectations can prevent conflicts and ensure productive discussions.
Seeking educational resources and working with financial advisors and financial therapists can enhance your financial journey.
How to Start the Conversation

Before deciding what you want to talk about, you will want to determine who you want to talk with.

Casually incorporating personal finance topics into your conversations with friends can help you figure out which friends share your financial values and what tone you want the conversation to have. Here are some questions to open the conversation without getting into the nitty-gritty:

Are you more of a spender or a saver?
What’s more worth it: an experience or an item?
Can money buy happiness?

For me and many of my college-aged friends, investing in a Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA), opening a high-yield savings account, or amassing a strong credit score are points of pride. As Sabatier suggests, speaking with friends in similar financial situations to your own helps you relate to one another without a sense of competition.

“Talking with people who were in the exact same situation as me about money was very, very effective,” Sabatier says. “It’s being on a life journey with someone else who’s where you’re at.”

How to Create a Judgment-Free Environment

Creating a safe and judgment-free environment is key to having constructive conversations and building relationships with your friends. Here are some tips for setting the tone and building trust.

Set Ground Rules 

Before you jump into a conversation, some financial experts advise setting ground rules and objectives.1 Here are some sample rules that I have used with my friends:

Keep the conversation confidential
Speak using “I” statements
Actively listen without interrupting
Do not pass judgment
Avoid comparisons

This step may feel overly formal, but it can help define the conversation’s terms and avoid later discomfort.

Lead by Example

Sabatier says that by embodying the tone that you want the conversation to take, your friends will be able to pick up on your language and demeanor to support a constructive conversation.

Especially if you’re initiating the conversation, you may need to demonstrate to your friends that an easy and comfortable money chat is achievable in the first place. Imagine if one of your friends approached you to discuss personal finance, and they immediately began passing judgments on your expenses, insisting that you use the same budget tracker that they do, or complaining about their own financial situation (which you know is more stable than your own). That would be horrible!

Modeling practices can help you avoid these situations and lay a foundation for success.

Adopt a Growth Mindset

You have a whole financial future ahead of you, and nothing is set in stone. Your financial situation will likely ebb and flow throughout your life, and centering growth and positivity in conversations with friends can improve your mindset and help you cultivate stronger financial relationships with your friends.

According to Kristin Wong, author of Get Money, a financial freedom guide for young people, confiding in friends about financial situations can be very helpful and reassuring.

“It can be really hard not to internalize our money challenges and see them as personal shortcomings,” Wong says. “Talking about those issues openly with a friend can make you feel a little less alone. Most of us have been there, and there’s a good chance your friends have, too.”

Set Boundaries and Expectations

The greatest risk when discussing money with friends is that the conversation becomes uncomfortable, and it jeopardizes your friendship. According to Sabatier and Wong, setting expectations and boundaries for money conversations can stop this problem at the root.

Personally, my precise account balances are off-limits to friends. Some of my friends are uncomfortable speaking about their financial support from their parents, and other friends choose not to talk about their college financial aid packages.

We each have different preferences, and being upfront about them can benefit your relationships in the long run.

“You can still have a candid conversation about money without sharing the nitty-gritty details of your financial life,” Wong says. “If you’re talking to the right person, you should feel comfortable setting boundaries on specific details, like your income or debt amounts, to maintain privacy and prevent any potential discomfort.”

If you do run into issues with navigating sensitive topics, it’s best to tackle any miscommunication or discomfort head-on. Some conflicts may represent a flaw in your approach to financial conversations with friends, and they could be signs to reevaluate boundaries or limits on advice.

Set Financial Goals Together

Setting financial goals with your friends can keep you motivated and improve your financial literacy. According to Wong, by sharing financial successes and failures, you can better evaluate your financial strategies.

“Friends in the same age group often face similar financial challenges: student loans, entry-level salaries, budget constraints, and so on,” Wong says. “Most young adults have a shared understanding of what it is to struggle financially, so you can create a community that fosters financial literacy and cheers each other on when it comes to financial goals.”

Address Differences in Financial Situations

When you’re in college, you and your friends all live in the same dorms and eat the same dining hall food, but when you’re in the real world, financial disparities between you and your friends will probably become more obvious—especially as you embark on different career paths.

It’s certainly not impossible to navigate money conversations with friends in different financial situations, especially if you share the same values. However, you should address financial differences head-on and approach these conversations intentionally, to prevent feelings of pity or resentment.

“You really have to come to it from a place of love, and respect, and understanding. Try to put yourself in the person’s shoes that you’re talking with, and recognize how you talk about money will make them feel,” Sabatier says. “If you have more money than them, often talking with someone who doesn’t have as much money can come off as bragging or make them feel bad because they’re not in this similar position.”

Seek Professional Help If Needed

While speaking about money with friends can be very helpful, these relationships have their limits, and you may want or need additional support from a financial advisor or educational source.

“You can get valuable insight from friends while also seeking help from a professional,” Wong says. “It’s like going to a therapist, right? A good therapist is going to help you process whatever you’re going through, but your friends can be there for you, too.”

Here are some helpful resources for finding a financial planner:

National Association of Personal Financial Advisors
CFP Board
XY Planning Network

Of course, hiring a financial advisor may not be financially realistic for many young people. According to Wong, older friends or colleagues can be helpful resources. You can also look into robo-advisor programs, which can help you manage your money for much less than a traditional financial advisor.

As Sabatier notes, a financial advisor can be very helpful, but you should always try to do your own research before seeking out a professional.

“​​Unfortunately, the financial industry is so predatory, and it’s really built around exploiting people and exploiting what they don’t know,” Sabatier says. “So if you know a little bit, you’re not gonna get scammed or the likelihood is gonna be a lot less, and you’re gonna be able to ask better questions for yourself.”

Here are some resources for self-education:

How Do You Start a Conversation Asking for Money?

Asking for money can be hard and often embarrassing. If you want to ask a friend or family member, it is important to approach the matter seriously, being direct and honest. You should explain why you need the money, provide a clear timeline for repayment, and thank the person for hearing you out.

Still, some experts in financial planning for young adults warn against lending or borrowing from friends and family.

“I think it’s probably best to avoid co-signing or lending money to friends because it has the potential to ruin friendships, and our friendships are more important than money,” Wong says.

Can a Friend or Family Member Help Me with Bill Paying and Banking?

You can ask a friend or family member to help you with bill paying and banking, but you should know that this move could come with uncomfortable consequences or power imbalances in your personal relationships.

If you have already decided that you want to ask a friend or family member for help with bill paying and banking, you have both formal and informal options.

Informal loans could involve your close friend cutting you a check with an informal agreement that you will pay the money back in a set amount of time.

More formal options could include a convenience account that allows you to designate a person to help you with depositing, withdrawing, and writing checks. Alternatively, adding a friend or family member to your account as a trusted contact would notify that person if your bank suspects a financial scam, and granting a person close to you power of attorney would give them the ability to act on your behalf regarding your finances.2


Who Is the Best Person to Talk to About Finances?

While there is no “best” person to talk to about finances, some financial experts say that you may find it helpful to consult your friends and family about personal finance questions. Given that these people are deeply familiar with your values and character, they may be able to provide you with more candid and personalized advice than a financial advisor or therapist.

Regardless of who you talk to about your personal finances, you should make an effort to educate yourself on different financial products and services before entering into a conversation. Resources like Investopedia’s Financial Literacy Resource Center, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Endowment for Financial Education provide foundational finance knowledge, so you can know your options and control your money.

The Bottom Line

Friends can be a great resource for personal finance matters. However, it’s essential to recognize the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations when engaging in financial discussions with friends. By openly communicating personal preferences and boundaries, you can foster healthier relationships and avoid potential discomfort or misunderstandings.

Beyond friends, you may want to seek professional guidance from financial advisors and external financial education resources. Ultimately, by navigating financial discussions with friends sensitively, you can strengthen your friendships while enhancing your financial well-being."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,4 Easy Budgeting Techniques,"To create and stick to a budget, it’s helpful to have some tricks up your sleeve. Here are some easy tactics to keep you on track.",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112116/four-easy-budgeting-techniques-you-should-master.asp,"For some people, budgeting money comes naturally; they like being organized and tracking data. For others, it’s a bit more challenging. Facts and figures aren’t their forte and constant monitoring is tedious. Even if you fall into the latter category, the process can be made easier with a few quick tricks.

Here are four easy techniques that will make budget planning a breeze.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Dump the receipts. Use an app to track your expenses.
Automate your bill-paying and monthly savings.
Be flexible, but if you constantly bust your budget revise it.
1. Automate Your Tracking

There's no real reason these days to save your receipts in a pile and wade through them later. There are apps for that.

A smartphone app or software program can help you track your budget. These programs often use the same security systems that online banks do, so if you choose a reputable tracker, you should not be concerned with the safety of your information.

The programs will not only track your spending but will help you categorize your purchases, send you alerts when you are nearing your budget limits, and help you set long-term financial goals and keep to them.

2. Automate Your Spending

Automatic bill payment and automatic transfers of money into a checking account can take some of the difficulty out of sticking to a budget.

After all, if you never see the money in your checking account you won’t spend it on things that are not in your budget. Just be sure to keep enough funds in the account to cover your automated expenses so that you aren’t hit with overdraft fees. 

Coordinate Deposits and Withdrawals

One way to avoid this risk is to set all automatic withdrawals to hit at the same time that your paycheck is deposited so that your money goes directly toward the bills and your savings goals at a time that you know you will have sufficient funds in your account.

Some employers will even direct deposit a designated amount into a savings account each pay period while putting the balance into your checking account.

3. Be Flexible

Your budget has to be flexible enough to absorb some of life's nasty little surprises. Inevitably, unforeseen expenses will come up and bust your budget.

It's important to recognize that a budget is a tool that can be adjusted if it isn’t aligning with your spending.

If you go over budget a few times, don’t beat yourself up. Instead, plan for a slightly larger emergency fund as a cushion. If you continually go over, it’s time to reassess your spending. You're paying out more than you can afford and you need to make some adjustments.

4. Consider Your Future

Most people understand the difference between wants and needs when it comes to budgeting. However, many people incorrectly place savings in the optional spending category.

The Bottom Line

Planning for your retirement, building an emergency fund, and saving for long-term goals are all critical for your financial health. They should not be considered optional expenses that can be eliminated when they're inconvenient.

Even if it means forgoing dinner out or cutting the cable bill, saving money needs to be a mandatory part of your budget. You want to be financially prepared to meet your long-term goals, whether you want to buy a house, travel the world, or pay off debts."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,How to Start a Family and Save for Retirement,"To start a family and save for retirement, you’ll need to plan ahead and take advantage of cost reduction strategies, tax benefits, and budgeting techniques.",https://www.investopedia.com/family-and-retirement-8599280,"Starting a family while saving for retirement comes with challenges and benefits. In most cases, time is on your side.

If you start early, you still have plenty of time to grow your retirement savings and benefit from compound interest. And there are a number of tax-advantaged plans out there to help you do so without incurring a huge tax bill.

On the other hand, starting relatively young means you may still be building your career and income. According to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2023” report, the average retirement savings account balance for ages 35–44 is $76,354. For ages 25–34, that number is just $30,017. On top of that, there’s buying a home, a car, and paying for your children’s college and weddings to account for.

The good news is that with the right tools and strategies, planning for both your family’s needs and your retirement is entirely possible.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Plan ahead and start saving early to balance starting a family with building a successful retirement plan.
Understand common costs for individuals and couples who want to raise children while saving for retirement.
Assess your financial situation, set goals as a family, and create a budget to meet those goals.
Take advantage of cost reduction strategies and tax benefits available to families.
Use tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save for retirement.
Costs to Consider

In general, the stereotypical American Dream is becoming more expensive. Take the average cost of raising two children until age 18, estimated at $576,896. The average amount needed to retire is even higher, clocking in at $715,968, according to Investopedia’s recent analysis.

Understanding the various costs you may face is the first step to preparing for them. Couples or individuals who are starting a family should consider the following.

Having a Baby or Adopting

If you’re enrolled in a large group plan, out-of-pocket costs for a hospital birth average $2,854 per child. When it comes to adoption, costs vary widely depending on whether you adopt via the public child welfare system, a private agency, independent adoption, or intercountry adoption.

According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adoption from a private agency may cost $30,000 to $60,000.

Independent or intercountry adoption ranges from $20,000 to $50,000, whereas adopting a child from the welfare system is virtually free. The associated expenses may include home study, court and legal fees, and social work or counseling services.

Paying for Child Care

Child care has long been a substantial expense for families. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deems child care as “affordable” when it costs no more than 7% of a family’s household income. Yet many families spend 10% to 24% of household income on child care.

Child care costs vary by state. For example, the average cost of infant care in Alabama is around $500 per month and $432 each month for a 4-year-old. In California, the average monthly cost of infant care is $1,412, and $956 for a 4-year-old. And in Michigan, you’d pay an average of $905 per month for infant care or $741 per month for a 4-year-old.

Saving for Higher Education

Putting your kids through college is a major cost, no matter how you slice it. For academic year 2021–22, the average total cost for full-time undergraduate attendance was $32,900 at a private for-profit institution and $55,800 at a private nonprofit institution. Meanwhile, public institutions had an average total cost of $26,000.

These amounts represent the sum of tuition and required fees, books, supplies, and the average cost of room and board for students living on campus at four-year institutions.

Keep in mind that this amount doesn’t reflect the various types of financial aid that students may receive.

Assess Your Financial Situation

Evaluating your current financial situation is a crucial step toward reaching your personal financial goals. A thorough assessment of your income, expenses, and savings potential will provide valuable insights into your overall financial health and areas for improvement.

Here are key aspects to consider when assessing your finances:

Income

Calculate your gross annual income by adding up all sources of earnings, such as wages, salaries, self-employment profits, interest, dividends, and rental income. Be sure to account for any changes in employment status, promotions, or new job opportunities throughout the year.

Expenses

Create a detailed list of all ongoing and ad hoc expenses, categorizing them accordingly. Common categories include housing, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, healthcare, debt payments, entertainment, subscriptions, and miscellaneous expenses.

To get a clear picture of your spending habits, track your expenses over several months by using budgeting tools like spreadsheets, mobile apps, or online resources provided by banks and credit unions.

Savings Potential

Determine your disposable income by calculating the amount left from your income after paying taxes and necessary expenses. Then, evaluate whether you have enough funds available for emergency savings, retirement planning, investments, and discretionary spending.

Establish Family Priorities

With an understanding of the costs involved and a clear picture of your financial situation, you can begin to prioritize and outline future goals—both for your family and your retirement. Specific goals will depend on you, your partner, and your financial situation. But the following are a good place to start:

Start or Grow Your Emergency Fund 

If an unexpected car repair, pet expense, or medical emergency suddenly popped up, would you have enough cash to cover it? What if you got laid off next month?

If you aren’t prepared, an unexpected expense could derail your savings plans. That's why financial experts always recommend having an emergency fund to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses. If you’re self-employed or your income is unpredictable, you’ll want to save even more.

Having a safety net set aside keeps you from having to use credit cards or dipping into your retirement savings. The best place for an emergency fund is a liquid and thus easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings or other interest-earning account.


Put Retirement First

When setting financial goals, it’s natural for parents to want to put their children first. But financial planners recommend prioritizing your own retirement over saving for a child’s education.

While students have access to loans, grants, and scholarships, there are no such resources for parents. Saving for retirement falls largely on the individual—with some help from your employer if you’re lucky.

So, contribute as much as you can to your retirement savings accounts, and take advantage of any 401(k) or Health Savings Account (HSA) matching programs that your company offers.

Plan Ahead for Education Savings 

Once you hit your retirement savings goals, the next step is saving for your kids’ college tuition. A 529 plan is a great way to do this, since it’s specifically designed to help pay for higher education.

This tax-advantaged account allows contributions to grow federal income tax-deferred, with tax-free withdrawals for qualified higher education expenses (such as tuition and room and board).

Establish Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Goals for Your Family 

For families who may feel overwhelmed by competing financial goals—like buying a home, saving for a child's education, or retirement—Mike Kojonen, founder of Principal Preservation Services, recommends setting goal milestones.

“For example, rather than seeing retirement as a distant, abstract aim, break it down into actionable steps like increasing retirement contributions annually or setting up a dedicated college savings fund for their children,” he says.

These targets can be broken down into specific short-, medium-, and long-term financial objectives for your family. For instance, building an emergency fund, contributing to employer-matched retirement plans, and establishing a consistent saving habit might serve as short-term goals.

Long-term goals often include caring for aging parents or, if your children are young, saving for their college education. Medium-term goals (say, five years) could include a family vacation, buying a new car, or remodeling your home.

Consider having a conversation with family members or a financial advisor to help outline these priorities and get on the same page.

Mark Damsgaard, head of client advisory at Global Residence Index, also recommends that couples discuss whether they’ll keep some assets separate or share all assets.

“It’s not wrong to not share the entirety of your assets, especially if you worked hard for them on your own. And then you may talk about having joint accounts for the earnings and assets you acquire when you enter your marriage or partnership,” Damsgaard says.


Revisit Your Budget

Achieving financial goals is often easier when you have a budget to give structure and clarity to your spending habits. A budget works best when it’s based on the specifics of your situation.

Use what you’ve learned about known costs for major goals like family and retirement, your financial situation, and your long- and short-term goals to set a realistic budget. Compare the following common budgeting models to see what works best for you.

50/30/20 Rule

The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% of income to needs (such as housing, food, and utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, and hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment (including retirement savings). While it may not work for everyone, this rule is popular because of its simplicity.

Progressive Budgeting

With progressive budgeting, you gradually increase savings and retirement contributions as your income grows or your family’s financial situation improves. Progressive budgeting is particularly useful in working against lifestyle creep, a common phenomenon that can eat into your retirement and family savings if you aren’t careful.

Pay Yourself First

Pay yourself first is exactly what it sounds like. You set aside money from your income for debt payments and savings, including retirement contributions, before taking care of other bills.

Of course, you still need to account for rent and other ongoing expenses. But this method, sometimes called reverse budgeting, makes it easy to prioritize savings goals. For example, you could set up automatic transfers or contributions to retirement accounts before allocating money for other uses.


Tips for Balancing Saving for a Family and Retirement

Reducing costs and maximizing tax benefits mean more money that you can put toward retirement or family goals.

See Where You Can Reduce Costs 

Lowering your child care bill can amount to major savings. Consider enlisting help from neighbors and family members or arranging child care swaps with other parents. Some states also offer government-funded assistance programs to help families pay for child care.

Government resources include Head Start and Early Head Start programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, military child care financial assistance programs, and government vouchers or subsidies. You should also see if your employer offers a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA).

To save money beyond child care costs, look into other possibilities like:

Mortgage refinancing to reduce your monthly payment
Adjusting your thermostat or using energy-efficient bulbs to save on utility bills
Carpooling, using public transportation, or walking/cycling to trim transportation costs
Cutting food costs by cooking at home, buying store brands, and planning meals ahead of time

Maximize Tax Benefits 

There are tax benefits designed to help families save money, including:

Child Tax Credit (CTC): The CTC provides a tax credit of up to $2,000 per qualifying child under the age of 17. For 2024, up to $1,700 of the tax credit may be refundable, depending on your tax situation.
Child and Dependent Care Credit: This credit covers expenses for child care services, such as babysitting, daycare, or preschool, for children under age 13 or disabled spouses or parents. The credit ranges from 20% to 35% of expenses up to $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents.
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Low- and moderate-income working families can benefit from the EITC, which reduces the amount of tax owed and may result in a tax refund. The credit is based on a percentage of earned income, with higher income phaseouts for taxpayers with children.
Credit for Other Dependents: This is available to taxpayers with a dependent who doesn’t qualify for the Child Tax Credit, such as children age 17 or older, qualifying relatives, or dependent parents.
Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction: This permits self-employed parents to deduct 100% of the cost of health insurance premiums paid for family members, including children under age 27.

Take Advantage of Retirement Savings Options

Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts to maximize savings and growth.

401(k) Plans: Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary toward retirement savings, often with employer matching contributions.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Traditional IRAs are personal retirement accounts that provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA: SEP and SIMPLE IRAs let small business owners and self-employed individuals save for retirement while receiving tax benefits.
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): For families or individuals with a high-deductible health plan, HSAs offer flexible options for saving money on healthcare or boosting retirement savings.

How Much Should I Save Monthly for Retirement?

The amount you should save monthly for retirement will vary based on your income, age, and retirement goals. Financial experts recommend saving at least 10% to 15% of your income for retirement—including your employer match, if you have one. If possible, bumping that up to 20% of your income can help you save significantly more over time. This is especially helpful if you’ve started later on saving for retirement.

What Are the Best Retirement Savings Options for Families?

You can use a number of strategies to help you save for retirement, including tax-advantaged retirement accounts like traditional or Roth 401(k)s and IRAs, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs (if you’re self-employed), HSAs, or other investment accounts. For parents who want to start putting money away for their children, custodial IRAs offer tax-advantaged savings.

The best retirement plan to build your nest egg will depend on your financial situation, your goals for retirement, and other factors. Understand the contribution limits, withdrawal penalties, and tax rules surrounding accounts to help you make the best decision. You may want to consult a financial advisor.


What Is the 5% Rule for Retirement Savings?

The 5% rule is a frequently used rule of thumb for calculating how much you can withdraw from retirement savings each year without running out of money. A modified version of the traditional 4% rule, the 5% rule allows for a higher annual withdrawal rate, which may work for long-term investors with diversified portfolios. Work with a financial advisor to assess whether the 5% withdrawal rate aligns with your retirement objectives, investment strategy, and overall financial plan.

The Bottom Line

Armed with knowledge about your goals, potential costs, financial situation, and available tools for investing, you can achieve a comfortable retirement while also growing a family. Start early and contribute consistently to retirement savings in order to maximize your savings and growth potential. If needed, seek professional financial advice to help you navigate the complexities of retirement planning and evaluate the best decisions based on your specific situation."
budgeting techniques for saving money,investopedia,Budgeting Calculator,This free budgeting calculator shows how to divide your income between savings and spending.,https://www.investopedia.com/budgeting-calculator-5101411,"A Monthly Budgeting Calculator to Help Take Control of Your Finances

Are you struggling to keep your spending below your income? Do you strategize about how to increase your savings? Our free budgeting calculator will help you save time and avoid mistakes when you need to understand where your money is going every month.

How the Budgeting Calculator Works 

To use our free budgeting calculator, just enter your monthly income and expenses. We’ll show you what percentage of your income you’re spending (or saving) in each category and whether you’re living within or beyond your means.

The output from using the budgeting calculator shows the percentage of your income that goes toward each category. Seeing the results in pie-chart form makes it easy to tell where most of your money goes. It breaks down your total monthly income and total monthly expenses while displaying the percentages of your income that are spent in specific areas. And it shows the total monthly funds that remain after you've accounted for all those expenses. The bigger the gap, the more extra funds you may have.

Key Components of a Budget Calculation

The categories below offer a basic framework that you can use to organize your expenses and think about the amounts that might be reasonable for you in each category. Everyone’s finances are different, and this calculator is a tool to help you, so use it in the way that makes the most sense for how you think about your money. You don’t have to allocate your expenses exactly as we describe.

Start by filling in the budgeting calculator with your real expenses. If some are uneven (you buy more clothes some months than others), calculate an annual average. Take a screenshot of the results. Then see how you can improve your remaining monthly funds by adjusting expenses that are discretionary—what budget experts call ""wants."" Where are your savings opportunities?

Total Monthly Income

Make sure to use your after-tax income for the whole family here—your budget is about the money you have available to spend. This should include your income from wages and salaries, gig work or part-time jobs, bonuses, child support, alimony, tips, Social Security, distributions, settlements, and any other sources of income.

Housing

Four walls, a floor, and a roof comprise most people’s biggest expense. A common rule of thumb is to limit housing costs to 30% of your income. For many households this is a challenge: Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies considers a household “moderately cost-burdened” when housing costs 31% to 49% of income, and “severely cost-burdened” when housing takes up 50% or more of income. In 2021, about 23% of U.S. households were cost burdened.1 Include your rent or mortgage payment in this category as well as renter’s insurance or homeowners insurance. Homeowners will also include any maintenance fees in this category.

Electricity, natural gas, water service, trash pickup, and the like are added together and go into this category. It can be hard to make a dent in these monthly bills without significant changes to your energy use, and some of those changes require upfront investments that take a long time to pay off, such as energy-efficient light bulbs, appliances, and heating and cooling systems. Caulking and weather stripping to seal gaps around doors and windows is one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to achieve savings here, even if you’re not handy and on a tight budget.

Line items like property taxes or homeowners association fees can fill in the other area, including any other housing-related costs that need to be counted.

Food

In this category, add your essential groceries for the whole family. Add in any prepared meal kits and restaurant meals. Don't forget to account for takeout deliveries.

Transportation

The average household spent $12,295 on transportation in 2022 (the most recently available data), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average income before taxes was $94,003, meaning the average person’s transportation spending takes up 11.6% of their income.2 In this category, you’ll include costs such as public transit, car payments, auto insurance, parking, tolls, and gasoline or fuel. If you use taxis and ride-sharing services, be sure to add those into the line item for other/miscellaneous expenses, along with any additional transportation expenses.

Education

Many people have no education expenses. Others are funding their children’s (or grandchildren’s) education or paying back student loans. There’s no rule of thumb for the percentage of your budget that should go toward schooling. Good options for keeping these costs down include creating a 529 savings plan and refinancing private student loans.

Personal and Family

If you have dependents, include expenses here that you haven’t already included in other categories. These might be costs for cellphone bills, clothes and shoes, household supplies, and vacation planning funds. Do you spend money on entertainment? Account for streaming services, museum and fitness memberships, and tickets to events in this section. Personal care (haircuts, toiletries, manicures) and pet care (vet visits, pet food, pet insurance) can also go in this category.

Debt payments outside of mortgages and student loans should go in this section. This involves adding together credit cards and personal loan payments. Add in costs such as child care, adult day care, tutoring and lessons, and charitable donations into the ""other"" section.

Healthcare

Medical, dental, and vision care insurance premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance or copays should go in this category, along with any medications (prescription and over-the-counter ones) and medical devices you use. Your premiums will be the same every month, but the other expenses can fluctuate depending on whether you get sick, need a health screening, require new glasses, or something else. Use past spending or make your best guess at your annual cost in this category, then divide by 12.

Savings and Investments

If your income allows for it, a good rule of thumb is to allocate 20% of your income to savings and investments. In addition to keeping cash in the bank for emergencies, you should funnel money into a tax-advantaged retirement account for investments. If you’ve covered those bases, you might allocate extra money to a college savings account, save for a down payment on a home, or funnel money to a taxable brokerage account in which you hold tax-free or low-tax investments, such as municipal bonds and Treasury securities. You can use the ""other"" section for any additional savings goals you might have.

Budgeting Techniques and Philosophies

Here are some helpful methods for creating a personal spending plan. Would one of these work for you?

50/30/20 Method

This method says you should aim to spend roughly 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and investments. If you live with your parents or have a paid-off mortgage, you might spend less on needs and more on wants and savings. If your housing takes up 50% of your income, you’ll have to spend less on wants and possible savings. You can adjust the percentages to suit your situation; the idea is to take a big-picture approach to your spending instead of nitpicking every category.

80/20 Method

For this method, you save and invest 20% of your income, then spend the other 80% however you want. It’s an even simpler method than the 50/30/20 method. It can work well for people who don’t have the time or desire to account for their expenses in detail. You can change the numbers to achieve your own savings goals. People who want to achieve financial independence and retire early—or those who are trying to catch up on retirement savings later in life—might use a 70/30, 60/40, or 50/50 split.

Zero-based Budgeting

A zero-based budget assigns a purpose to every last dollar of your income. When you subtract your savings and expenses from your income, the result will be zero. It’s helpful for people who prefer something more detailed than the 50/30/20 or 80/20 methods. If your income and expenses are complicated (for example, you have multiple, variable sources of income and more than 100 expenses per month), this method may be too time-consuming for you.

The Envelope System

If you use this budgeting system, you’ll allocate a specific amount of money to each budget category at the beginning of the month. When you’ve spent what you’ve allocated to a category, you’re done for the month, unless you can move money out of another category. For example, if your electric bill is $100 and you only put $80 in your literal or figurative electricity envelope, you’ll have to take $20 out of the grocery envelope (or some other envelope). 

The envelope system is a good method for people who are on a tight budget or trying to stop overspending. It originated with the idea of literally putting cash in envelopes, but you can keep your cash safely in the bank and use software or a pencil and paper instead.

It's easy to get off track if you don't follow a budget when you make one. Tech tools for budgeting can help make tracking a budget easier—even fun. Find a budgeting app or budgeting software that you find easy and helpful to use.

Benefits of Using a Budget

Budgeting adds one more thing to your to-do list, and who has time for that? You should, because the extra time and effort it takes to make a budget are worth it. For the skeptics, here are four main benefits of budgeting.

Benefit 1: Maximize your returns from working—You probably spend 20 to 50 hours a week earning money. If you’re not spending and saving consciously and carefully, you’re not getting the maximum benefit from the time you spend working. That means you’re probably going to spend even more time working and less time enjoying friends, family, hobbies, and sleep.
Benefit 2: Gain a sense of control—It’s easy to feel like expenses are happening to you, especially if money is tight. Planning your budget at the beginning of every month can make you feel like you’re choosing where your money goes. It can also help you see where you might be able to make room for saving more or paying down debt faster so that unexpected costs become less likely to set you way back.
Benefit 3: Achieve your goals—You might have a goal of traveling to Tokyo, buying a car, or becoming a one-income household instead of a two-income household. Whatever motivates you, budgeting can help you get there by helping you set financial goals and prioritize where your money is going.
Benefit 4: Spot problems before they catch you off guard—When you create a budget, you’ll be able to see clearly that only having $30 left at the end of the month to put toward your credit card bill puts you at serious risk of being unable to get out of debt or lack the money you'll need to help put your kid through school. You might not be able to solve the problem immediately, but you could start taking steps in the right direction, whether it’s learning how to improve your credit score so you can refinance your debt at a lower interest rate or researching options for a less expensive education."
snowball method debt repayment success rate,investopedia,"Debt Avalanche: Meaning, Pros and Cons, and Example",A debt avalanche is an accelerated system of paying down debt that is based on paying the loan with the highest interest rate first. Learn how to use the debt avalanche.,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-avalanche.asp,"What Is a Debt Avalanche?

A debt avalanche is a type of accelerated debt repayment plan. Essentially, a debtor allocates enough money to make the minimum payment on each source of debt, then devotes any remaining repayment funds to the debt with the highest interest rate. Using the debt avalanche approach, once the debt with the highest interest rate is entirely paid off, then the extra repayment funds go toward the next highest interest-bearing loan. This process continues until all the debts are paid off.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The debt avalanche is a systematic way of paying down debt to save money on interest.
Individuals who use the debt avalanche strategy make the minimum payment on each debt, then use any remaining available funds to pay the debt with the highest interest rates.
A debt avalanche is different from a debt snowball, which is when a borrower pays down the smallest debt first.
How Debt Avalanches Work

Paying off your debts can be a daunting task, especially when you're faced with multiple debts, high balances, and sky-high interest rates. Making only the minimum monthly payments each month can make the process seem even more overwhelming, as the majority of your payments go toward interest rather than the principal balance.

This is why it's important to have a strategy in place that will help you become debt-free. Using the debt avalanche strategy is just one possibility. This tactic allows you to concentrate on the debts with the highest rates first. You can then target the one with the second-highest rate until you're left with the one that charges the lowest rate.

The debt avalanche allows you to focus on lowering the debt you have by paying less interest over time. Here's how you should structure the strategy:

The first step in starting a debt avalanche strategy is to make a list of all the debts you owe along with the individual interest rate for each.
Next, designate an amount of your available monthly income to pay debts. This amount should come from any funds not currently obligated for living and household expenses like rent, grocery, daycare, or transportation. 
Make a lump-sum payment (above the minimum required payment) to the debt with the highest interest rate. Ensure that the payment is significant but within your means.
Continue making minimum payments on your other obligations until the highest debt is paid off.
Move on to the debt with the next highest interest rate until all your debts are clear.

This strategy takes time, so it's important to be patient and not lose your focus.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

There are benefits and drawbacks that you must weigh out before you begin tackling your debts using this strategy. We've highlighted some of the key pros and cons of using a debt avalanche strategy to pay off your debts below.

Advantages of Debt Avalanches

The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it reduces the total interest you pay in the long term. Interest adds to your debts because most lenders use compound interest. The accrual rate depends on the frequency of compounding—the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest.

A debt avalanche repayment strategy also reduces the amount of time it will take you to get out of debt—assuming you make consistent payments—because less interest accumulates.


If you find yourself overburdened with debt, consider speaking to a financial professional or an organization that specializes in debt relief. Investopedia has a list of debt relief companies that may be able to help you out.

Disadvantages of Debt Avalanches

One of the main disadvantages of using the debt avalanche as a repayment strategy is that it only targets interest rates rather than balances. As such, you may not necessarily put a dent in the debt with the highest balance as it only receives the minimum payment. This can be daunting and cause you to feel like you're not making any progress.

The debt avalanche method requires discipline for consistency, which can be a downside for some people. Even with the best intentions of sticking with the debt-avalanche system, you may revert to making minimum payments on all the debts, especially if your financial situation changes. That’s why most financial planners recommend to first save up a six-month emergency fund before attempting any accelerated debt payoff plan.


Pros

Reduces total interest paid

Less time spent getting out of debt

Cons

Targets interest rates rather than (high) balances

Requires discipline and consistency

Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

The debt avalanche is different from the debt snowball. This is another accelerated debt payoff plan that requires a focused, dedicated approach.

With the debt snowball strategy, the debtor uses money beyond the minimum payments to pay off debts with the lowest balance first before moving on to the one(s) with the largest outstanding balance.

This means that you'll pay more than the minimum payment on the debt with the lowest balance until it's paid in full. You'll then move on to the next smallest debt until you eventually reach the one with the highest balance. As with the debt avalanche, you must continue making the minimum payments on the other debts as you paid down the smallest one in the bunch.

Although the debt snowball method doesn't save as much as the debt avalanche in terms of total interest charges, it can be a better strategy for staying motivated by eliminating small debts more quickly.

Most credit card balances compound interest daily, but there are loans where the interest can compound monthly, semiannually, or annually.

Example of a Debt Avalanche

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a debt avalanche works. Let's imagine you have $500 available every month (after you factor in your living expenses) to put toward paying down your debt. Say your current loans include:

$1,000 on a credit card with a 26% annual percentage rate (APR)
$1,250 on a personal loan with a 12% APR
$5,000 line of credit (LOC) with an 8% interest rate

For simplicity’s sake, assume each debt has a minimum monthly payment of $50. You would need to allot $150 toward paying each loan's minimum monthly payment ($50 x 3). The remaining $350 would also be put toward your credit card, the highest-interest debt. After the credit card balance is cleared, you would put the extra money toward the personal loan until it's paid off. Finally, you would put all $500 toward your line of credit, which has the smallest interest rate.

What Is the Difference Between the Debt Avalanche and the Debt Snowball?

The debt avalanche method involves paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first. With the debt snowball method, you focus on putting your extra money toward your smallest debt first. The advantage of the debt avalanche method is that it saves more in interest in the long term, while the benefit of the debt snowball method is that it can be more motivating.

What Is the Disadvantage of Debt Avalanche?

The major disadvantage of the debt avalanche method can be seen in cases where your highest-interest debt is also your largest debt. If you start putting your extra money toward paying down this debt first, you may save money on interest, but you may not feel like you're making strides toward paying down the loan.

What Is an Example of Debt Avalanche?

For this example of a debt avalanche, say you have three credit cards and are carrying balances on each. The first credit card has a $600 balance with an APR of 24%, the second has a $1,000 balance with an APR of 26%, and the third has a $1,200 balance with an APR of 19%. Using this method, you would first pay down the second credit card because it has the highest interest rate.

The Bottom Line

Whether the debt avalanche or the debt snowball method is the best strategy for paying off debt will depend on your financial situation. Using the debt avalanche method will save you the most money in interest in the long term, but some people find more success with the debt snowball method, which can be more motivating because you'll pay off smaller debts sooner.

Pros and Cons Explained
Pros
Relatively low debt settlement fees: Pacific Debt Relief’s fees are on the low end of the 28 debt settlement services we researched, at a minimum of 15% and a maximum of 25% of the amount of settled debt.
Excellent customer reviews: Pacific Debt Relief has excellent reviews from clients on both Trustpilot (4.8/5 stars) and the Better Business Bureau (4.93/5).12 Many debt settlement companies have lower ratings, so its strong customer support makes Pacific Debt Relief stand out from competitors.
Charges fees based on settled debt: Unlike some other debt settlement companies, Pacific charges fees based on the percentage of settled debt, rather than the initial debt you start the program with. This can save you money compared to a company that charges based on the initial debt (which is a larger amount).
Cons
Not available in all states: Pacific Debt Relief only serves residents in 29 states and the District of Columbia. It serves residents in the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
Higher-than-usual debt minimum: To qualify for debt settlement with Pacific Debt Relief, you must have $10,000 or more in unsecured debt. Some other companies have lower debt minimums.
Does not offer other services: As a debt settlement company, Pacific Debt Relief doesn't help with other areas of finance. For example, if you want to meet with a counselor to discuss budgeting, take homeownership classes, or attend workshops on building credit, you'll need to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency instead.
How Pacific Debt Relief Works

Pacific Debt Relief specializes in debt settlement. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to settle an outstanding debt for less than is owed. Debt settlement companies negotiate with creditors on behalf of their clients.

Depending on your situation and your creditors, debt settlement could slash your outstanding debt by a significant amount. 

As with other debt settlement companies, there are no upfront fees. Pacific Debt Relief only makes money once it has negotiated a settlement and the first settlement payment is made. 

 

Debt settlement can be risky. The fees can be expensive, there's no guarantee your creditors will agree to settle the outstanding debt, and the process can significantly damage your credit.3

Accreditations

Pacific Debt Relief is accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI). The International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA) also certifies it.

How to Enroll With Pacific Debt Relief

To get started with Pacific Debt Relief, follow these steps.

Set up a free consultation: Contact customer support via phone or email to arrange a free debt consultation. The representative will review your outstanding debt and finances to determine if you're a good candidate for a debt settlement agreement. 
Sign the agreement: Review the agreement, paying particular attention to the monthly amount you have to deposit in a savings account to build a settlement fund and the fees you'll have to pay Pacific Debt Relief if it successfully negotiates a settlement. If you agree to the terms, sign and return the agreement.
Pay the monthly amount: You’ll have to stop making your existing creditor payments. Instead, pay the agreed monthly amount into the dedicated debt settlement savings account. Pacific Debt Relief will begin negotiations for debt settlement once the account has grown large enough to entice creditors with a lump-sum payoff.
Types of Debt Addressed

Pacific Debt Relief provides debt settlement services for unsecured debt, like credit card balances. Other forms of debt, such as secured debt like mortgages or car loans, aren't eligible for debt settlement.

The following types of debt qualify for Pacific Debt Relief's program.

Unsecured Loans

Unsecured loans, such as personal loans, can qualify for debt settlement since they don't have collateral. 

Credit Card Debt

Credit card balances, including the balances on retail cards, are eligible for debt settlement.

Medical Bills

Outstanding medical bills from hospitals or clinics are usually eligible for debt settlement, as long as they aren't backed by collateral.

Expected Cost

Fees vary based on your enrolled debt and state of registration, but you can expect to pay 15% to 25% of your settled debt. This fee is factored into your monthly payment amount.

 

Debt settlement companies like Pacific Debt Relief cannot legally charge you any fees before they settle your debt.4

Expected Relief Amount

Pacific Debt Relief cannot guarantee results, nor can any other debt settlement company. But Pacific claims it can help customers reduce up to 50% of their credit card debt. The amount you save depends on your balances owed, the money in your settlement account, and the willingness of your creditors to accept a settlement.

Expected Time to Complete the Program

According to Pacific Debt Relief, its clients typically complete the program within 24 to 48 months. The program timeline depends on your enrolled balances and how much you can set aside each month for a settlement fund.

Additional Services

Pacific Debt Relief only provides debt settlement services. If you don't meet its criteria for debt settlement, it may refer you to other companies, such as debt consolidation or credit repair firms.

 

If you pursue debt settlement, your creditors can still send your account to collections. You could be sued and, if the company wins, your wages could be garnished.

Is Debt Settlement Worth It? 

Debt settlement can be expensive, and it can significantly damage your credit. Whether it's worth the drawbacks depends on the type of debt you have, your balance, and the settlement Pacific Debt Relief can negotiate.

The company claims it can reduce your balance by as much as 50%, but there is no guarantee of success. Before contacting Pacific Debt Relief or another company, consider other debt relief options. Depending on your situation, a debt management plan through credit counseling, a repayment strategy like the debt snowball or avalanche, or even bankruptcy may be a better choice. 

Is Debt Relief Through Debt Settlement Taxable?

Yes, debt relief through debt settlement is taxable. If Pacific Debt Relief is successful in negotiating your debt to be repaid to an amount less than you owe, you won't only have to pay the company a fee. You also need to plan for taxes: Canceled or settled debt is taxable as income, and it needs to be reported on your tax return.5

The Bottom Line

Pacific Debt Relief may be effective in negotiating a settlement for your outstanding credit card balances or other unsecured debt. But be aware: The company's fees are typically 15% to 25% of your settled debt, and your credit score could decrease drastically during the process. 

Debt settlement should be considered only after weighing the advantages and drawbacks of other approaches.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is Pacific Debt Relief Legit?

Pacific Debt Relief is a legitimate company based out of San Diego. The debt relief firm has been in business since 2002, is accredited by the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators, and has been accredited by the Better Business Bureau since 2010.

How Much Does Pacific Debt Relief Cost?

Pacific Debt Relief charges 15% to 25% of a customer's initial debt, which is typical for the debt relief industry. The company’s fees are paid only after a settlement has been successfully reached and paid.

Does Pacific Debt Relief Hurt Your Credit?

With Pacific Debt Relief, as with any debt settlement company, you must stop making any payments to your creditors while the company negotiates on your behalf. Your creditors will report missed payments to credit bureaus. Those late payments and delinquent accounts can significantly harm your credit score, although the money you save through debt settlement may be worth the price.

Who Is Eligible for Pacific Debt Relief?

To qualify for Pacific Debt Relief's debt settlement program, you must live in one of the states it operates in and have at least $10,000 of outstanding debt. Pacific Debt Relief only works with unsecured debt, like credit cards and personal signature loans; secured debts, such as car loans, aren't eligible. 

How We Determine the Best Debt Relief Companies

To determine the best debt relief companies, we reviewed various databases, competitive analyses, consumer behavior, and more, ultimately narrowing down the list to 40 companies that offered debt settlement and/or credit counseling services. We developed a quantitative model in which we identified 53 important criteria across five categories. We weighted each category as follows for this article:

Costs and fees: 41.00%
Availability: 22.50%
Reputation and stability: 19.00%
Customer experience: 9.50%
Services: 8.00%

We then gathered data for the 53 criteria directly from companies via websites, media contacts, and existing partnerships. Data was collected between Oct. 19, 2023 and Dec. 18, 2023. This resulted in over 2,000 data points in our rubric, which we used to score and determine the best debt relief companies (including debt settlement and credit counseling services) for people looking to manage and get out of debt.

Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt. We’ll go over the costs for five popular debt relief options: debt settlement, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt payoff apps, and bankruptcy.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Debt settlement companies: Often 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Many services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and—for balance transfer credit cards—balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, although there is much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1

Investopedia / Zoe Hansen

The term “debt relief” often refers to debt settlement companies, but it’s also used as an umbrella term to describe just about anything meant to help ease the financial strain from debt. Many types of loans have specific debt relief options, such as recasting a mortgage or the different income-driven payment plans available for federal student loans. When it comes to anything other than simple unsecured debt (like personal loans and credit cards), it’s best to research the specific debt and contact your lender for assistance. 

Costs of Debt Settlement

Debt settlement companies are usually the first results to pop up in Google if you search for debt relief. These companies seem to have large marketing budgets and plenty of allure. Who wouldn’t want to settle their debt for less than they owed, especially considering there are no upfront fees?2

Unfortunately, the costs of debt settlement aren’t always obvious. These companies require you to stop paying your debts entirely, instead paying into a third-party savings account. They’ll use this money as a bargaining chip to negotiate a lump-sum settlement payment for less than you owe—but this means you’ll end up defaulting on your debt. As you might expect, this can be very costly in the long run.

Debt settlement companies start with a free consultation to go over your financial situation and your credit. This gives you a chance to learn about the company and what it can do for you, but don’t be surprised if the representative tries to sell you the service.

Now, let’s consider the direct fees for debt settlement:

Settlement fees: These fees range from 14% to 30% of your debt, but they’re only paid on debts that the company successfully negotiates. Some debt settlement companies base this fee on the amount of settled debt, while others base it on the amount of enrolled debt (again, only concerning accounts that are settled; if the company can’t negotiate one of your debts, you wouldn’t pay fees for that debt).
Monthly account fees: You may be charged a setup and/or monthly fee for the third-party savings account that debt settlement companies require you to use to build up your lump sum payment.

More importantly, the indirect costs of debt settlement include:

Income taxes: You’ll generally be required to pay taxes on the amount of debt your creditors forgive when you file your taxes at the end of the year.3 Depending on your tax bracket, that could amount to 10% to 37% (in 2024) of the amount that your creditors forgave.4
Credit damage: Creditors will report late payments, defaults, collections, and debt settlements on your credit reports, which can cause serious damage to your credit. A closed, delinquent account will generally stay on your credit reports for seven years.5
Late payment fees: Creditors will charge late payment fees, which can cause the amount you owe to increase while you’re not making payments on your debt. These fees add to your balance and can be included in settlements, but if the debt settlement company isn’t successful, you’ll owe all those extra fees, too.
Unsuccessful debt settlement: Although old, one 2007 Federal Trade Commission analysis found that only about half of people successfully completed a debt relief and settlement program.6 People who don’t complete the program can end up with worse credit and in more debt than they started with.

If you’re considering debt settlement, it’s important to work with a trustworthy company that doesn’t charge extra-high fees. See the best debt relief companies to explore our top picks.

Costs of Credit Counseling

Credit counseling is a broad term that refers to any support you get from a dedicated credit counseling organization, most of which are nonprofit. These organizations assign a counselor to work with you one-on-one, going over your financial situation and debt profile. They can help you decide on the best way to alleviate your debt burden—including secured debt such as mortgages and student loans—and may even contact your creditors on your behalf.

Credit counseling agencies also offer debt management plans (DMPs), working with your creditors to modify your debts so they’re more affordable (these plans may only be available for unsecured debts). The agency may be able to negotiate lower interest rates and/or lower monthly payments for debts in the DMP. You’ll send in one monthly payment to the agency until all of the debts included in the DMP are paid off in full, which typically takes three to five years.7

Most services provided by credit counselors are free (including your initial consultation), unless you sign up for a debt management plan.8 Fees for a DMP may be based on the customer’s income. Here are the associated costs of the major players in the industry, according to Investopedia research:

Debt management plan setup fee: $0 to $99
Debt management plan monthly fee: $0 to $75

You typically need to close any credit cards you enroll in a DMP. And, although credit counseling and debt management plans don’t have a negative effect on your credit score themselves, canceling your credit cards may bring your score down. Your credit reports may also show accounts in DMPs, and lenders can see that information.

Costs of Debt Consolidation/Refinance

Consolidating your debt can be a good option if you have a decent handle on your finances already, and you’re just looking to save some money or get a more manageable payment. You can consolidate multiple accounts into a single monthly payment, or just refinance a single debt account.

Debt consolidation usually takes two forms: taking out a personal loan for a lower interest rate and/or a different term length, or opening a new 0% APR balance transfer credit card featuring a months-long interest-free runway to help you get ahead of your debt.

If you get a lower rate, you can save money over time. If you get a longer repayment period, you may get some breathing room with a lower monthly payment—but this can make the debt more expensive overall.

Here are the costs you can expect to pay for a personal loan:

Loan interest: Loans charge interest from the start, albeit at a lower overall rate on average than credit cards (unless you get a 0% APR credit card).9
Origination fees: Loans often come with origination fees ranging from 1% to 6% or more, especially if you don’t have good or excellent credit.

And here are the main costs for a balance transfer credit card:

Annual fees: Balance transfer cards may come with annual fees, which are sometimes waived in the first year. The best cards don’t charge such a fee, however.
Balance transfer fees: Most balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee, typically ranging from 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.
Credit card interest: A 0% APR balance transfer card will start charging interest at the end of the 0% intro period, giving you a good incentive to pay down as much as you can during the interim. It’s also possible to lose your 0% rate if you miss a payment. And, if you make any purchases with the card, that spending will accrue interest at the purchase APR (which may or may not be 0%).

The cost for you depends on your personal credit and the overall interest rate environment to a large extent. If you’re in a low-interest-rate environment and you have excellent credit already, you’ll likely qualify for very inexpensive loans and credit cards. If you have bad credit and/or rates are high all around, it may be hard to find options for less than you’re already paying. 

If you don’t qualify for a 0% APR balance transfer, you may still be able to transfer a balance to a credit card—but it probably won’t be a cost-saving move, because normal credit card rates tend to be relatively high.9

Costs of Debt Payoff Apps

Anyone can use debt payoff apps to help manage or get ahead on their debt, even if they’re not currently struggling. There are many types of apps and they work differently. Two popular types are debt planners and round-up apps.

Debt payoff planners help you calculate the best way to pay down your debt (such as with the debt avalanche or debt snowball method), while round-up apps link up with your debit or credit cards to round up each purchase you make to the nearest dollar. That difference gets saved up and periodically sent to your lender as an extra payment to help you make quicker debt payoff progress.

Here are a few examples of debt payoff apps, along with their costs.

App	How It Works	Cost
Undebt.it	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $12/year for premium subscription
Debt Payoff Planner	Create a debt payoff plan and monitor your progress	Free, or $2/month for premium subscription

Bright Money	Create an automated financial plan, including round-ups to pay down debt faster	$10/month–$89/year
Debt Payoff Assistant	Very basic debt snowball planning tool	Free
Costs of Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is the last resort for many people, allowing them to discharge many common debts in court. There are two main types of bankruptcy you can file: Chapter 7, where you sell most of your assets to pay off your debt (barring certain exemptions that vary by state, which can include your house), and Chapter 13, which allows you to make payments for three or five years.10

After you complete the requirements of your particular bankruptcy type, you’ll be free of those debts. Here are the costs you can expect to pay along the way:

Court costs: You’ll typically need to pay over $300 to file various documents with your local bankruptcy court (fee waivers or installment payments are sometimes accepted).
Attorney fees: Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,000—or more—to hire an attorney.
Credit counseling/debtor education course fees: Those who file bankruptcy must enroll in credit counseling and debtor education courses. The price for each course is capped at $50, although you’ll often pay less than half of that.1

Unlike debt settlement, you generally won’t owe a large tax bill on any debts that are discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.11 It still comes with a few other drawbacks that you should know about, however:

Credit damage: Bankruptcy stays on your credit reports for up to 10 years.12 During that period, it may be difficult for you to get approved for credit, utilities, and even rental housing. The severity of the negative effects decreases over time, however.
Social stigma: People who file for bankruptcy may be treated poorly by others, even if the debt wasn’t their fault in the first place.

Still, the benefits of discharging an overwhelming amount of debt may be worth the cost.

If you’re considering bankruptcy, chances are you don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. But there are ways to get help paying for an attorney. “In many cases, those who are filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy—or ‘liquidation’ bankruptcy—will stop paying their debt bills and use those funds to pay for legal help,” said Leslie Tayne, founder and head debt relief attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C. “In other situations, lawyers may offer a payment plan or some other billing situation that makes sense for a person’s financial situation.”

Don’t forget to look up free legal aid clinics and support available in your area, especially if you’re on a limited income or from an underserved community.

When Should You Seek Debt Relief?

There aren’t any hard and fast rules about when you should seek out debt relief. However, most experts agree you should consider it if you’re in debt and are having trouble making ends meet, especially if you’ve tried DIY solutions. 

“There are debt relief options for just about anyone who owes money,” said Tayne. “Generally, though, once you know there’s an issue with keeping up on payments, that’s the best time to look for a debt relief option.”

It can be wise to let your lender know when (or before) you have trouble paying, because some offer hardship programs to help you meet your obligations. And credit counseling services offer free consultations, so there’s little harm in trying. A credit counselor may be able to help you figure out which method is right for your situation.

Other options you can try before—or alongside—debt relief programs include:

Starting (or refining) a budget
Asking for help from family and friends
Cutting expenses and increasing income

The average household was $23,317 in the red, excluding mortgage debt, in the second quarter of 2023.13 That kind of debt can add unhealthy stress to your life, making it harder to make ends meet and get ahead in life.

The Bottom Line

You should take the time to consider debt relief costs when deciding on the best option for your financial situation. However, there are sometimes ways to get help paying, even for expensive options like bankruptcy. 

Factoring in the costs is certainly important, but in many cases, it’s better to focus on the method that’s most likely to help you get out of debt in the long run while doing the least amount of damage in the meantime. For that, you’ll need to consider other factors too, such as your relationship with money, your credit, your behaviors, relevant state laws, your family situation, future financial goals, and more. 

Do Debt Relief Companies Charge a Fee?

Generally, yes; most types of debt relief companies charge some type of fee, although some options are free. Here’s a quick rundown of the costs you can expect, according to Investopedia research:

Debt settlement companies: Typically 14% to 30% of your debt
Credit counseling agencies: Certain services are free, but a debt management plan typically costs from $0 to $35 to set up, with a monthly fee ranging from $0 to $75. 
Debt consolidation loans and credit cards: Interest fees, origination fees, and for balance transfer cards, balance transfer fees
Debt payoff apps: $0 to around $90 per year, with much variability
Bankruptcy: $400 to $3,000 or more1
How Does Debt Relief Affect Your Credit?

Different debt relief methods have different effects on your credit. Debt payoff apps, credit counseling, and debt management plans don’t have any direct impact on your credit score.14 At the other end of the extreme, bankruptcy and debt settlement have the potential to cause severe damage to your credit that can take years to overcome.

How Long Does Debt Relief Last?

Depending on the type of debt relief program you choose, it could be very quick or take a long time. If you’re just looking for help in making your payments, consolidating your high-interest debt into one personal loan can sometimes be completed in a day. On the other hand, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan can take up to five years to complete.12

Is Debt Relief Worth It?

“In general, if you take the time to research your options and choose a reputable organization or professional, the initial costs will be transparent from the get-go and well worth the savings and relief you get as a result,” said Tayne. To ensure you’re happy with your decision, it’s important to compare all your options and research the full range of costs, including indirect ones such as taxes owed on settled debt. 

How Much Debt Is Too Much?

If you’re having trouble making your monthly payments, you have too much debt. A more specific number to keep in mind, especially for would-be homebuyers, is a debt-to-income ratio of 43%; above this mark, most lenders won’t approve you for a conventional mortgage.15 Some debt-averse people are more concerned about the total amount of their debt. By paying down their debt faster they may be able to sleep better at night, even if their monthly payments are currently manageable. "
best practices for creating an emergency fund,investopedia,How to Build Generational Wealth,Help your heirs benefit from your success by building a strong financial foundation that includes an estate plan and maximizes tax savings.,https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-build-generational-wealth-8417999,"Generational wealth refers to assets passed down from one generation to the next. Building generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and opportunities for your children, grandchildren, and beyond.

Generational wealth is about more than just financial resources, according to Taylor Kovar, certified financial planner (CFP) and CEO of 11 Financial in Lufkin, Texas. “Its value extends beyond the monetary aspect—it’s also about imparting enduring family values and wisdom, creating a legacy that benefits and shapes the lives of future generations,” he said.

Learn more about why generational wealth is important, how to lay the foundations to build wealth for your family, and how to ensure that your legacy is passed on in the most efficient way.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Generational wealth refers to passing down assets from one generation to the next.
Before you can build generational wealth, you must create a strong financial foundation by prioritizing savings, growing an emergency fund, and thinking through future plans.
Generational wealth can provide long-term financial security and open opportunities for your children and beyond.
Strategies for building generational wealth include investing in education, financial markets, and real estate, and creating and preserving assets.
Maximizing tax benefits and avoiding debt are crucial for building generational wealth.
The Importance of Building Generational Wealth

Achieving financial success takes a lot of hard work, sacrifice, and planning. Not only can it help you enjoy things in your lifetime, but it can also help your heirs reap the benefits of your legacy and enjoy a financially secure lifestyle after you’re gone.

Think of it as a wealth snowball. For example, generational wealth paves the way for enhanced educational opportunities and, consequently, greater earning potential for your kids, according to Kovar. And then they can continue building upon that foundation for their kids (your grandkids).

The Challenges of Building Generational Wealth 

Building generational wealth is not an easy undertaking, but it’s especially challenging if you grow up in poverty or face systemic barriers. Unfortunately, that has been the experience of many marginalized groups in this country.

For instance, in 2019, the median wealth of White families was 6.5 times that of Black families, 5.5 times that of Hispanic families, and 2.7 times that of Asian and other families, according to the Congressional Budget Office.1

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, data from the St. Louis Fed showed that Black families owned about 23 cents for every $1 of White family wealth, on average. Hispanic families owned about 19 cents for every $1 of White family wealth.2 

Contributing to this racial wealth gap is the fact that Black Americans are less likely to own a home, which is one of the major ways that people pass on wealth.3 The underlying reason for this is, in part, systemic discriminatory practices in home selling, home lending, and appraisals that have been well-documented in recent decades.

Black Americans and other marginalized groups have also historically had less access to banking and financial services and lower credit scores, which has locked them out of various investment opportunities.

If building generational wealth is a goal of yours, there are a few financial moves you can make that can help you achieve this.

Build a Strong Financial Foundation

Building generational wealth is as much about setting a strong example as it is about making the right financial decisions. You can model the building blocks of healthy personal finances to your family, which includes the following best practices.

Prioritize Savings

“It’s not how much you make, but how much you keep. That’s the key to accumulating savings and wealth,” says J.B. Beckett, founder of Beckett Financial Group in West Columbia, South Carolina.

Many people fall into the trap of saying they’ll save what’s left over at the end of the month but never end up getting around to it, or they spend beyond their means. A better approach is to create a budget to control your spending so that you have guaranteed funds available to save and set up an automatic payment to yourself each month.

Here’s how to get started:

Pick a percentage or dollar amount that you are able to allocate toward savings goals after your expenses are covered.
If you have more than one savings goal, create separate accounts for each one.
Consider a high-yield savings account that earns interest on top of your contributions.
Set up automatic payments to each savings account and watch them grow.

For longer-term savings goals, you might consider putting money in certificate of deposit (CD) accounts for a guaranteed return.

Build an Emergency Fund

One of the most important tools for building generational wealth is making sure that you have financial security in case of an emergency or loss of income. That’s where an emergency fund comes in.

Oftentimes, not having an emergency fund is what leads people into debt or causes them to cash out retirement accounts, which not only incurs penalties but also comes with a big opportunity cost.

Ultimately, you want to end up with enough money saved to cover a few months’ worth of expenses, but that will take some time to build up. In the interim, focus on making regular, automated contributions, and save more aggressively if you find ways to trim expenses or develop new income streams. Most important is that you avoid the temptation to withdraw money from the account—it must be reserved for true emergencies.

Involve Kids in Money Conversations

One often-overlooked aspect of building a strong financial foundation is involving your family, and children specifically, in the conversation. This way, they can understand financial basics from a young age, alongside you.

Kevin M. Curley II, certified financial planner and financial advisor at Global Wealth Advisors in Dallas, Texas, recommends including children in the family finances from a young age through fun and games.

“Play Monopoly and teach them poker at the kitchen table,” Curley says. “Consider giving them an allowance and discuss how they plan to spend it. Later, let them invest a small amount in their favorite video game designer or cosmetics manufacturer and track wins and losses together.”

Invest in Education

Once you’ve made some progress on your emergency fund, you can allocate some of your discretionary income toward other big financial goals. A popular one is to save for your children’s education. If you’re aiming to build generational wealth, you can think of college savings for your kids as an investment in their future earning power.

That’s because degree attainment is directly correlated with an increase in lifetime earnings—in the millions, as a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found. According to the study, someone with a high school diploma can expect to earn $1.3 million over a lifetime; a bachelor’s degree holder will earn $2.3 million; a master’s degree can lead to $2.7 million in lifetime earnings; and a professional degree holder can earn $3.6 million.4

Note

Of course, the costs of education are continuing to rise, and it may not be the best option for everyone. It’s best to take a comprehensive look at your financial situation and life goals before deciding to invest in education.

Consider opening a 529 plan, which is a tax-advantaged account that is tax-free when used for eligible educational expenses.5 

Invest in Financial Markets

To build wealth in a meaningful way, the sooner you get started, the better. “Starting early and consistently saving, even in smaller amounts, can lead to significant growth over time, thanks to the power of compound interest,” Kovar says.

While investing in the stock market comes with some risk, if you diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, you can balance risk with growth potential. One popular strategy for beginners is to invest in index funds, which is a collection of many stocks designed to mimic the performance of major market indexes like the S&P 500.

The key to investing in the stock market is to think of it in the long term by riding out the downturns since, historically, it usually bounces back.

Invest in Real Estate

Another popular investment avenue to explore is real estate, thanks to its potential rental income and appreciation in property value. Plus, it’s a strong investment to pass on to your next of kin.

“Exploring various property types, from residential to commercial, can diversify your real estate portfolio,” Kovar says.

If you’re not ready for that level of investment or don’t want the commitment of running a property, Beckett suggests looking into real estate investment trusts (REITs).

Create and Preserve Assets

Building wealth is just step one in creating generational wealth. The next part is making sure that your assets are protected so that they remain available to pass on to future generations. You also want your heirs to be able to retain as much of their inheritance (if relevant) as possible, which is why tax implications come into play.

To ensure your children are protected and set up in the best possible way financially, consider the following actions.

Build an Estate Plan

As your assets grow and become more complex, working with financial professionals and attorneys on estate planning is the smart move. Some considerations include:

Creating a business that you can pass down 
Considering life insurance. “Life insurance is one of the most tax-efficient vehicles to pass on wealth,” Beckett says.
Making sure other insurance needs are met. Make sure you’re covered in case of a catastrophic event involving your home, car, or a medical event. If not, one incident or lawsuit could wipe out your savings.
Maximize Tax Benefits

A number of tax-efficient investing strategies and vehicles can help you retain a greater share of your returns. Some strategies include:

Tax-deferred accounts: Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, offering you an upfront tax break as you invest. You pay taxes when you withdraw your money in retirement.67
Tax-exempt accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are tax-exempt when you withdraw, since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.8
Health savings accounts (HSAs): You contribute tax-free and enjoy tax-free growth. Then, if used for eligible medical expenses, money comes out tax-free, too.9

Work with a tax accountant or financial advisor to learn what strategies are best for you, and ultimately shield the most money from taxes as possible.

Avoid Debt and Financial Pitfalls

Living within your means and having a healthy emergency fund are the two best ways to avoid unnecessary, high-interest debt like high credit card balances. Those types of borrowing costs can prevent you from making progress on your savings and wealth-building goals.

If you do have some debt to contend with, prioritize paying your highest-interest accounts, while still maintaining your contributions to your emergency fund and retirement accounts (though it’s OK to scale back temporarily). Try to use any windfalls of money such as tax returns or monetary gifts to pay off large chunks when those opportunities become available. 

How to Pass Down Generational Wealth

The last aspect of generational wealth is making sure it goes where you want it to go. This involves getting your wishes documented legally. At a very basic level, you can start with a will. But as finances get more complex, you’ll want to go beyond that, according to Curley.

Beckett recommends setting up a trust. “A trust can be efficient for bypassing probate if it’s set up properly,” he says. “And it’s private. If it’s in a trust, it’s not public record.”

Once you have your affairs in order, keep the lines of communication open with your family, letting them know your plans and how to access your documents. This is beneficial on the off chance that a sudden emergency happens and your family needs to take over the financial plans.

How Can I Start Building Generational Wealth If I Have Limited Financial Resources?

Take it one small step at a time. Create a budget that allows you to allocate money toward savings each month. Make lifestyle choices that help fuel your financial goals. And invest in your retirement as early as possible to give it time to grow.

What Are Some Tax-Efficient Strategies for Maximizing Generational Wealth?

There are many tax-efficient strategies that you may consider adopting, such as investing in tax-deferred accounts or Health Savings Accounts. The route you choose to go will depend on your own personal financial situation, so you may want to work with a tax professional or financial advisor. Plus, these individuals can help you stay current with any new tax rules as they are established.

How Can I Protect My Assets and Ensure They Are Passed Down to Future Generations?

Making sure you’re properly insured (through home, auto, and life insurance) and working with an estate planner are the two best ways to protect your assets. In addition, be sure you at least have a will, and consider establishing a trust.

The Bottom Line

If you’re a first-generation wealth builder, committing to taking those first steps of saving money, building an emergency fund, and starting to invest for the long term and following through with consistency will eventually pay off.

Though it might take some sacrifice upfront, building generational wealth has both short- and long-term benefits that make it worth the effort. In your lifetime, you’ll get to enjoy the peace of mind of knowing that your loved ones will be well taken care of financially. You can also share your knowledge and insights with your children and grandchildren to help instill strong financial habits that can help them keep the family legacy strong for the next generation."

Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax, and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.

Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfill those needs within your financial constraints—also impact how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial decisions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Few schools have courses on managing your money, so it is important to learn how through free online articles, courses, blogs, podcasts, or books.
The core areas of managing personal finance include income, spending, savings, investments, and protection.
Smart personal finance involves developing strategies that include budgeting, creating an emergency fund, paying off debt, using credit cards wisely, saving for retirement, and much more.
Being disciplined is important, but it’s also good to know when you shouldn't adhere to the guidelines.

The Importance of Personal Finance

Personal finance is about meeting your personal financial goals. These goals could be anything—having enough for short-term financial needs, planning for retirement, or saving for your child’s college education. It depends on your income, spending, saving, investing, and personal protection (insurance and estate planning).

Not understanding how to manage finances or be financially disciplined has led Americans to accumulate enormous debt. In August 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reported household debt had increased by $3.7 trillion since December 2019, prior to the recession. In addition, the following balances increased from the first quarter of 2024 to the second:1

Credit card balances: Up by $27 billion
Auto loans: Up by $10 billion
Consumer loans and store cards: Up by $1 billion
Total non-housing: Up by $28 billion
Mortgages: Up by $77 billion

Student loans remained unchanged, at about $1.6 trillion.

Americans are taking on an ever-increasing amount of debt to finance purchases, making managing personal finances more critical than ever, especially when inflation is eating away at purchasing power and prices are rising.


Areas of Personal Finance

The five areas of personal finance are income, saving, spending, investing, and protection.

Income

Income is the starting point of personal finance. It is the entire amount of cash inflow that you receive and can allocate to expenses, savings, investments, and protection. Income is all the money you bring in. This includes salaries, wages, dividends, and other sources of cash inflow.

Spending

Spending is an outflow of cash and typically where the bulk of income goes. Spending is whatever an individual uses their income to buy. This includes rent, mortgage, groceries, hobbies, eating out, home furnishings, home repairs, travel, and entertainment.

Being able to manage spending is a critical aspect of personal finance. Individuals must ensure their spending is less than their income; otherwise, they won't have enough money to cover their expenses or will fall into debt. Debt can be devastating financially, particularly with the high-interest rates credit cards charge.

Saving

Savings is the income left over after spending. Everyone should aim to have savings to cover large expenses or emergencies. However, this means not using all your income, which can be difficult. Regardless of the difficulty, everyone should strive to have at least a portion of savings to meet any fluctuations in income and spending—somewhere between three and 12 months of expenses.

Beyond that, cash idling in a savings account becomes wasteful because it loses purchasing power to inflation over time. Instead, cash not tied up in an emergency or spending account should be placed in something that will help it maintain its value or grow, such as investments.

Investing

Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested. Investing aims to increase an individual's wealth beyond the amount they invested. Investing does come with risks, as not all assets appreciate and can incur a loss.

Investing can be difficult for those unfamiliar with it—it helps to dedicate some time to gain an understanding through readings and studying. If you don't have time, you might benefit from hiring a professional to help you invest your money.

Protection

Protection refers to the methods people take to protect themselves from unexpected events, such as illnesses or accidents, and as a means to preserve wealth. Protection includes life and health insurance and estate and retirement planning.

Personal Finance Services

Several financial planning services fall under one or more of the five areas. You're likely to find many businesses that provide these services to clients to help them plan and manage their finances. These services include:

Wealth Management
Loans and Debt
Budgeting
Retirement
Taxes
Risk Management
Estate Planning
Investments
Insurance
Credit Cards
Home and Mortgage
Personal Finance Strategies

The sooner you start financial planning, the better, but it’s never too late to create financial goals to give yourself and your family financial security and freedom. Here are the best practices and tips for personal finance.

The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey surveyed 4,000 adults and found that most Americans are concerned about personal finance basics, retirement funding, and investing in crypto.

1. Know Your income

It's all for nothing if you don't know how much you bring home after taxes and withholding. So before deciding anything, ensure you know exactly how much take-home pay you receive.

2. Devise a Budget

A budget is essential to living within your means and saving enough to meet your long-term goals. The 50/30/20 budgeting method offers a great framework. It breaks down like this:

Fifty percent of your take-home pay or net income (after taxes) goes toward living essentials, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transport.
Thirty percent is allocated to discretionary expenses, such as dining out and shopping for clothes. Giving to charity can go here as well.
Twenty percent goes toward the future—paying down debt and saving for retirement and emergencies.

It’s never been easier to manage money, thanks to a growing number of smartphone personal budgeting apps that put day-to-day finances in the palm of your hand. Here are just two examples:

YNAB (You Need a Budget) helps you track and adjust your spending to control every dollar you spend.
PocketGuard is available in both free and paid versions. It uses an algorithm to help you avoid overspending by analyzing your income, bills, goals, and budget.
3. Pay Yourself First

It’s important to “pay yourself first” to ensure money is set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, a significant car repair, day-to-day expenses if you get laid off, and more. The ideal safety net is three to 12 months of living expenses.

Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. Once you’ve filled up your emergency fund, don’t stop. Continue funneling the monthly 20% toward other financial goals, such as a retirement fund or a down payment on a home.

4. Limit and Reduce Debt

It sounds simple enough: Don't spend more than you earn to keep debt from getting out of hand. But, of course, most people have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous—for example, if it leads to acquiring an asset. Taking out a mortgage to buy a house might be one such case. Still, leasing sometimes can be more economical than buying outright, whether renting a property, leasing a car, or even getting a subscription to computer software.

On the other hand, minimizing repayments (to interest only, for instance) can free up income to invest elsewhere or put into retirement savings while you’re young when your nest egg gets the maximum benefit from compounding interest. Some private and federal student loans are even eligible for a rate reduction if the borrower enrolls in auto pay.2

Student loans account for $1.59 trillion of consumer debt—if you have an outstanding student loan, you should prioritize it.1 There are myriad loan repayment plans and payment reduction strategies available. If you’re stuck with a high interest rate, paying off the principal faster can make sense.

Flexible federal repayment programs worth checking out include:3

Graduated repayment—progressively increases the monthly payment over 10 years
Extended repayment—stretches out the loan over a period that can be as long as 25 years
Income-driven repayment—limits payments to 10% to 20% of your income (based on your income and family size)
5. Only Borrow What You Can Repay

Credit cards can be major debt traps, but it’s unrealistic not to own any in the contemporary world. Furthermore, they have applications beyond buying things. They are crucial to establishing your credit rating and a great way to track spending, which can be a considerable budgeting aid.

Credit needs to be managed correctly, meaning you should pay off your entire balance every month or keep your credit utilization ratio at a minimum (that is, keep your account balances below 30% of your total available credit).4

Given the extraordinary reward and incentives offered these days (such as cashback), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible—if you can pay your bills in full.

Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs, and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your credit score is to constantly pay bills late—or even worse, miss payments.

Using a debit card, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.

6. Monitor Your Credit Score

Credit cards are the primary vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score. If you ever want to obtain a lease, mortgage, or any other type of financing, then you’ll need a solid credit report. There are a variety of credit scores available, but the most popular one is the FICO score.5

Factors that determine your FICO score include:6

Payment history (35%)
Amounts owed (30%)
Length of credit history (15%)
Credit mix (10%)
New credit (10%)

FICO scores are calculated from 300 to 850.7 Here’s how your credit is rated:8

Exceptional: 800 to 850
Very good: 740 to 799
Good: 670 to 739
Fair: 580 to 669
Poor: 579 and below

To pay bills, set up direct debiting where possible (so you never miss a payment) and subscribe to reporting agencies that provide regular credit score updates. In addition, you can detect and address mistakes or fraudulent activity by monitoring your credit report. Federal law allows you to obtain free credit reports once a year from the “Big Three” major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.9

Reports can be obtained directly from each agency, or you can sign up at AnnualCreditReport.com, a federally authorized site sponsored by the Big Three.

Some credit card providers, such as Capital One, will provide customers with complimentary, regular credit score updates, but it may not be your FICO score. Instead, Capital One's CreditWise program offers your VantageScore.10

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the three major credit bureaus are providing free credit reports weekly. The program was extended twice in 2022 and it is now permanent.11

7. Plan for Your Future

To protect the assets in your estate and ensure that your wishes are followed when you die, be sure you make a will and—depending on your needs—possibly set up one or more trusts. You also should look into insurance and find ways to reduce your premiums, if possible: auto, home, life, disability, and long-term care (LTC). Periodically review your policy to ensure it meets your family’s needs through life’s major milestones.

Other critical documents include a living will and a healthcare power of attorney. While not all of these documents directly affect you, all of them can save your next of kin considerable time and expense when you fall ill or become otherwise incapacitated.

Retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it arrives much sooner than expected. Experts suggest that most people will need about 80% of their current salary in retirement. The younger you start, the more you benefit from what advisors call the magic of compounding interest—how small amounts grow over time.

Setting aside money now for your retirement not only allows it to grow over the long term but also can reduce your current income taxes if funds are placed in a tax-advantaged plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a 403(b).

While your children are young, take the time to teach them about the value of money and how to save, invest, and spend wisely.

If your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, start paying into it immediately, especially if your employer matches your contribution. By not doing so, you’re giving up free money. Take time to learn the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) if your company offers both.

Investing is only one part of planning for retirement. Other strategies include waiting as long as possible before opting to receive Social Security benefits (which is smart for most people) and converting a term life insurance policy to permanent life.

8. Buy Insurance

As you age, it's natural for you to accumulate many of the same things your parents did—a family, home or apartment, belongings, and health issues. Insurance can be expensive if you wait too long to get it. Health care, long-term care insurance, life insurance; it all increases in cost the older you get. Additionally, you never know what life will send your way. If you're the sole breadwinner for the family, or you and your partner both work to make ends meet, a lot depends on your ability to work.

Insurance can cover most of the hospital bills as you age, leaving your hard-earned savings in your family's hands; medical expenses are one of the leading reasons for debt.12 If something happens to you, life insurance can give those you leave behind a buffer zone to deal with the loss and get back on their feet financially.

9. Maximize Tax Breaks

Due to an overly complex tax code, many people leave hundreds or even thousands of dollars sitting on the table every year. By maximizing your tax savings, you’ll free up money that can be invested in your reduction of past debts, enjoyment of the present, and plans for the future.

You should start saving receipts and tracking expenditures for all possible tax deductions and tax credits. Many office supply stores sell helpful “tax organizers” that have the main categories already labeled.

After you’re organized, you’ll want to focus on taking advantage of every tax deduction and credit available, as well as deciding between the two when necessary. In short, a tax deduction reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed, whereas a tax credit reduces the amount of tax that you owe. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will save you much more than a $1,000 deduction.13

10. Give Yourself a Break

Budgeting and planning can seem full of deprivations. Make sure you reward yourself now and then. Whether it’s a vacation, a purchase, or an occasional night on the town, you need to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Doing so gives you a taste of the financial independence you’re working so hard for.

Last but not least, don’t forget to delegate when needed. Even though you might be competent enough to do your own taxes or manage a portfolio of individual stocks, it doesn’t mean you should. Setting up an account at a brokerage and spending a few hundred dollars on a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner—at least once—might be a good way to jump-start your planning.

Personal Finance Skills

The key to getting your finances on the right track is using skills you likely already have. It’s also about understanding that the principles that contribute to success in business and your career work just as well in personal money management. Three key skills are finance prioritization, assessing the costs and benefits, and restraining your spending.

Finance Prioritization: This means that you can look at your finances, discern what keeps the money flowing in, and make sure that you stay focused on those efforts.
Assessing the Costs and Benefits: This key skill keeps professionals from spreading themselves too thin. Ambitious individuals always have a list of ideas about other ways that they can hit it big, whether it is a side business or an investment idea. While there is a place and time for taking a flier, running your finances like a business means stepping back and honestly assessing the potential costs and benefits of any new venture.
Restraining Your Spending: This is the final big-picture skill of successful business management that must be applied to personal finances. Time and again, financial planners sit down with successful people who still manage to spend more than they make. Earning $250,000 a year won’t do you much good if you spend $275,000 annually. Learning to restrain spending on non-wealth-building assets until after you’ve met your monthly savings or debt reduction goals is crucial in building net worth.
Personal Finance Education

Personal money management isn't one of the most popular topics in educational systems. Many college degrees require some financial education, but it isn't geared toward individuals, which means that most of us will need to get our personal finance education from our parents (if we’re lucky) or learn it ourselves.

Fortunately, you don’t have to spend much money to find out how to manage it better. You can learn everything you need to know for free online and in library books. Almost all media publications regularly dole out personal finance advice, too.

Online Blogs

Reading personal finance blogs is a great way to start learning about personal finance. Instead of the general advice you’ll get in personal finance articles, you’ll learn exactly which challenges real people face and how they address them.

Mr. Money Mustache has hundreds of posts full of insights on escaping the rat race and retiring early by making unconventional lifestyle choices. CentSai helps you navigate a myriad of financial decisions via first-person accounts. Million Mile Secrets and The Points Guy each teach you how to travel for a fraction of the retail price using credit card rewards. These sites often link to other blogs, so you’ll discover more sites as you read.

Of course, we can’t help tooting our own horn in this category. Investopedia offers a wealth of free personal finance education. You might start with our special sections on budgeting, buying a home, and planning for retirement—or the thousands of other articles in our personal finance section.

At the Library

You may need to visit your library in person to get a library card if you don’t already have one, but after that, you can check out personal finance audiobooks and e-books online without leaving home. Some of the following best sellers may be available from your local library: ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"" ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" ""Your Money or Your Life,"" and ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Personal finance classics such as Personal Finance for Dummies,"" ""The Total Money Makeover,"" ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,"" and ""Think and Grow Rich"" are also available as audiobooks.

Free Online Classes

If you enjoy the structure of lessons and quizzes, try one of these free digital personal finance courses:

Morningstar Investing Classroom offers a place for beginning and experienced investors alike to learn about stocks, funds, bonds, and portfolios. Some of the courses you’ll find include “Stocks Versus Other Investments,” “Methods for Investing in Mutual Funds,” “Determining Your Asset Mix,” and “Introduction to Government Bonds.” Each course takes about 10 minutes and is followed by a quiz to help you make sure that you understood the lesson.14
EdX is an online learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.15 It offers at least three courses that cover personal finance: 'Personal Finance, Part 1: Investing in Yourself"" from Wellesley College, “Personal Finance” from Purdue University, and “Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making” from the University of Michigan. These courses will teach you how credit works, which types of insurance you might want to carry, how to maximize your retirement savings, how to read your credit report, and what the time value of money is.16
“Planning for a Secure Retirement” is an online course from Purdue University. It’s broken up into 10 main modules, and each has four to six sub-modules on topics such as Social Security, 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs. You’ll learn about your risk tolerance, think about what kind of retirement lifestyle you want, and estimate your retirement expenses.17
Podcasts

Personal finance podcasts are a great way to learn how to manage your money if you’re short on free time. While you’re getting ready in the morning, exercising, driving to work, running errands, or preparing for bed, you can listen to expert advice on becoming more financially secure. In addition to “The Investopedia Express with Caleb Silver,” you may find these valuable:

Freakonomics Radio and NPR’s Planet Money both make economics enjoyable by using it to explain real-world phenomena such as “how we got from mealy, nasty apples to apples that actually taste delicious,” the Wells Fargo fake-accounts scandal, and whether we should still be using cash.
American Public Media’s Marketplace helps make sense of what’s happening in the business world and the economy.
So Money with Farnoosh Torabi combines interviews with successful business people, expert advice, and listeners’ personal finance questions.

The most important thing is to find resources that work for your learning style and that you find interesting and engaging. If one blog, book, course, or podcast is dull or difficult to understand, keep trying until you find something that clicks.

Education shouldn’t stop once you learn the basics. The economy changes, and new financial tools like the budgeting apps mentioned earlier are always being developed. Find resources you enjoy and trust, and keep refining your money skills through retirement and beyond.

What Personal Finance Classes Can’t Teach You

Personal finance education is a great idea for consumers, especially people starting out who want to learn investing basics or about credit management; however, understanding the basic concepts is not a guaranteed path to financial sense. Human nature can often derail the best intentions to achieve a perfect credit score or build a substantial retirement nest egg. These three key character traits can help you stay on track:

Discipline

One of the most important tenets of personal finance is systematic saving. For example, say your net earnings are $60,000 per year, and your monthly living expenses—housing, food, transportation, and the like—amount to $3,200 per month.

There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA).

To be eligible for a health savings account, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).18

Establishing an emergency fund takes financial discipline—without it, giving in to the temptation to spend rather than save can have dire consequences. In the event of an emergency, you may not have the money to pay the expenses—leading you to finance them through debt.

Once you have your emergency stash, you'll need to develop investing discipline—it’s not just for institutional money managers who make their living buying and selling stocks. Average retail investors tend to do better by setting an investment target and abiding by it rather than buying and selling stocks trying to time the market.

A Sense of Timing

Timing can be crucial. For instance, imagine you're three years out of college, have established your emergency fund, and want to reward yourself. A Jet Ski costs $3,000, but you want to start investing also. ""Investing in growth stocks can wait another year,"" you say. ""I have plenty of time to launch an investment portfolio.""

However, putting off investing for one year can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying a personal watercraft can be illustrated through the time value of money.

The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a growth mutual fund over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 65.

Doing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. If you were to put the Jet Ski on your credit card, the $3,000 credit card balance would take 222 months (18.5 years) to pay off if you only made minimum payments of $75 each month. And don’t forget the interest you’re paying: at an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months. So, if you were to plunk down the $3,000 to pay the balance rather than let it compound, you'd see substantial savings—nearly $1,000.

Emotional Detachment

Personal finance matters are business, and business should not be personal. A difficult but necessary facet of sound financial decision-making involves removing emotions from a transaction.

Making impulsive purchases feels good but can significantly impact long-term investment goals. So can making unwise loans to family members. Your cousin Fred, who has already burned your brother and sister, will likely not pay you back, either. The smart thing to do is decline his requests for help—you're trying to make ends meet also.

The key to prudent personal financial management is to separate feelings from reason. However, when loved ones are experiencing real trouble, it pays to help if you can—just try not to take it out of your investments and retirement.

Many people have loved ones who always seem to need financial help—it is difficult to refuse to help them. If you include planning to assist them in real emergencies using your emergency fund, it can make the burden easier.

Breaking Personal Finance Rules

The personal finance realm may have more guidelines and tips to follow than any other. Although these rules are good to know, everyone has their own circumstances. Here are some rules prudent people, especially young adults, are never supposed to break—but can break if necessary.

Saving or Investing a Set Portion of Your Income

An ideal budget includes saving a portion of your paycheck every month for retirement—usually around 10% to 20%. However, while being fiscally responsible is important and thinking about your future is crucial, the general rule of saving a given amount for retirement may not always be the best choice, especially for young people just getting started.

For one thing, many young adults and students need to consider paying for their biggest expenses, such as a new car, home, or postsecondary education. Taking away 10% to 20% of available funds would be a definite setback in making those purchases.

Additionally, saving for retirement doesn’t make much sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans to pay off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card probably would negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.

Finally, saving money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who’s still unsure about their life path.

Long-term Investing/Investing in Riskier Assets

The rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a buy-and-hold philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Adapting to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses and sitting idly by and watching your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.

Common investing logic suggests that because young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher-risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses that they may suffer; however, you don’t have to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments if you don’t want to.

The idea of diversification is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended investment horizon.

At the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments—even though these may yield less than inflation—to preserve capital. Taking fewer risks is important as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65, you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments could still make sense for you.

YNAB rises to the top of our list because of its budgeting philosophy. The company offers a free trial for 34 days (no credit card required), and after that, the cost is $109 per year. If you prefer to pay less upfront, the cost is $14.99 per month.1

YNAB allows you to sync your bank accounts, import your data from a file, or manually enter each transaction.2 To begin, the company suggests learning the basics about the app through video courses, a live workshop, or reading a guide. YNAB offers a proactive budgeting approach rather than tracking what you have already spent, like some competitors.3

After signing up, you create your first budget and assign every dollar a purpose, such as your rent or car payment. The goal is to eventually get at least one month ahead, so you’re spending money you earned 30 days ago. The company offers extensive educational resources and customer support to keep you on track.4  

YNAB says privacy and security are its top priority. The company protects your information by using bank-level encryption for all data, best practices for password security, third-party audits, and more.5

The Bottom Line

Budgeting apps are a great tool to help you get a grasp of your finances. But, they don't work on their own. Rather, you have to put in the work and use them consistently to see a difference. This means you can't reach financial goals automatically unless you commit the time and effort to improve your financial situation.

If you’re serious about budgeting apps, YNAB is a top choice thanks to its detailed budgeting strategy, excellent support, and helpful features. Simplifi by Quicken helps you personalize your spending plan while PocketGuard helps you rein in your spending. Empower gives you the best free option and Zeta works well for couples.


Budgeting can help you spend your money in a way that better aligns with your goals, but it won’t magically make more money appear. To do that, you’ll need to look for ways to increase your income.

As inflation rises and the pandemic-era aid winds down, more people are having a rough time managing their money. According to a survey from Payroll.org, 78% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck due to rising inflation.12 And with the rise in interest rates, borrowing money isn’t as easy as it used to be, making budgeting an increasingly popular alternative.  


Guide to Choosing the Best Budgeting App
What Is a Budgeting App?

Budgeting apps are personal finance tools that allow you to create a budget. Many apps require you to sync your bank accounts so you can track your monthly income and categorize expenses. All of your data is automatically imported into the app, which calculates how much money you have left over each month. This can give you an idea of where you can cut your spending and how much money you can set aside savings.


Budgeting may seem like a daunting task. But, it is necessary and doesn't happen on its own if you want to save money. To make it work, you have to put in the effort and do it consistently. Using a budgeting app can help you track your spending and keep your finances in check. You can assign a maximum dollar value to your monthly expenses, allowing you to save hundreds of dollars each month.

How to Choose a Budgeting App

Consider the following tips as you research budgeting apps to choose the right one for you:

Your goals: Determine why you want to use a budgeting app, whether that's to set savings, create an emergency fund, or help you fund a large purchase for the future.
Availability: Determine how you want to use the app and whether it is compatible with your device. It's always a good idea to see if the apps you're researching have desktop capability if you ever need to use them on a computer.
Free trial: Does the app offer a free trial? Free trials allow you to test the features without committing to or paying for an app.
Features: Your goals and financial situation will dictate which features you should seek. Don't commit or pay for an app with too many bells and whistles if you want to make simple changes to your financial life.
Automation: Ask yourself a few key questions. Do you want the app to work for you automatically or are you willing to manually track your finances? Can the app sync up with your bank account and other financial accounts? Keep in mind that you may have to do some manual tracking with certain automated budgeting apps—especially if you use cash for certain transactions.
Cost: How much are you willing to pay for the app? It doesn't make sense to sign up for a complicated app when you can't afford it, especially if it comes with features you won't use. There are also a lot of free budgeting apps that can help keep you on track.
Security: This is important, especially if you intend to link your bank accounts and credit cards to the app. You want to make sure that your financial information is safe and secure from hackers.

The best way to ensure that you have the right app for you is to read reviews and/or get recommendations. You can also speak to a financial professional to see if they can help guide you in the right direction.


Why Having a Budget is Important


Budgeting allows you to stay on track and meet your financial goals—even if you have money to spare each month. You can use a budget to track your income and expenses each month. This can help you cut back on wasteful spending, save money for the future, and reach some of your financial goals, whether that's to save up for a car, vacation, or a new home.

When you're budgeting, make sure you track every dollar that comes and goes out of your hands and your bank account. This includes any money you earn and your fixed and regular monthly bills (rent/mortgage, utilities, credit cards, loans, etc.) as well as any irregular expenses like travel and dining out.

How to Create a Budget


Follow these steps to create your budget:

List your goals. Why are you creating your budget and what would you like to do with your savings? You may be saving up for a big purchase, a vacation, for retirement, or to set aside a rainy day fund. Whatever your goals are, make sure they are realistic.
Determine your monthly income. This includes all of the money you earn every month. Do not include things like tax refunds as things like this will inflate your monthly earning figure.
Calculate your expenses:
Fixed monthly expenses. This should be all fixed expenses, such as housing, car payments, and student debt. Include any other things you pay for that come at a fixed, predictable cost.
Flexible monthly expenses. This list should include anything you spend money on each month that comes with a flexible cost. Groceries, entertainment, travel, and other similar items fall into this category.
Don't forget expenses that occur semi-regularly. Property taxes, insurance, and other expenses that you don't pay monthly but must still be accounted for should go on this list.
Choose your strategy. With the envelope strategy, you set aside cash each month for specific spending goals, such as groceries and entertainment. The 50/30/20 plan involves spending 50% of your income on necessities, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings.
Rework your spending to fit your strategy. Make sure you make adjustments to your habits so you stick to your plan. Consider brown-bagging your lunch rather than buying it or giving up that morning brew from the neighborhood coffee shop to help keep you on track. You may also want to give up the credit card and start using cash.
Automate your payments. Setting up automatic debits can make your life easier because it takes the guesswork out of making your payments and keeping track of them.
Track how you're doing. Keeping tabs on your progress and making minor changes can help you stay on track. For instance, if you've paid off a debt, you can put that money to use in a different category.
Budgeting Apps vs. Expense Tracking Apps


You may have heard about expense tracking apps and are probably wondering how they differ from budgeting apps like the ones we highlighted above.

Budgeting apps allow you to actively manage your money. This means you have a solid grasp of what your income and expenses are each month. This includes setting aside a certain amount of money for groceries and entertainment so you stay within your limits. If you're using budgeting apps, you probably have clear goals about where and how you want to spend your money. Put simply, there are no surprises when it comes to your money because you know how and when it comes in and where it goes.

Expense tracking apps, on the other hand, allow you to paint a picture of how you spend your money each month. These apps record your bill payments and other expenses, such as your nights out, the clothes you buy, and the morning coffee you stop in for on your way to work each morning. At the end of the month, you get a clear picture of where your money went so you can determine if and where you can make adjustments to help you save money.

Check out our list of best expense tracking apps.

If you opt for the cash envelope budgeting method, make sure to keep track of your envelopes very carefully. If you lose an envelope, you can’t get your money back as easily as if you’d used a debit or credit card. 

Pros and Cons of Budgeting Apps
Pros

Ease of access: Mobile access can help at home and while you're on-the-go

Affordable or free: Many options come at a low cost or even free

Fewer errors: Automated syncing and record-keeping eliminates human error

Helpful, automated interfaces: Visuals and insights in real-time can help you with everyday decisions

Cons

Can be difficult to learn: Complex apps can be difficult to navigate and pick up

Cash can be hard to manage: Some apps require extra work if you're using cash

Must have an internet connection for syncing: You can lose access to your app if you don't have a connection

Potential for upsells: Some apps may try to sell you other products and services

Alternatives to Budgeting Apps

Keeping up with a budget is always a great idea but you don’t necessarily need an app to do it. Here are some other popular options in both the digital and analog realms that might work better for you: 

Budgeting software: If you’re not keen on using your phone you can do most—if not more—of the same things on a desktop computer that a mobile app would let you do. You may be able to log in to a program online or download a program on your computer.
Expense tracking apps: Budgeting can seem overwhelming and a good first step for many people is to simply track their spending. If that’s the case, a more streamlined app might be better for you.
Spreadsheet budgeting: Many people choose to make a DIY budget using a paper spreadsheet or a program like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. This lets you customize it how you want, although it is more work to put together and maintain. 
Cash envelope budgeting: You’ll take out paper cash and put it into categorized envelopes such as food, clothing, and gas with this method. This lets you set a stricter budget cap for yourself if you’ve had problems spending too much in the past.
Pay yourself first budgeting: If you hate the idea of budgeting, this method allows you to sidestep it entirely by setting up automated transfers into your savings account, with the remainder left over to spend as you wish. 


You may have heard of the 50/20/30 budget rule. This rule, which was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, suggests dividing your take-home pay three ways: 50% to your needs, 30% to your wants, and 20% to savings.13 Needs represent living expenses and other things you must spend on while wants are things that you don't necessarily need.

Why You Should Trust Us

Budgeting is a challenge for many people. While many folks want to reel in spending, it can be tedious to manually track expenses with a spreadsheet, making giving up all too easy. Luckily, there are budgeting apps to automate the process. But, the market is flooded with free and subscription-based apps, and most people don’t have the time or energy to test each out. Fortunately, we did the heavy lifting for you.

We considered 15 of the best companies on the market, comparing each app’s budgeting functionality, pricing, free trials, and user reviews. We compared the features, educational tools, security, and how each app accesses your financial data.
